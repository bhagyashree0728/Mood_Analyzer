I told my friend that it makes me sad I don‚Äôt have any other friends unlike her. That whenever we fight,  I feel sad or alone, there is really no one I could turn to or there is really no one I could lean on. But she has other friends. At least she has some people she could turn to, make her feel a little better. 

I told her that and she went mad. She said she would never talk to them anymore so that I could be happy. That wasn‚Äôt what I meant! I only told her that because I really feel so lonely having no other friends aside from her. I really feel so sad whenever we have an argument and there is no one I could ask for advice or someone else that will make me feel a little less sad. That‚Äôs all.

i don‚Äôt care if nobody sees this, i just need to get this off my chest

This past year of my life has been the worst, and the coronavirus pandemic is not helping one bit. I‚Äôve just been so lonely and sad, it‚Äôs been effecting my entire life negatively, ruining all my confidence and self-esteem in the process.

I‚Äôm a 21 year old (M) lonely virgin, introverted, and I have good support of friends and family around me who i love and trust. i feel like i shouldn‚Äôt even be down on myself right now and feeling shitty all the time, but the feeling of loneliness is constantly overwhelming me. Everybody I know that is my age or around my age isn‚Äôt a virgin, and whenever I tell someone new that I am a virgin they get a surprised look on their face like, laugh at me, or the worst thing, ask me ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù and it hurts a lot inside. 

These past few years, my friends have all lost their virginity and have gotten into new relationships, leaving me the only one to never be in one. I‚Äôm really happy for them, but i just wish that was me in a relationship. The things that gets to me the most is when I think about how in my 21 year of life, nobody has ever loved me. (love as in a SO type of love)

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve tried many times in the past to find a relationship or hook up with girls in real life and online, but being socially awkward and introverted, nothing ever works out due to me fucking the whole thing up and overthinking everything, or just bad luck (i.e. a girl from bumble ghosted me after 2 weeks of talking all-day, everyday over text)

I don‚Äôt want to tell my friend/family about how i‚Äôve been feeling cuz they‚Äôll probably just tell me to suck it up or call me desperate, which is what i really am at this point, sadly.

(also not like i can do anything right now anyways because if this pandemic)

I don‚Äôt know what point i‚Äôm trying to make here, i‚Äôm just rambling about my stupid problems, so if you took your time to read this whole post, thank you.",lonely,Lonely rant,2020-04-30 14:00:26

She recommended that I took some time off from talking to her as we talked daily and so I did but all I ever wanted was to keep talking to her.

Instead, she kept trying to push me away and claimed that she realized that she hasn‚Äôt been putting a lot of effort into her classes as she practically put me over her studies, which I would‚Äôve never allowed had I known but for her sake, I agreed that it was best that we stopped talking for a bit.

I havnt seen my best friends in a very long time and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to lose one of them. This is not due to social distancing but is because of the path he is going down. He is an adrenaline junky and will do anything for that feeling. I try to keep him out of drugs but he‚Äôs gotten into alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana and I can‚Äôt follow him down that path seeing as I‚Äôm a cadet and lead one of the squads. 

My other best friend lives and Massachusetts and I only get to talk to him a few times  a mont while only getting to physically see him a few times a year.

I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this anymore. 

I broke up with my last girlfriend a year and a half ago and asked out someone I had been flirting back and forth with only to find that she was into ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù and not ‚Äúsnitches‚Äù. Personally that really broke me a lot and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just feel like shit. I want someone I can love and receive love from with ought and super sexual contact.

53,CDR16,1588213410,1,"I wrote this and shared it on my social media the other day. I received some kind words, but somehow I just felt more empty, unheard even. I‚Äôve never posted here before, and I‚Äôm not sure what I hope to gain out of it. Maybe part of me is tired of holding on to all of this. Tired of being the only one who remembers. Tired of being reminded.  There‚Äôs a special kind of loneliness born out of abandonment. There‚Äôs even part of me that‚Äôs afraid to give up the ghost, as I‚Äôm certain to be even more alone. Nonetheless, I‚Äôm desirous of sharing it here:

We would often talk about our shared belief that each of us was here, in this life, for the other.  That that was the reason we were here.

And part of me, to this day, part of me still believes that loving her is the reason I am here.  Though, it has become clear that she used that belief of mine to suit her needs until it no longer suited her needs

I had my entire life taken from me.  By both of them.  They worked together to take it all away from me.  

There was no discussion.  There was no working it out.

She was done with me.  She was done with the life we created, together.  And, more importantly, she was firmly seated *in* her next life.

And now he has my fairy tale ending.  MY love. MY dream come true. He has the woman who shaped my heart and taught me how to love.  Who taught me that I could love.  Who, for the first time in my entire life, gave me something to be proud of.  

A woman who, as if in a boy‚Äôs dream, gave this man his purpose, gave me my purpose.

And so, this, the lone truth in a night‚Äôs sky dotted with lies.. she left me. Here, in this space, place, and home that we built together.  She left me in the world I loved and worked so hard to build to be certain that it would never crack or crumble beneath her. Little did I know that I had built it strong enough and high enough for her to fly away.

Some time ago, she had written a list of all she found at odds with within her and carelessly left it out where it was easily seen.  Each and every thing she found lacking in her life, in our relationship, in me.  One by one, these things lined the page.  As the list grew longer and more specific, the more it became clear precisely what this ultimately was.. a Pros &amp; Cons list for what she might experience if she stayed, here and together.  Only, no words written in the Pros column.  The very last thing listed was a mystery to me at the time.  Everything else legible and identifiable.. but these two words seemed to be.. ‚Äúdeny te‚Äù?

My mind couldn‚Äôt understand it through the noise brought into my head by the litany of shortcomings she found as described in the words written above it.  And why it took me this long to translate I‚Äôll never know.  But it was criminally simple.  The very last thing on the list of what might be, if she stayed in our life, was that she would deny T.E., his initials.  

Him, her boss, he who conspired with her to leave me, to hurt me. He who drove her truck to our home with her in her own passenger seat to collect the last of her belongings only a short time after she departed to ‚Äògo find herself‚Äô T.E., the one behind her dead-eyed promise that he wasn‚Äôt a factor in her decision, that she and T.E. had not the romantic interludes and secret meetings I had long suspected.  

He, who, had received gifts from her mother who had sent a care package to our home, while we together, with gifts for his daughters he had partial custody of after his wife left him because my she broke the two of them up.  Their coworkers saw this unfold as I couldn‚Äôt. My she removed from his team, away from his purview, so that any further conflict of interest and outright favoritism for promotion was halted.  

He, part of that care package from her mother, a care package with items for him, for her, and not one thing for me.  We opened it together, she and I, and when she realized what the box contained and what the note her mother wrote said, she turned her back to me, placing her body between my eyes and the note.

With this, and countless other ‚Äòcoincidences‚Äô made clear with the passage of time, my world was taken from me, and nearly my life shortly thereafter.  I don‚Äôt speak of the latter often..

I never had a say in it any of it.  She and T.E. decided for me.  And neither had the courage to stand up with their shared truth.  Only the courage to run into their own story, into their shared home in the nearby town that we once lived in, into the next of her lifelong series of runnings she deemed ‚Äòwild‚Äô with misappropriated bravery.

I was left holding the memories and the tattered fabric of a union with the love of my life.  I was gaslighted into thinking my actions were cause.  I was lied to while actively being told to believe. 

Everyone but me knew why.  Everyone but me knew what.  And everyone but me knew who. 

Some of you reading this knew, and each of you who knew were, and continue to be, ok with it.

Well, I‚Äôm still here.  

I‚Äôm still where she left me.

I‚Äôm the one who hurts

I‚Äôm the one alone

I‚Äôm the one who feels lost

I‚Äôm the one who feels broken 

I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs scared

And, like that foolish dream-struck boy, I still love her.

When one loves as I loved her, it never goes away. Not a love like that.

Though parts of my heart may whisper faint echoes of hope, there just isn‚Äôt any.

It has become devastatingly clear that there never was.

So, if you‚Äôve seen me, or spoken with me, texted, or emailed.. if you‚Äôve crossed into connection with me and sensed that things seemed off, seemed different. That perhaps I‚Äôve been keeping things closer to the chest, or that I might be struggling with something. That I might be sad.  If you‚Äôve ever wondered if or why my spark and bright light had dimmed.. well, this.

This is what I carry with me.

This is what hides behind my eyes

This is the heart that I‚Äôve lead with into and through every endeavor in each of my days, broken.

And while this is all unspeakably difficult for me to share, I couldn‚Äôt be more sorry",lonely,"Even if I knew a way out of this, I‚Äôd still take you with me..",2020-04-30 12:23:30
54,ssprue20,1588213254,1,"I have had a really tough week but with enough support, I am trying my best to get by while under unfortunate circumstances. I have been writing a short story as a reflection of my depression and desire for the end of my life. It is in a way, a venting mechanism of reminding me that life doesn't have to be bad, I can make life the way I want it to even when I feel like I am cannot control everything whatsoever. I am going through a lot. Living in Japan as an English Teacher, an entirely new life with weak Japanese skills but I guess it wouldn't hurt to try to keep going as much as there are days when I just want it all to end. I know that won't make anything better. My family and friends would be devastated. Sometimes I wish nobody cares about me so that I can just end it, but that is not the case for me unfortunately. While I am trying to get better with my Japanese and hopefully become a good teacher for my students when school opens back up (hopefully...), and hopefully find the love of my life, I want to keep making my art. Writing short stories, drawing sketches, and making short films; all to lead the story I have been cowriting with my best friend. This story has been in my head for as long as I can remember. I am not a great writer and I probably never will be a great writer but I do want to see this long epic story come to fruition one day. It is definitely my passion project. I don't want to go too much into it but let's just say that it is heavily inspired by The Lord of the Rings and Berserk. A lot of characters will die. I want to be the new George RR Martin but with enough spice and quality. I don't want to make shock value just for the sake of shock value. That is what I love about Berserk. Every time I go back, there is always something new I discover. Guts has taught me that no matter how tough and awful life can make for you, there is maybe a chance to take that sword back up and say ""this is my life, my choice, my destiny"". I want to give that to my story. I want to touch people's hearts and let them know that there is always a chance of light at the end of the tunnel behind all the darkness life has to offer. Forgive my blabbering. As you can see, I have dreams and I hope those dreams will come to me one day. I want people to be happy.

I lived on a farm in Tennessee and all my uncles and my grandpa and father hunted and fished and we always had a giant garden every year. I learned a lot, and these past 2 years I‚Äôve taught myself even more. 


I‚Äôm 19, male, and in Ohio now. Had a couple truly bad experiences working, and am graduating in like a month. I have never had a girlfriend. I have never held hands with a girl, never hugged a girl, never kissed a girl, I am still a virgin. I‚Äôve talked to a couple girls online, but they just don‚Äôt like me. They always leave. I am truly undesirable. I‚Äôm ugly 


I have a plan to go to Alaska and squat in the woods around 2023, I got a group of a few guys and am working on even more. Live off the land, far out of reach of law and order. I‚Äôve learned so much, almost every day I‚Äôm becoming a better hunter, fisherman, trapper, learning more wild edibles and more primitive skills. After about 6-8 months of trying I finally managed to start my own bow drill fire. I‚Äôm bang on with my damn bow, can hit shit at 40-50 yards pretty consistently. I know dozens of primitive traps, fishing techniques, I‚Äôve eaten about every animal there is to eat in Ohio. Not trying to brag, cuz it isn‚Äôt shit people respect or care about, but I‚Äôm a hell of a woodsman and am only getting better. I think we‚Äôd be able to do really good out there. 



The problem is that in the end it is all for nothing. I will never be able to have an intimate relationship with a female. My facial bone structure and dick size and my socioeconomic class seem to make me completely undesirable. All this shit I‚Äôve put time and effort into, learning to live off the land, the anarchist manifesto, the Alaska thing, it all ends with me. I‚Äôll never have a son to pass my shotgun down to or a daughter to teach how to work a garden or do setlines. I‚Äôll never have a girl to lay on the cabin roof and watch the northern lights with.

I never really had a father figure growing up. My mom got with my current ""stepdad"" very soon after my dad died which makes me resent her for moving on that fast. I'm the kinda short smart weird kid that everyone avoids because my mother is super controlling and emotionally abusive. I dont have very many friends because of this, but the ones I do have seem to be getting distant. I've never had a relationship or anything so I constantly feel lonely because there is no one to love or care for in my life. Almost all my friends have found someone or are at least able to. My best friend moved away last year and that made me more depressed than normal, but he moved back earlier this year which raised my hopes a little. Most of my friends have jobs and girlfriends so they never have time for me. And then bam QUARANTINE. This just made all the feelings of emptiness inside me even worse. Being that my mom is controlling, I am not allowed to leave the house at all. I have been inside this box for almost 6 weeks straight, I have not left once. This is bad especially for me because if I dont have much social interaction I tend to slip into mild depression. I already have social anxiety and moderate depression as it is so not being able to do anything that I enjoy is making it worse. And to top it off I'll be going away to college this fall, but I do not have a way to get there. I have no car, no money, no job, nothing. And I'm expected to go to college and pay for my own car and insurance and gas, with no job.

# The Cycle of Misery

In Mathematics, cyclic or periodic patterns are a very important phenomenon and have found use in most astonishing applications. Perfectly repeating patterns with universal regularity are indeed awe-inspiring and seem to be an epitome of pure Platonic Forms. Today however I‚Äôd like to talk about a different kind of cyclic phenomenon - a cycle of misery. It is as cruel as it is dreadful. It concerns the ritual of making a conversation. You might dismiss me by saying that such a banal thing as ‚Äòconversation‚Äô deserves no attention. But if you could find the patience, I can assure you that you‚Äôd find it most amusing. In conversation, as in any human activity, we presuppose a certain ritual, a set of rules adhering to a pattern, for it to be carried out in an acceptable manner. These rules are almost self-evident, like a mathematical axiom, and are thus often left unstated. But if you suffer from the sickness that I do, even that much can‚Äôt be taken for granted. And hence, I propose to analyze it in some detail here. More specifically, I intend to demonstrate (by way of example) how the simple assumption of ‚Äòreciprocity‚Äô breaks down, if - as was mentioned earlier - you suffer from a particular sickness.

For pedagogical reasons, and for ease of exposition, I‚Äôll divide the cycle into a sequence of four phases that I find most natural:

1. Inspiration
2. Overcoming
3. Anticipation
4. Humiliation

Inspiration serves as an excuse for conversation, or at least an attempt at conversation. For instance, let‚Äôs say that you were reading Dostoevsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúNote from the Underground‚Äù and realize an eerie similarity with another work of fiction, that is, ‚ÄúOne, No one, and a Hundred Thousand‚Äù. So you write a message. You include one or two short excerpts from both novels and write how amazing and beautiful it is that these two novels are talking about the same thing. You draw some interesting parallels (well, interesting to you at least). In that moment, you allow yourself to be deluded by a sense of momentary pride, even an envious, degrading kind of joy.

‚ÄúSurely, this will spark a good conversation!‚Äù, you think. After all, you remember them talking about their interest in Dostoevsky, and how they loved to read this and that work of his. Surely, they‚Äôd find this interesting. You don't have many conversations, but the ones you do have, you remember in all vivid details - almost verbatim, and could play them in your mind, repeatedly. Either amusing yourself by analyzing the most mundane and minute details or torturing yourself by attempting to deconstruct the thoughts of speakers to uncover the slightest hint of contempt or disgust, which you believe they must be hiding all too well. But their interest in Dostoevsky seemed genuine and not out of spite for you and appeared neither to be a vicious prank. You remember their innocent face.

This allows you to overcome your shame and hope that this time it would turn out to be different. You‚Äôre confident, much to your own surprise. So, you send the message and wait in anticipation. This is the part where you read your message several times, to find if you hadn‚Äôt said anything that could be interpreted the wrong way. Did you say too much? Or too little? Do you come off as pretentious? demanding? You distract yourself with whatever means necessary and even think of some scenarios in which the conversation might proceed. You take note of some obvious eventualities and repeat in your mind some other interesting parts of the two novels that you could talk about. You don‚Äôt want to be boring, or shallow. Having done so, you are now satisfied, and prepared. If this conversation extends for a couple of minutes you might even find the energy to function for a week, or two. After all, you are not greedy. The bare minimum would be enough.

Time passes, and almost when you have successfully pretended to not care too much about it, your phone chimes. Your heart races. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it worked!‚Äù, you say to yourself. Your hands freeze in anticipation as you reach for your phone. You unlock it and read the message. It says: ‚Äú**lol. That‚Äôs nice**‚Äù. You keep staring at the screen, waiting for them to continue the conversation that you had so carefully choreographed. Seconds go by. Fading then into a minute. Then two, and three. Nothing. Your screen goes dark. Then you realize what has just happened. The illusion is over, you are jolted back to reality. Your body aches, then your soul. This is not the first time, however. Rather, you are quite familiar with this feeling but it does not make it any more bearable. In the most deafening of silence you sit. Defeated and exhausted, mourning and grieving the humiliation that you have just suffered. No one will ever know. At this moment you are most terrifyingly alone. You can feel every fibre of your soul on fire. Your breath is becoming labored, your eyes turn moist, and your body is almost giving up. Screaming into the void, you are denied even the slightest satisfaction of an echo. After a while, you get your composure back and lie down in a stoic ambivalence. You can‚Äôt blame them. This was - from inception to conclusion - an illusion of your own making. An elaborate joke that you played on yourself.

You took your offering to the gods, but they rejected it. Their judgment was total. You are not worthy. And as is characteristic of gods, they offer you no explanation, no reason, that you may console yourself, that you might identify some shortcoming or mistake on your part in carrying out the ritual and in doing so maybe even harbor some hope of repentance and acceptance. None. Their judgement is arbitrary, but nevertheless certain. Your offering is not enough. You are not enough.

With this humiliation and shame your Sysiphian cycle is complete. 

That is, until the next time you feel ‚Äúinspired‚Äù.",lonely,The Cycle of Misery,2020-04-30 01:01:41

i literally just do enough, and that's it. i feel so heavy all the time. the studying process isn't even that stressful, i mean if i wasn't so lonely im sure it would be way easier. but i fucked that as well

its my first year. it started off perfect. i was a bit nervous, obviously. which i think is only normal. i got to know to everyone, it went real well. i became the most popular. and it was my main goal too at that time. but then everything start to fall apart.

for some stupid ass reason i stopped talking to literally everyone, i got lonely. well i still talk to them, but i dont hang around with anyone. i dont even use any social media, for particular reasons, and that doesn't help too.

basically, its pretty heavy. and then the fucking exams, grades, etc. as i said, i have some fucked up grades. well at least i didnt fail. well i did, only one class. but fuck. FUCK.

mentally its so hard. and now i started to have some new classes, which are even harder. thanks god we have the lockdown and the online studying. i cheat a lot. but it will end some day.

basically, there are many more things that bother me outside college, but the fact that it adds up doesn't help at all.

i really dont know what to do.

yes i might think a bit dramatically now, but sometimes i do feel hopeless. thanks god im not prone to depression tho. cuz i think i do have a reason. well, the loneliness mainly.

and plus that im also not happy with some other shit, like the fact that im not famous, influential, that i dont got every girl at my feet, etc.

yes i know it sounds stupid, but it really is my life goal tbh. not fame, for the sake of being famous, but yea, i really want to be known for something. like, i really want to live an exceptional life, i really do strive for that.

i have also developed this mindset that does help me a bit. It's a bit anti-social (meaning that it goes against the standards of society), but it helps me. Like rn, as a human, as an organism, im not obliged to do shit. im not obliged to study, to make money, to work for someone in order to live. i can do whatever in hell i want, i can move freely, on this planet, there are no borders realistically. and yes i know that it shouldnt be like that, and its stupid to live that way, since its how animals are and we humans have evolved, have become smarter and started to have a better system, but its just the way i started to perceive the world and it does help. a bit at least.

another thing that helps me to go a bit psycho, like i dont give a fuck about anyone. i could stab a nigga throat, and i wouldn't give a fuck

109,xadlyph,1588154501,1,"Long read of me just retelling my life so turn away if you don't like those. 

I'm an introvert, let's say I can mingle with friends but I always feel left alone or that I put up a facade just to go with the flow. Likewise, my social battery is low and my ""friend"" in class is the one person I cling to because without him I'd be sitting in the canteen or library alone.

**Backstory**
I moved countries when I was turning 12 yrs old in hopes of a better life. However, our life instead became chaotic with family issues and naturally I hid inside my shell, depriving myself of social interaction. I was a shut-in, barely talked to my parents but I still go to school. I had a group of friends in school but it was more like if I don't hang out with them then I'd be a loner, they were also my escape from the issues I have at home so I did not want to lose that.

Fast forward, I was told that we were going back to our country after that year. I was shocked but it felt like there's nothing I could do and crying won't do anything about it, my mom cried a lot though. So with that, I vowed to never get close with my friends because it'll hurt like hell when I leave. But I made a mistake and started to go out with them more on the latter half of that year, just a few months before our flight.

I was relatively poor compared to my friends, I can't buy cool clothes or sneakers like them and likewise I can't afford high-end PCs and games so we could play together. I only played lower and lax games and that's the little bit of happiness I had at home along with anime and other stuff. So of course I did not have any significant presence in my group of friends whatsoever. I'm sure a lot of you would relate to the thoughts: **""If I disappear, will they care?""**

I only had myself to cope with my issues, I gave myself the attention I needed. This made a huge effect on me because now I feel drained when too many people give me attention or require my attention, my battery drains really fast. I'm used to being alone but it also hurts that I'm lonely. 

It felt like that all throughout my adolescence. So the last time I met with my old group of friends was the day before school started, I just didn't enroll. I cut contacts and made a full **reset**. My flight was still 2 months away from the first day of school so basically I was ""quarantined"" at home waiting for my flight, I did not have any friends.

**Afterstory**
After permitting myself to cry for the first time in so long on the plane, we went back to our old country. The first few months were lonely and chaotic still but I calmed myself. I decided that since it is a reset, might as well make use of it. I decided to improve, cut my emo hair, improved my fashion sense, tried to be more friendly and start approaching people first. I made a lot of good friends on my first year after going back to my old country but of course good things don't last long. That year was actually the last year before we go to Senior Highschool. After that, everyone went to different schools and lived separate lives. I was alone again. 

I did not want it to stop there, I tried befriending the people in my new class but I'm far too different culturally since I lived in a different country in my most important years.

**Present**
So now in quarantine, despite being an introvert, I'm feeling lonely. Naturally, as a shut-in I hardly had any contact with girls, most of my friends that are girls are online friends. However, I met this girl and we had a thing for a few months. I broke it off mid-quarantine since I'm feeling stressed with online classes and other stuff and I can't give her the attention she wants. She found a new guy literally right after I sent a long message explaining why I can't keep going.

That just hurt like hell, even though I knew from the start this won't lead to anything, the thought of her saying I was replaceable, not disposable, made me sick. They were in a sense complete lies, made me feel insignificant. I describe myself as a Positive Pessimist so this isn't really enough to hurt me that much. But what hurt the most was realizing what happened after I broke it off.

**I was back in square one**
Just like the 2 months before my flight, I was alone and had no friends. I'm stuck in my room but in different scenarios, but I was nonetheless stuck and alone in my room. My PMs are dead, I have nobody to talk to. What hurts me the most as well is that I never had a squad, or rather the squad in front of me never felt like I belonged in it. I don't have any gaming friends because I'm bad at games in the first place. I can't play big games. I don't have ""the boys"" to help me get through life.

111,Spirited_Gene,1588148066,1,"I am 20 years old girl from central Europe. I am currently a college art student.

Through out my life, I never had many friends, I am a bit socially awkward in some situations, but I don't think I am that weird. I am being told I am cute, because I look younger that I actually am, and I am quite short.

During these times, I came to the realization I dont have almost anyone to talk to on frequent basis. I have two best friends from high school, but they both study in different cities than me, but we are in contact through messenger. I also have a boyfriend and we call daily (we cannot see each other now, he is from neighbour country, but otherwise we share the college flat), but he too suggested I should make more friends irl.

I don't know why, no one really texts me first, even when I do make plans with the person and we hang out, they never initiate even though I had a feeling they enjoyed the time spent together. I have no one to go out with on Friday nights.

I had so many people I talked to at elementary school, then eventually at high school it was less people, but I was still seeing them every day, even living with few of my classmates. But now at college, I didnt manage to befriend people and fit in. I am in contact only with the other five people in my class year, but we dont really have anything in common. Two of them seem completely fake to me, only caring how to look good online, and that is really tiring. I would appreciate someone down to earth, (but as I said, I am a bit socially awkward so its difficult with me) but I dont know how to find those people. Everyone at the colllege already seems to fit in some group of friends, so its hard to get in it now.

Its like I am from completely different world, i dont know how to find people on the same wave as me, in real life. Online its easy of course. Recently I started running and working out, thanks to my boyfriend and it seems like this kind of people might be it, they all seem really friendly, and most importantly, they dont care about pointless, shallow things and consumerism.

My interests are books, philosophy, illustrating, nature, travelling, self development, spiritualism, meditation, I am trying to live as zero waste and healthy as possible.

My idea of happiness is travelling with just my backpack. I have hitchhiked trough Europe when I was 18-19 with my high school friends and it was the happiest I have ever been.

113,nobodynoone888,1588146752,1," Wow... I'm surprised that most of the comments have to do with loneliness and depression and not about love... Here's my sadistic take on life: Everyone loves me. I have parents who love me, a loving sister, amazing friends, most of which are female... They (my friends) all tell me, ""You're great, Gilbert. You deserve someone special, you'll find someone. You're so nice and sweet."" But not a single one of them (the female ones) would even consider being anything more than friends with me. This is because I'm a ""nice guy"". I'm not a sex-crazed heartless douchebag like many guys I know. I make the best first impressions because of this and have gotten close to having relationships with girls. As quickly as they come, however, they go. They find out that I'm socially awkward, that I have autism, that I'm really boring, really really weird, emotional, and clingy. They find out that I've been bullied and verbally abused for most of my life and they decide that they don't want to carry all of that. Either that, or they simply get turned off by the fact that I'm so fucking ugly. Everyone loves me, but nobody ""likes"" me. I'm just not meant to be with anyone.     I listened to this first song when I was convinced that my crush would never like me, and here I am again now that it's over.   Everything changed one day when she admitted that she did indeed like me back. We planned to be in an official relationship after the social distancing ended. We talked one the phone a lot.

Not even with their divorce, that's simply why I moved out. I mean more so that I've lost all hope in finding someone to be with. Tinder doesn't work, all the females on there have ""this is just for fun"" or ""this account is a joke"" in their bio. I don't think I'm a terrible looking guy, albeit not the best looking, but not terrible.

Having nice things does not do it for me. Sure it's calming to be surrounded by good energy, but there's a void. One that I wish someone could fill with love, but I really don't see it happening.

I'm just not social enough, I guess. That and I feel like everyone I meet doesn't really like me, they just deal with me because they don't want to tell me to leave.

115,jasonmason1233456,1588145320,1,"hello, i am having trouble with loneliness and have been having this feeling for quite a while. This isn‚Äôt because of the coronavirus, though, I have been having this problem since the beginning of my new school year. I met this group of people who have my same interests, (video games) and I joined the video game club. I kind of feel left out because I know they text each other and have groupchats, but I am sorta bad at developing friendships. I am jealous because there are freshman in the friend group that are basically ingrained in the social circle and I am a sophomore and I can‚Äôt even walk up to them because i‚Äôm nervous!!! Basically everyone in the video game club takes orchestra and before taking seats they talk in groups and I am nervous they will think I am weird for coming up to them or desperate or lonely! During the quarantine, the teacher posted these questions asking if we brought home our instruments and everyone from the video game club basically said their answer at the same time. Which basically leads me to believe that they texted each other about the post the teacher made and told them to answer it. I go up to them sometimes and talk to like 1 person in the friend group, but she never really makes an effort to talk to me. she asked me for my phone number but I think she forgot about it and never talked to me. But we have each other on discord and sometimes we talk to each other like when I ask questions but I would like to talk to her more as a friend. Also, I play Smash Bros Ultimate with them when they‚Äôre together and during lunch I go to the video game club. After lunch, I go to orchestra, and I feel like they ignore me (but not actually) and i feel left out and I want to be part of this group but I am socially anxious. I even asked out a member of the social circle a long time ago, but now it‚Äôs not as awkward.

I am a 24 year old male. I have never been in a relationship before and to be frank, it's because I am very ugly, like a 2/10. I am facially deformed albeit slightly, due to multiple injuries I sustained as a baby and toddler. I have accepted that I will spend of my life alone. No girl wants to be with me. But, I am totally okay with that. I am very turned off by bodies in general because I find them gross, it is too much to get into detail. No, I am not asexual, I think, because I still jerk off to porn, way too much. I have a porn addiction that I just can't quit. I do have friends but honestly, I don't value them in the slightest. I would be okay if I never saw them again. I have no desire to keep any of my friends. It's not that I am antisocial, on the contrary, I am actually a very social person by nature. I think I may just be a lone wolf. 

For anyone who's interested: I have had three crushes in my entire life, the first one [2008 - 2009] being very short-lived with no attachment whatsoever (she thought I was one of the ugliest guys in class). The second one [2010 - 2014] lasting for years and became an obsession (she turned me down after I told her about my feelings, basically blamed it on my looks).

129,Lefunnyman009,1588134988,1,"Sometimes in life everything just sucks right? Well for me I feel like every minute of my life truly does suck but it‚Äôs clouded by the few material things I own and the ‚Äúpassions‚Äù I so have. Let me rephrase. It isn‚Äôt that everything sucks it‚Äôs that everything is mediocre and 99% of the human race shall be stuck to this mediocrity. Everyone talks about overrated and underrated and mediocrity in everything and I just feel like everything I like and love is overrated and doesn‚Äôt deserve my attention and everything in my actual life is mediocre. I‚Äôm a geek and love comics, superheroes, sci fi and all that shit. But fuck man should I find new things to like and abandon everything I like now. Marvel movies are overrated and the comics have gone to shit, DC has few good properties and the comics are going to shit as well, Star Wars will never win and will always be divided among the fans, Video games are just the same mediocre shooters or adventure games or whatever genre and do nothing innovative because the industry can‚Äôt afford such creativity. Modern art in general seems mediocre and not worth liking. The way the word mediocre is used it‚Äôs basically just as bad as....... well bad. Being mediocre means you‚Äôll just be passed by and not have another look taken at you. Least with being bad you‚Äôre bad and something is unique about you or the art or whatever the subject is. Everything is the same and not many people have the tools, will, or means to be unique. Then if everyone is unique then that becomes the new mediocre. In the end no one wins and no one will ever win. You‚Äôre all losers whether you think it or not. Those who think are the winners of life or whatever specific thing will be that way for awhile until something out ranks you. I just want to quit everything at this point. Everything I love is turning to shit and is mediocre now. Seriously being mediocre is the fuckn worst. Then here‚Äôs real life and me. I‚Äôm a fat ugly slug who will die alone and only has decades worth of comic book and sci fi knowledge to pass down. If things aren‚Äôt mediocre than their hateful and I hate too. Seriously everything fucking sucks tbh I just want to watch the world burn. Yeah I know Dark Knight quote and it also makes me look mentally unstable ish which I might be but no one is ever gonna know or give a shit. As I‚Äôm typing rn I‚Äôve probably made so many mistakes that I will not fix since I give no fucks. Seriously everything is such a mediocre cycle of bullshit. Dating sucks since I will never be able to date again in my older age, art like music, video games, comics, sci fi. drawing is just so mediocre now and filled with shit that just sucks. Everything fucking sucks. Therapy is whatever because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve gotten better at all and I‚Äôm just a ticking time bomb ready to kill myself eventually. Things just suck man they suck so bad. It‚Äôs not even the Corona virus shit that makes me see and feel this. It‚Äôs just made me realize again how things are. I can‚Äôt like anything without it being mediocre and therefore deemed as bad or overrated and not deserving of the love and praise I give it. I hate that I can‚Äôt ever truly just like anything because something will always tell me to not like it. Then older people or tougher people will just call me pussy and a weakling if I ever expressed these feelings of mine. So now I can‚Äôt even feel the emotions I feel without feeling like I don‚Äôt deserve to feel or feel wrong and weak for feeling at all. The irony drives me fucking insane. Like what am I gonna do. People say that you shouldn‚Äôt care what others think but how do you even do that. People are everywhere and in important situations you have to care what people think of you to even get through life. You gotta have a good resume to make your boss‚Äôs opinion of you high so they can higher you. Your partner has to think of you as a good partner to have a relationship. You have to have an overall good vibe and extrovert like attitude to make friends. You have to care what people think about you. It‚Äôs how the world functions and there‚Äôs nothing anyone on this godforsaken earth can do about it. And since I‚Äôm young and have negative thoughts most of the time now the older people or people with worse situations will call me ungrateful or a bitch for complaining when they have it worse. So that goes back to my previous point on feelings. What‚Äôs the point of living or existing. Nothing matters and you‚Äôll never win. You‚Äôll live a mediocre life and always wish for more. And for those who are somehow complacent with their life‚Äôs I applaud you. I am in awe of how people can truly be complacent sometimes. I‚Äôm jealous people who just have it so much better and knowing you have no logical way of doing these things. I missed when I was a kid and could just enjoy things and not think about the logistics behind these things. Shit sucks man.

Anyway, I guess this is a rant. I haven‚Äôt felt loved in a long, long time. And for the most part, I just deal with that and go about my business with that in the back of my mind, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt too bad. I‚Äôm 16, and I do not speak with anyone at my school. I do not have friends. That isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúhaha I don‚Äôt have friends‚Äù joke, I simply don‚Äôt have friends. After moving twice within two years, and breaking things off my tumultuous best friend, I was left with no one. I miss the feeling of having friends. I desperately want to find people like me to just have good times with. I used to be the most popular and fun person in my friend group back at my old school. I feel like a shell of myself. That girl is just...gone. 

I tried to accept the fact that I don‚Äôt have friends outside of the family and just try to make friends when I can but, it‚Äôs weird when you tell people you genuinely don‚Äôt know anyone? And then you give them your social media and you have 3 posts and 50 followers...they kinda think you‚Äôre a creep or something. Okay, whatever, I‚Äôll just try and rely on my small family for love and support. 

But that doesn‚Äôt really work either. My mom is severely depressed and doesn‚Äôt have the emotional energy to help me. A few weeks ago, I came home from school and I guess I just didn‚Äôt feel good because I started sobbing in the room. I couldn‚Äôt help it, I was just crying like a baby. And my mom came by the room and called out to my little sister, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go in there, she‚Äôs being pathetic.‚Äù I cried harder because I realized I just want to be loved. I want to be held, and talked to. Because I don‚Äôt have friend, I crave the unconditional love my parents gave me when I was little, lol. But I‚Äôm almost an adult, now, and I think they are done with that, and don‚Äôt want to be hug me or talk with me anymore. 

I pretty much chill all day knowing no one gives a shit about me, and it barely hurts. But then sometimes, it get really fucking painful out of nowhere?

144,spacepaddybogger,1588129313,1,"I married my best friend. We had a sexual relationship,bf/gf and when she asked me to marry her it just seemed like she read my mind. 4 years into the marriage, no fightings or warnings, I woke up one morning and she was gone with the dog. So I worried, every blonde woman I see around I would hope it was her. I went to bed alone not knowing wtf was going on a lot. I got an email two weeks later saying she had left ireland back to America and it's over. Words can't describe what I was going through at the time. The home lease just happened to only be in her name and the landlord eventually kept asking where is she, even though he was being paid. I came home one day to the locks changed. I was homeless. I spent nearly 2 years after that drinking everyday, alcohol for breakfast right to bed time. I don't even like the stuff but it helped not burst into tears. I knew eventually I'd have to process the pain but continued to numb myself. She blocked me on everything and still to this day doesn't know I spent a year living in a homeless shelter because of her and the landlord robbed my belongings. 

I didn't have eyes for a new woman in my life because my wedding vows would guilt trip me. Sure she could come back, our last phone call she was crying and said she wasn't going to apply for a divorce and then blocks my number. I still don't know if I'm married or not, the divorce papers would of went to the old landlords address. One of the hardest parts about this is if there was something wrong I wish she could of came to me and given me the opportunity to correct the situation, instead she abandoned me in a rootless way.

Well now I feel like I'm ready for a new connection and each contact with someone is very disappointing. I've always had at least one good friend. My old school buddies don't live in the country anymore. A date with a woman can turn bad fast because my honesty in telling them I was married sparks curiosity and a fun Friday night turns into me talking about my asshole ex wife. 

I was always ok with my own company but now I'm actually reaching out and it's going no where consistently, I've never felt so lonely.  

People judge me,so I suppose it's worth mentioning I'm not an alcoholic and I wouldn't recommend doing what I did. It just happened to be the only thing available that worked for me.

147,hamartiated,1588128393,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-29 12:46:33

154,astronaut1307,1588127484,1,"I had major depression in 2016... went from being an alpha male to a full fledged wuss. Every time I tried to tell a person how i felt(family, friends, ex), they would follow with ""Shutup"" ""Nobody cares"" ""Stop making people feel bad for you"" and so on.

 One day I decided ""They're right"" and I picked myself up by the fucking bootstrap. I would wake up every morning to tell myself ""I'm a fucking man! I dont need anybody but my damn self."" I would literally ignore women that liked me, people that wanted to be friends, my old friends, and anything that had nothing to do with my life goals. I went balls to the wall for 4 years straight 10+ hours a day with reading, writing, basketball, entrepreneurship and cooking. 

Now I'm proud to say that thou was able to uplift thyself from the self inflicted tyranny

Although I have this new sense of self, theres definitely a deep sense of loneliness still there. For the last 6 months I've tried dating apps but it always results in ghosting or no response, I've even tried approaching in person... but to no avail. Haven't had 1 date after trying 100's of times!

Not gonna lie, I did a a bit of sulking for the last 2 weeks and almost became that whiny lil wuss I was 4 years ago. I snapped out of it and said ""Fuck it, I'll try one more time at work"" So I asked this girl, who seemed to be interested in me, if she was down to hangout but she rejected me before I could finish my sentence.

I don't fit in anywhere. Not nerdy enough for the ""nerds"", to normal for the outcast. Self aware to a degree thats mostly just painful. I have a little bit of knowledge in a lot of areas but Ive never held a full time job due to all the health issues. Dating is a nightmare. On the outside I'm a poor choice for a women who is doing well in life. 

I was doing better. I had made progress with my inner life, and was becoming more social. I had my own apartment, was finishing college up (about time!). Then the virus struck. Now I'm living with family again. Sitting at home on my computer all day. Learning, always learning. I sit here all day just downloading information into my head but I doubt I'll ever use. I'm learning to code a little, i might use that some. But guitar? Audio engineering? I'm never going to have a career in that, or even a hobby. Maybe its all a waste of time the same as video games. We all need an outlet but what happens when we only care about our outlet? When its all we have left. 

I'm going insane. I went from my own appartment to living in one room at my moms house. She is draining to talk to, I can't get a drink from the kitchen without her wanting to dump all her problems on  me. She is deeply toxic, manipuliative, and emotionally draining. I can never let my guard down.

Lockdown sucks for everyone - I'm disabled and live alone, so I really can't go anywhere. I have a couple of good friends who keep in touch &amp; even my ""difficult"" parents have been helpful, which I appreciate, but I am very lonely and have been for some time. Obviously there's not much I can do to improve it while lockdown is in force and Covid stalks the land, but hey-ho.

Anyway, there is someone I have liked for some time. I have done absolutely nothing about it because I'm hardly an ideal candidate for romance &amp; wasn't in the right headspace, but I did make an effort to get to know the person a bit better. We both belong to the same society (which of course isn't happening right now), and I've known him casually for years. Anyway, I emailed him several weeks ago just to say hi (all the members have each other's email addresses so I didn't snoop to find it out!), and asked him how he was doing. He emailed back to say that he was OK, but felt very lonely &amp; worried about the future. I feel pretty much the same, so I emailed him back saying that I was around if he ever felt like a chat, either by email or phone, and gave him my phone number. Very bold move on my part considering that most of the time I do a very convincing hermit crab impression!

Well, clearly it was the wrong thing to do because he didn't reply. And of course he hasn't phoned. Bummer. I feel like a right idiot now. I know that it's completely up to him, and of course I'm not going to make a nuisance of myself, but it's damned painful knowing that someone would rather be lonely &amp; fearful of the future than talk to me.

190,J0Onn,1588099967,1,"When think of the reasons why I don't have friends, this is what I tell myself.

I have immigrated six times, and making friends takes time, a long time.

Also I have some problems, a few physical conditions that arent visible, but that influences my mood and wellbeing a lot.
These will stress me and make me feel tired and uncomfortable while I am around people and will make me want to leave.

Everytime I go to a new place it is very difficult for me to make new friends, even though I try. I allways try to meet people who look like me, like same height and color, and age, but I cant. People don't want to be friends with me.
Some people want to be friends, but they are mostly foreigners, like myself you could say, but not caucasian like I am. 
But I would much rather have friend like myself.
And here is the problem with that.
I happen to have dual citizenship, from two countries with two differentclanguages and cultures, although both european.
This would not be a problem in north america I think, but here, in my country I'm better off acting like im a 'fullblood' to survive. Either that or find others who are dual like myself. And that is the probem. I have never met anyone who where dual citizens like myself. Only two, when I was really young, and I didn't became friends with them. I regret that now. 

Also, I haven't been raised too well, I haven't really learned that much, and been pretty much left to myself to find out how to build a life, without any support or people to talk to or ger advice from whatsoever.

I also think a have a thick psycological shield to protect myself and I act tough sometimes, I think, because of my memories from the past, as a young kid when I had to go places I didnt want to go to.

But today, I am almost fourty, and I look like Im thirty, and I have recently immigrated back to my birth country, to a city, the capital, to work here and live here. 

I managed to find a job, and I tried to go out to bars and meet people, allthough with limitations, due to some physical pain, I got from my last workplace, and also because I'm broke.

That is also a reason I think, why I have and have had a difficult time making friends. Because I have allways poor and I worked and studied since I was twelve around twelve. 
But the place I lived at that time, most people where not as poor as I.

Now, with the lockdown I cant go to bars and its even more difficult to meet people. I try to use obline services lile couchsurfing and go for walks in big parks, but I havent been able to make any friends.

I am trying to fix myself, but I feel what I need to be able to finally fix myself is having a friend, and someone I can have conversations with. 

I am feeling stressed and desperate, I am waiting for and hoping to go back to work and I really want to have friends, or even a friend, around my age

I don‚Äôt know when this all started, but from a young age I had problems dealing with people, as far as I can tell it began at 13 after i began highschool.

this feeling of inadequacy And feeling awkward started to develop at that time, and it cost me several relationships but I still had my core friends who I could rely on,  after my first year of highschool I had to move on to another state and it didn‚Äôt got better, I receive lots of bullying back in school  and I carried that all through highschool feeling anxious all the time and avoiding people in general, some way somehow I‚Äôve got a couple of friends, but.. looking back I was mess up back then, only that I didn‚Äôt knew, I had rage problems, tantrums at a old age, and for those who don‚Äôt know what that looks like I would recommend you to look for adult people doing tantrums, to make things short, my family didn‚Äôt help much, we were kinda poor, and very religious family, and of course you just don‚Äôt go and solve your psychological issues by praying to god, at least for me didn‚Äôt work. 

I don‚Äôt know to what extent my issue  has screwed up my life so far, but I can only see a spiral going downwards, I avoid conversation with most people, I have detached my feelings from others, and I don‚Äôt have any friends, or people outside my family who I can rely on, I can‚Äôt have conversations with women most of the time, it makes me freaking anxious, and I‚Äôm hopeless, and very cynical to be honest, I know I can try and go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist to fix this thing, but there‚Äôs this lack of will to get better, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm numbed down or something, and about the title of the post, yes I‚Äôm starting to feel hatred towards others and even mankind, it‚Äôs like jealousy about their happiness and their wellbeing,  I cannot stand to watch others being happy because it reminds me of my shitty life, and believe when I say, I do not want to think like this, I know that those patterns of thinking never end well, and I don‚Äôt want to end up doing something I might regret, but this anger would not go away, I know very well that  it‚Äôs just random luck to be born in better families or to have better chances at succeeding, and I should try to be grateful, but I cannot bear this intrusive thoughts anymore, it‚Äôs sucking my joy away.",lonely,Feeling hatred towards others,2020-04-29 01:50:58

I‚Äôm sick and tired of the complications there are with trying to make new friends, online or otherwise. 

When we‚Äôre considering making an online friend, it‚Äôs like gambling with our chances whether or not that person might be a catfish or not with malicious intent.

Then there‚Äôs proximity, 
 let‚Äôs just pretend this whole Covid fiasco vanishes after 7 years and you finally found someone you connect with and wanna hang out, but realize that they‚Äôre either a whole continent away or your chances at meeting them in real life is slim to none. 

Then, there‚Äôs the uncertainty with how long you might last with that person if either of you won‚Äôt ghost each other anytime soon.
 
  It‚Äôs not outside the realm of possibility that a person you thought would last, 
might pull a ‚Äú[Who Knew](https://youtu.be/2SKEp-H0Eqs)‚Äù on you, leaving you on your own without warning for days on end.

Due to the flaws of a long distance relationship, you might find yourself heavily reliant on online communication and due to this, 
 your whole relationship with that person might suddenly vanish because of either one of you lost access to your accounts or some external influence not mentioned already.

When I even think about trying to, my brain says that I'd be bothering them and that I shouldn't say anything because they wouldn't like me anyway. People then end up assuming that I don't like anyone and have no interest in talking to them. Even if someone says that they like me I still don't believe them. I can never keep in touch with people and so I lose everyone that I care about. I don't know how to break the cycle. When I finally build up the courage to type out a message it's as if something physically stops me from pressing send. Everyone else seems to have friends and go out to do stuff with them. I have one person I actually go out to meet very rarely. No one else regularly talks to me and I never manage to stay in touch with people once I'm out of our shared setting e.g. school, work etc. It hurts so much, especially lately with people having to stop meeting up. I see people posting pictures where they facetime weekly and I'm just sitting here with no one. I hate this.

Social events, restaurants, bars and cafes are all dead. I hate it. I'm so lonely, it's absolutely crushing. I was forced into a nasty breakup with my girlfriend, someone I thought was perfect, exactly 6 weeks ago, and I've been in quarantine for 5 weeks now. I thought I was doing better, I thought I was healing, but the other day I was working out in the park in the rain and saw a bunch of young happy couples having fun together. It took strength I never imagined I had to not break down and cry. It was almoat like the world was taunting me, reminders everywhere of what I had and now lost.

Slowly, I think I'm losing it. It's becoming so extremely difficult, just sitting here studying all day. I get it I'm a med student but there's only so much studying I can do all day. I tried drowning myself in USMLE prep, but even that is starting to not be enough. And now, I'm starting to see that there's no light at the end of this tunnel. We're stuck like this for the near future, and it's not certain when this will be done.

If we come out of this to a world where dating, socializing and hanging our are dead, then I don't know what to look forward to. Am I supposed to enthusiastically look forward to the bleak, lonely years of residency after med school? My social life is over during those years, and if I can't find a GF that I'm happy with again... Honestly, I'm pretty sure I'll be suicidal. I don't want to be alone.

I wish this nightmare will end soon. I know that when this is done, I'm going to *actively* put myself out there to start dating again.",lonely,"I hate social distancing, it's highlighting my loneliness. Is this supposed to be the ""new normal""?",2020-04-28 18:19:06

We are in quarantine, laziness invades us like hunger and we do not want to do anything (apart from homework or work) things come together, shit comes together and you still feel alone, although you know that everyone is locked in their house, nobody wants to talk to you

That feeling of seeing others wanting, saying on the networks that they want the quarantine to end to see their friends go to parties, but you know that if there is a quarantine or not, you have always been like this alone or sitting in your room wanting to be Someone or you have attention and nobody has done it yet and it was the same process and it's still the same routine getting up doing homework eating bathing and going to bed alone and feeling the same shit again friend I know it's sad

And not only are there people like us and even worse, but we think for a second, is it worth it? It is worth drawing attention. It's worth everyone talking to you. I know you don't want to feel so alone, but people are shit if you don't meet their requirements, they isolate you or, rather, they quarantine you for life.

Recommendation

1.Work on yourself, find a hobbit, something or the shit you like or want to do, but work on it, work on yourself, improve, educate yourself, I know, but you won't lie there just because nobody wants to talk to you somewhere place to fit but get better first

2. My recommendation is to know if people are really worth it, to realize who they are and to try to be friendly, don't expect everyone to talk to you.

249,hamartiated,1588041963,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-28 12:46:03

255,MizoresSnowBunny,1588040252,1,"So, I‚Äôm a guy and I also like guys. I have this friend from work that is one of my best friends right now. I‚Äôve always had a crush on him and I really do love him to death. He‚Äôs the first person in my life that I actually find easy to talk to. I don‚Äôt have to try to make conversation with him, it just happens. 

Very long story short, I got into cutting and I started cutting myself every time that I would feel lonely. One night when he was talking about a girl from work, I got so upset that I was uncontrollably crying and I ended up stabbed myself pretty deep into my stomach. I confided in another friends about it and that friend ended up having a talk with the guy I like about me. 

I ended up taking some initiative and I decided to face my crush head on. I told him that I liked him and that I feel so comfortable around him and all that jazz. He took it very well, he told me that feelings aren‚Äôt always something you can control, he said he was flattered and that he really likes me as a friend and also feels comfortable with me. We talked for like 3 hours and he confided a bunch of personal stuff in me and I did the same with him. He‚Äôs not into guys so, he didn‚Äôt reciprocate those feelings but after this talk that we had, I felt okay with the fact that he was just a really good friend. In fact, I felt super selfish for putting that at risk because I couldn‚Äôt keep my feelings in check.

For the next day or two, I felt better. I did feel more platonically towards him and I was somewhat complacent with him not reciprocating. But that was only temporary. I started getting those feelings again for him and they came back stronger than ever. I was already really depressed and suicidal before all of this happened (I have a lot of other problems). I‚Äôve talked to friends, my therapist, and my psychiatrist and they tell me what‚Äôs wrong, but they don‚Äôt really give me a whole lotta advice about what I could do. I‚Äôve had really strong urges to cut again, but I haven‚Äôt just yet. I have a lot of scars on my body and I‚Äôm trying not to make more but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep it together.

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm asking for. I guess I just want some advice or some help about what I could/should do. I‚Äôve been told that I should just distance myself from him as much as possible but I can‚Äôt do that. He‚Äôs such a good friend, he‚Äôs one of the only people that makes me feel even the slightest bit of happiness, and I‚Äôm not gonna throw out this friendship because I can‚Äôt keep my feelings in check. I‚Äôve also been told to find a new guy to like or get out there and find someone else, but that hasn‚Äôt been going great. Everything‚Äôs closed because of the whole virus thing, and I did shamefully download Tinder because I have some friends who are in successful relationships from there and it didn‚Äôt work out. I actually got 6 matches over the span of the two weeks and all 6 of them said that they didn‚Äôt mean to swipe right on me, and one of them even called me a ‚Äústupid mistake‚Äù. So that was great. I‚Äôm also no spring chicken and I live in a pretty conservative area....so my options are limited.

I‚Äôm just so lonely, I‚Äôve never known anyone to have feelings for me, which is fine but I just feel like I have a whole lot to give and no one seems to want it.

Anyway I‚Äôm sorry for all of this and I guess I‚Äôm just desperate for some help. I don‚Äôt like asking the few friends I have because I feel like I‚Äôm putting my own burdens onto them and that I‚Äôm more of a liability for them than a friend. Idk, I‚Äôm sorry for all of this and I do appreciate any support. I know that at the end of the day, it‚Äôs just some stupid guy having a crush on someone who doesn‚Äôt like him back and he wants to kill himself because of it, which seems super petty and middle school-like but that‚Äôs just how it is.

I hope everyones doing okay, I'm sending you all hugs and love.

I've got a solution to loneliness. It works, I've tried it. I'm looking for a coder who has an entrepreneurial spirit to help me solve the major issue of loneliness in America and abroad.

I was once incredibly lonely. It started when I broke up with my girlfriend and my best friend moved out of state. I threw myself into studying for a grad school test in my free time, which only made it worse as I ended up self-isolating for 2 years. I became terribly depressed, a shell of myself. Then I figured out how to solve the issue, through actually experiencing the solution myself.

I won't go into detail here. But if there are any coders out there who want to spend their time helping me solve this problem then DM me. The app MVP would not be difficult to build (very simple) and I've already got a business plan, marketing plan, and a sales plan in place, I need someone to code it and I want someone with the passion for change and improvement, someone who has felt the pain I've felt and wants to make sure we can reduce that pain in others. I could pay a couple grand for freelance folks to make it but it won't be the same. I know you're out there, DM me and lets nip this thing in the bud.

So i told her to look up the story and told her were i was. Well it was late and she was already asleep.

In the morning she just responded with a simple lol. Didnt bother me cause we often respond just with a lol. But after that she straight up didnt answer me the whole time. Just ignored everything so suddenly.

Everytime i saw this fucking message pop up thingy i was so happy. The reason i was always happy when we spoke is that we share lots of similar traits, things we encountered and things we both struggle. After she didnt respond anymore i just became sad and angry. I tried to shrugg it off and thought Well she isnt worth it, there are many more out there. But it didnt work (it still doesnt).

And there i lay in my bed and think what couldve been. But then my dog comes to me and i nearly cry. (My Dog not the girl btw) She chears me up everytime im sad or upset. Sometimes she just does the most stupid things but i love it. She brings me joy and happieness again. But this whole in me it is still there

Just wanted to write this somewhere down. Hope some of you know what i mean.

282,beanbeandoedoe,1588024590,2,"I've had a constant struggle throughout my life to maintain close, connected relationships. I feel that it stems from a combination of inner shame, anxiety, and a history of betrayal. I have some people I talk to a little bit once in a while, but it feels like I'm always the person to talk to when someone has ABSOLUTELY nothing else to do. If I tried to be better friends, I'm afraid of coming off as desperate, or I'm ashamed of myself and my personality and that they may leave me or distance themselves when they see more of me. It doesn't help that that's literally what has happened to me, from elementary school to middle school to high school. There's never been a sense of stability within any of the friendships or relationships I have. It's like people treat me as a rental and then when the times up, they just leave. It feels like I'm just some secondhand piece of clothing, sitting in a thrift store, waiting for someone to pick me up just to dispose of me a little bit later, back to where I was before.",lonely,When you can't keep close friends,2020-04-28 07:56:30

288,discusser1,1588022120,3,"a few months ago we ""friend broke up"" with a woman who i considered a friend (and also supported  a bit although she was more lazy than unlucky). when i heard the term toxic friend a long time ago i thought about her immediatelly. i did put up with many things until i didnt and the friendship started to die out, i was always initiating until i stopped.

i sometimes miss her but not in a case of a deep emotion, just when i see a thing that we would have laughed at etc.

i was searching for an old email recently and her message came up because it accidentally contained the word i was searching. WOW. it was about 5 years old and i COMPLETELY forgot about that situation, can you believe it. i knew she was sometimes evil, and she stopped talking to me for about 2 years because she disliked something i did etc., but i still cannot believe i forgot this horrible time: i told her i was unhappy she had no time for me and kept cancelling and postponing our planned events or not replying for days (in fact it was because she had a short term relationship and did the classic cliche of ditching a friend because she had someone for sex). she wrote me SUCH a horrible email, disguised as a way to try to find a solution but in fact being so evil, aggressive, and belittling my emotions and accusing me of whatnot, stating she does not have to apologize, that she had no idea i felt that way, that she does not know hor to react to hurt remorses  and that she did not have the ""strength"" to reply to an invitation (strength... i only asked if she was free on friday! - and later i said i was sad when i repeatedly offered several variants to meet and did not receive a reply, and this thing happened many times again). she tried to made me look like a weirdo that is super needy - and i took care to only state facts (""you postponed - you did not reply"" or my emotions (""made me sad"", ""i am unhappy to be the only one initiating anything""). she repeated how unpleasant it is for her and that our friendship lacked freedom and spontaneity. (spontaneity meaning there are no rules for things like replying to messages or actually seeing each other) - does it mean she wants no reponsibility? i guess so. funnily she repeated she had no idea that i felt like i was initiating all the time but it was exactly what she did, and she continued doing it. she miraculously found time and ""strength"" when i wrot ei had a gift voucher for an expensive restaurant lated on, haha

i couldnt believe i allowed her evil outburst to happen without any good reply, and instead of replying something like ""this is too much, i do not want to be treated this way"" i actually invited her for a foreign trip later on (!!!). WOW. i thought i was an adult. this was such a revelation. i hope this never happens again and i would not wish that treatment upon anyone. i knew i had allowed another friend to treat me unevenly when i was a teen but i am an adult. how did that happen? not sure - but i sure hope the future will be better. 

edited to add - she has no other friends, all left her, some wothout explanation, some said they were unable to put up with this or that. i was the last one which says a lot

thank you search function in email",lonely,so much better without a toxic friend,2020-04-28 07:15:20

All my life I've kept these thoughts bottled up to myself and haven't told anyone about it, not even my family. I just can't feel comfortable, not even with the people I care about because I just feel that I don't belong, like I don't have a place in this world and I'm just a nuisance to everyone I know, and this only just makes the situation worse. I guess I'm just one of those people who are so quick to judge and make assumptions on what others may think of me even though a lot of the time, it's just my mind playing tricks on me.......or maybe I'm just a coward :P

So yesterday I took it upon myself to browse the internet for answers as to why this is, and it wasn't until I stumbled upon this community that I realised that there are people who are just like me: lost, insecure, unsure of what their place is in life and what others may think of them. I spent about an hour last night just sitting alone in a dark room on this subreddit. I felt as though I was finally in a place of comfort, a place to escape all these personal problems I've been dealing with all my life and just vent to people who may be dealing with similar situations and can actually understand where I'm coming from and I just wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart for being some of the most welcoming people I've ever not known.....thank you so fucking much &lt;3

My jealousy applies everywhere, whether its somebody I just meant, someone I've been friends with for months, or somebody I'm dating (although I haven't dated anyone or been in a actual relationship in my entire life)  


I've always had bad issues with loneliness and making friends. I've been desperate to the point where I try to force myself to make friends on subreddits for such things, like r/needafriend.When somebody always tells me ""I did this with my friend...."" or... ""a friend of mine"" or anything that mentions them having *any* friendships or relationships with other people, my heart immediately sinks. I've had a good friend on the internet I've known for months mention a good friend they had, and I felt extreme anxiety and like crying my eyes out. One time I saw they were spending time together playing the same game and I began crying. I ran to the bathroom and impulsively cut myself, thinking I wasn't good enough or they'd replace me.  


Even if it's somebody I just met on the internet and we've only talked 1 or 2 times, if they mention any friends of theirs I get extreme jealousy and feel like never talking to them again.

363,hamartiated,1587955402,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

So basically when I was only 14 years old I had a crush on my classmate who I never really talked to at that time. I knew that I was way too young for relationship so I just decided to live on with hope that the feeling will fade away. Obviously I was wrong and the feeling was as strong as at the beggining, she was actually very friendly towards me even though she hardly ever talked to me. There was aleays something unusual in her behaviour whenever she was speaking to me. 

Near the end of last year of secondary school there was a prom-like thing, obviously I didn't have enough balls to ask my crush to be my partner, so asigned a partner for me and I had to dance with someone I didn't know. I was painfully envious whenever I saw my crush with some random dude who was one year younger and twice as tall as me, but she never really talked to that guy after the prom thing. After that thing there was a party with a catering, disco and other types of shit, I didn't really want to be there cause I can't dance and I'm not really into most of modern music, so I just sat with my friends. Suddenly SHE comes up to us and wants to encourage us to go to the disco-thing, but we didn't want and then she grabs my hand and forces me to go with her, pretty cool right? I finally got a chance to spend some time with her, so what do I do? I fucking panic and go back to my friends. I couldn't find her till the end of that night and it made me feel like shit. About two days later I asked a mutual friend for my crush's phone number. I wanted to apologise for running away like an idiot, she said that she didn't mind it and she also didn't want to be at that party. We got to know each other pretty well and we were texting each other almost every day for about three years even we weren't even classmates anymore shortly after we started talking to each other. At some point she stopped texting back but she kept liking and commenting stuff I posted on Instagram (I was basically posting on IG only because she was interacting with me). 

And that's where we have reached the current year. About a week before the quarantine started I was on a suburban train with a friend of mine, coming back from school like every other day. Suddenly I see my crush waiting for the door open, I started to panic, looked away from her, talked to my friend just to look busy. I unitentionally turned out to look like I wasn't iterested in talking to her, but in reality I missed her so much and really wanted to talk to her again. She entered the train, stopped next to me, said hi, I responded, she smiled and went further to sit down. I was considering if I should go up to her and talk to her for a while but I felt like I would just be bothering her, I didn't manage to make up my mind and the train has reached my stop so I just went home. The next day she texted me and I was hoping that we would have our daily conversitions again, but we only chatted for a while and she never texted me again. 

Asking for her number and getting attached to her was probably the worst mistake I've made in my life so far. I will never know why she stopped talking to me, we were always so friendly to each other",lonely,I basically made a huge f***ing mistake,2020-04-27 12:04:02

All i want is a girlfriend! I admit im a little shy, but damn, i even started learning about psychology just to try to ""comprehend"" why...

I was never interested on those situations where you just have fun with someones body and never meeting that person again, thats like a sex doll and my friends seem to be really into it, but im not, i just want to love someone, spend time with her, have a relationship but that seems impossible.

384,electrahedra,1587944762,1,"I was diagnosed with depression a few months ago. It was quite bad, I experienced hallucinations and suicidal ideation. I am currently a student in my first year.

I am now medicated. Mirtazapine, moderate dose. My mood is still always low but at least I am able to focus. I have worked like a machine the past few days and there is no end in sight, at this rate I will have covered 6 months of uni material in 3 weeks. As for side effects, vivid, feverish dreams and mild dysgraphia. If you are severely depressed, take whatever the doctor offers you, it isn't worth waiting.

I am back ""home"" now, no reason to be on campus right now. I have alienated myself from the locals, of course my behaviour was weird. I was depressed out of my mind and could not get treatment. I was very quiet and how I talked to people was weird. I feel lonely I think. But I am so changeable. Sometimes I feel like I need no one. I have two friends, only one I have met. 

I have not had an intimate relationship. I can not tell how that could happen. I guess I am ""supposed"" to make the first move, that is the dynamic now and always. But now I am out of school, there is no way I am forced around anyone. I am sexually attracted to both genders I think. Very few males though. But as I said before, I am changeable in what I want. I wish I could explain better. I do not think I am ugly, I would say I am average looking. But I feel constantly that people hate me, they are looking for some reason and they have probably found it. And it is having a sustained effort, do I want them just for sex? But then again, I feel alone and it would be nice to have someone my age to hug. Inagine that. It is almost unimaginable, yet other people manage it. If you are a girl it is easy. Unless you are freakishly ugly it is easy to get 90% of guys as your botfriend. I can not explain what I think easily.

I think I want to somehow find a girlfriend. But they do not like weird boys. They like boys who listen to rap and have their hair cut short on the sides. They all want normal. I am not like that and I can not be. I feel hatred for them that they are all so normal. And the way they are sucked into narcissism. And maybe my parents is part of this. All of my early memories are of my mother shouting at my father. And my father would just take it. And there was never any physical abuse, between anyone in the household, it was always just my mother screeching and whining. She is depressed as well. And a hoarder, she is delusional. She claims to clean the entire house properly but just cleans the bathroom. I offer to help but there is always deflection, excuse, complaining, it is my fathers fault. He left the house 3 years ago and we still see each otger every so often. There is nothing to talk about. With either of my parents. They could have taken some interest. I read and read. But they never asked me about it, or looked into what I should read. Lots of books, but again and again, pop sci. Shite. Absolute shite. They havent taken any interest in me beyond the absolute minimum. I mostly just ignore them now. I am a horrible son. They raised me, it is their fault.

I just want to find one that is not normal in the way I am, I dont mean mental illness, I do not know what I mean, but it is not that. ""Be yourself"" myself is certainly not worth being around, unmedicated anyway. I feel alone. I am unhappy always. Would my gp increase the dose if I told them that. I cant tell. I might have to tell them, problem is they are near my uni, I do not know if they would change increase my medication without seeing me in person. I also worry they might change it to a different drug that does not work at all.

So what. I am going to have to wait until my mid twenties when they want someone in a well paying job. That is the dynamic. LOOK AT WHAT HAS FUCKING HAPPENED . Or I guess it was always this way. Even before porn and instagram and tinder.

Hatred is what I feel the more I think about this. I started writing this feeling normal and now I feel hatred again. I cried for a while.

Am I even lucid. Can I tell what are mentally ill outpourings and what I think. I dont know who I am. Be yourself, am I hateful or do I care. I cant tell and it wont sit still. Somebody could have just been kind to me in seondary, sixth form. No, that only happens if you are good looking. And now I am ill probably forever. Forever can this go on for the 60 or 70 or 80 years I might live, that is a long time, a long time to decay physically.

I don't wanna move to another country because it's so hard and risky and I'm better off here. But I can't stay here because it's so bland and familiar. The list goes on. 

I want to kill myself. I just don't want the aftermath that will happen. The *very* few people that care about me will be disappointed. I suffer every day by being alive just so other people aren't upset. That's if they actually care. I just wish I could freeze time and not let the future happen. Or just go back in time and make it so I was never born. I contemplate every day just killing everybody I love and then myself, just so nobody has to suffer. That probably sounds so selfish. I could never do it though. Unless they all just forgot about me or admitted they hate me. Then I could die. God I wish that could happen.

I can't remember what it feels like to be happy. I laugh every now and then, but that feeling never lasts. I feel joy sometimes, but I never feel alive. There isn't a day of my life that I would repeat.

What do I do? I can't go to therapy. People would judge me. The therapist would hate me or find me boring. I'm awkward and uninteresting. None of my friends like me. I'm not sure how much I like them. I just have nowhere else to go. I just live in fear that people just have to put up with me, and nobody really wants me around or enjoys spending time with me.

For example, in grade 7. Girl I had a huge crush on and 2 of my other friends, go to her house every day after school. (Keep in mind, I am the one still walking behind them al so they can walk side by side on the path) whatever I just want everyone to have a good time and don‚Äôt wanna because a fuss for something tiny because they‚Äôll playfully tease and make fun of me for being sensitive... i figure i‚Äôm a teenager going through puberty. I‚Äôm probably just being fussy. Anyway, a very rainy day comes round and thankfully her mother was there to pick us all up and take us back to her house. As everyone starts hopping in I look around and ask ‚Äúwhere can I sit?‚Äù... i get a soft, ‚Äúoh sorry there isn‚Äôt anymore room‚Äù and the door shuts and off they go... yeah. I walked home I. The rain by myself. This was one that scarred me the most but you kinda of get the gist.

Shit like this has been going on in my life for nearly a decade now. I‚Äôm been removed from events without reason and am expected to act like nothing happened. I‚Äôm expected to take all this and act like nothings wrong. 

Clearly this has really affected my self esteem and confidence which I am happy to say is coming back slowly but surely. However it‚Äôs really affected my ability to meet women. 

i‚Äôm shy, anxious, always worried I might make the girl uncomfortable, and because of this I watch all these girls that i‚Äôve bonded with and have feelings for, walk off with my friends. 
 
I just feel like i‚Äôm putting so much effort into being a good, decent human being... and i‚Äôm just being dragged through the mud, spit on, and shunned. 

I just want that feeling of being loved by someone that isn‚Äôt a family member or pet.

I do know tomorrow I am going to the beach with my new group of friends, but for some reason, the loneliness doesn't disappear. 

I am in a couple of groups, but I feel I'm the sorethumb in most of the group. This has never happen with people i know back in my country. I have some close friends from highschool, from my hobby, and I feel like I'm an extrovert and social in there. But here, I always feel like ""that person"" that people never be wanna friends with, the one that got bullied, ridiculed, just there as a plaything or because they feel sorry, but still doesn't want to be close, just to not be the antagonist. It might not be true, but it's always feels like that. Weirdly even with people that also an international students and from the same country and city as me. 

Is just weird, everytime I'm here, i always feel lonely. I live with my relatives here, interact with them, chatted with friends, yet still lonely. It's not just the pandemic thing, this has been my feelings for the last 4 years I'm in perth.

406,dangerouspeyote,1587927289,1,"Backstory.  (The TLDR is basically the title).  I married the first girl that ever showed me the time of day. She turned out to be emotionally abusive and destroyed my already low self confidence and sense of self worth. 

6 years ago I managed to get myself out and get divorced.  But, I‚Äôve been single ever since.   I‚Äôm 100% alone.  I live alone, no pets.    I haven‚Äôt touched another living thing in 6 weeks.  

I try the online dating thing pretty often, but, I get ghosted, a lot.  Just happened again after about two days. This one really hurt as I thought there was a real connection this time.  

I‚Äôm really hurt at the situation. But i find myself feeling angry and bitter. I‚Äôm angry at the women who have treated me poorly. I‚Äôm angry at my friends who have what I want.   I just want to scream every time my sister sends me a photo of her family having a wonderful picnic with their dog.    

This clearly isn‚Äôt a healthy way to deal with these emotions.  I don‚Äôt want to lash out at my family and friends.   I don‚Äôt want to feel this horrible jealousy for everyone who has someone.

408,chiyukiame0101,1587923644,1,"It's been another one of those Sundays spent feeling down and anxious and out of it, letting the hours run away from me even though I have so much to do. I woke up late after having bad dreams and spent the day feeling suspended and in between, neither here nor there, wasting away the hours on the internet.  

I told my therapist about how I often stay online for hours before bed, depriving myself of sleep, just to feel some connection or numb myself out. She asked if I could try and stick to a schedule. I'm not sure how well that's working out since it's almost 2am, I haven't showered, and I need to be up early for work tomorrow which I'm not prepared for at all. 

But there's a moment of peace that comes over you when you're finally, *finally* too tired to keep scrolling. When your eyes can't stand the glare from another video, when even your addicted brain protests and stops you from refreshing the page another time. 

I dragged my too tired body up from bed and thought, suddenly, about how nice it would be to have a hot meal now. Japanese curry was what came to mind - simple and comforting. I haven't had a hug in ages and don't expect to get one anymore. It's painful even to think about. But a warm meal - that I can fantasize about and still smile. I really wouldn't deserve it, given how I've been living. But that would make it all the more meaningful for me.  

In reality, I'm here eating a can of cold tuna with some leftover rice. But I'm not here to complain. In these hard times, I'm grateful for what I have. But I think I'll still go to bed tonight dreaming, and in my dreams, I hope to share that warm meal with any one of you who is reading this. A little bit of comfort and reassurance for everyone who needs it, especially those who feel they don't deserve it.

411,SwoleAndLone,1587921381,1,"Hey,
I'm a 17 year old male from Austria and there is only one thing that bothers me in my life. I am lonely.

I really am not trying to sound arrogant with this, but im actually a very handsome and 'swole' young man. I have a good body from working out in the gym and very handsome. Mostly because i am eating a nutrient dense diet (e.g raw milk, high quality animal products), i also get many compliments regarding my looks.
 Unfortunately, although these looks i worked hard for, i dont have any real friends. I do of course  have friends in school and beyond that and go and hang outside with them together, but they're not good friends so to speak. Every thing we do comes from my side, i ask them to go out or do something together. Its never the other way around.
 As you can tell i also don't have a girlfriend, although im heavily into searching one. Funny thing is when people meet me they think im a 'player"" and actually (no troll) get very surprised when i tell them i dont have any girlfriend and am still a virgin.
Although many girls started approaching me, it never really went further than one meet-up. What makes this all SO much worse is, that i am an incredibely extroverted person meaning i love socialising with anyone, literally. 
 It really bothers me, somedays i just dont understand it. I've put lots of work into who i am today but it doesnt get me what i want. One day me and my friend were in the gym and once he saw my body full pumped up, he literally said he would expect a incredibely hot girl by my side, judging by the way i look.
What im trying to say is, does anyone feel the same or better to say has the same problem? What should i do, sometimes i think to my self how wasted potential i am. Again, not trying to seem arrogant.

429,Koshien83,1587896948,1,"The backstory: I had a most unpleasant experience in school after being suddenly transferred in the middle of 3rd grade from a Montessori to my local elementary + middle school (basically parents run out of money for that school). It was sudden, a very different environment, and I never blend in. In the meanwhile my abusive family turned to the worst (alcoholic borderline mother + violent narcissist father) and I had not only no-one to turn to at home (relatives in a different city, my father had no friends and isolated my mother, my sibling was younger) but also I was in ""no mood"" to be happy and socialise freely like kids do. I had a few friends in the previous school but at that age if the parents aren't in contact you easily lose them.

It doesn't help that I didn't attend the religious classes they all did, I wasn't even baptised, and my parents were not married (back then and there, it was jaw-dropping). And I was socially clueless, a blank slate. I went away at 16, moving to a big city. I even got baptised to blend in, a choice I deeply regret (never believed, and kids in the big city didn't either so I was weird for being religious, in a sad reversal). By that time the damage was done, I didn't even try to socialise, so I attracted a few mockery and taunting from a few classmates and was obviously isolated, but it was only 3 years. However the heavy abuse happened in that small city, and I was hounded and pursued to be terrified, mocked, taunted, humiliated, even chased in the streets, I was a hot commodity for bullies. And everyone else ignored me. When I said the final goodbye to my classmates at 16, no one answered back ""goodbye"".

What guts me is that I was so unworthy that they never made an attempt to hunt me down in the big city, because then I can't understand why they ""wanted me so much"" back then. What was I to them? Not even worthy of being their target? Much later in life I ended up in a toxic scholarly environment, tried to endure it to reverse my past and make it, but when I walked away the same situation happened: they immediately forgot that I even existed, surprisingly respected my choice to quit that path, and were chill with my calling it quit. It hurt tremendously. Not even worth it.

I am so lonely that I really ""want"" to run into those bullies online, even after 20 years. I begrudge toxic people for letting me go. It's messed up. But really, is there even a single person who is willing to look for me, find me, and fight to keep me... without toxic intents?

I‚Äôve been accustomed for so long not to care for people‚Äôs names anymore that I didn‚Äôt remembered hers... it was awful and I felt like shit... she was hurt by it but eventually didn‚Äôt hold it accountable since we hung out some more after that... I got to know her more and more... and the next time we hung out was when I found her alone in a concert by total coincidence; I was there with my brother; I asked her who she was there with; she said herself (at that point I was amazed about how open she was with it; I would‚Äôve never admitted that yet alone even been there by myself) so I grabbed her hand and took her to the front stage where my brother and his friends were.. we had a great time and I kissed her on the check goodnight and asked if I was gonna see her again she said yes... from there time passed by without communication until a special exhibit was opening up for October for Halloween... I invited her to go see it and she said yes... so we met up there and had a blast mostly in the gift shop lol... we the night ended she was talking about going to a bar; that‚Äôs when I decided to give her a bouquet of flowers that I made with her and a special card that matched the exhibits art I wrote something sweet to her on the card... that‚Äôs when I saw her starting to push away.. she quickly retracted her bar invitation and said she had to go to work tomorrow.. I wasn‚Äôt doubting her nor was I upset with her I understood work life plus I had to work earlier than her and I said it was ok... she later texted me saying that she should have went and that‚Äôs she‚Äôs sorry... and I said not to worry about it that I had to work too.. valentines comes and I decide to make a floral arrangement for her... I make this beautiful piece with a beautiful vase and I take it to her house... she‚Äôs super excited but once she sees the arrangement I saw that her expression changed; she said she liked it and that nobody has ever done that for her and thanked me; later she texted me and said that she gave it to her brother in law to give to her sister cause he‚Äôs cheap and needed a gift... that low key hurt but told her well I guess I just got to beat ur brother in law‚Äôs arrangement for ur birthday... she laughed and said u better not
Time passed by and it was about to be her birthday... I had to compete in a floral competition for my work and needed someone to model a purse I was making so I asked for her help.. she agreed to help and we went to the mall to shop for a purse. We had a blast laughing looking talking... the competition day came and she was stunned about how the purse turned out... after the competition I gave her the purse for her birthday which was next week and I also won a flower bouquet they were auctioning off that she fell in love with for her... lol that night she was filled with flowers and she looked lovely with a big old smile on her... we went to go eat after that and drove her home...
The quarantine hit right before her birthday and I took the liberty to go get her a specially made vegan cake since she couldn‚Äôt go out and celebrate; oh! Also got her a signed weeknd cd since that‚Äôs her favorite artist... I took it to her house and said I hope it wasn‚Äôt too much like the flowers... she chuckled and said no and that it means a lot to her... I let be there since she was with her family and my brother was nagging me on my end... a couple weeks go by and now we are in today... I would‚Äôve checked in on her every now and then to see how she was doing; told her I got another job since we both lost ours and if she needs help with anything including bills to hit me up... I know she never will she‚Äôs too strong of a person too but I‚Äôd rather she did then drown in this issue... honestly I didn‚Äôt even need the job I had enough saving to last me a couple months for my finances.. just got the extra gig mostly to have it as a back up in case she does need help at the end... she understandably gets bored over quarantine and makes social media accounts... me being my anti social self starts learning over her... I see that she‚Äôs hanging out with a couple people going hiking and stuff didn‚Äôt really bothered me until I invited her to go hiking and she said no... I was ok the first time; maybe she‚Äôs busy.. later I invited her to go get some food and we‚Äôll eat it in the park like a picnic... she said she‚Äôll think about it and eventually said no... I asked her a couple more times and she said no; I eventually felt like I was bugging and asked if I was? And if she just didn‚Äôt want to hangout with me anymore? She said no it‚Äôs just bad time cause of the virus and she didn‚Äôt want to get infected; which got me questioning then y was she hanging out with other people; but played it off and said yeah I understand I mean I am working at a factory with a bunch of people around me...
Two nights ago; I had the night off so I decided to stay up all night texting her to get to know her deeper thoughts and her past a little more... I was drinking she wasn‚Äôt... it was going all fine; even tho she didn‚Äôt want to open up much she said she needed to drink fro that lol I understood and didn‚Äôt push her... then my drunk self started flirting with her; she was laughing throughout it... then for some reason I decided to lurk on her twitter; and she posted something about me; she posted that she didn‚Äôt understand y some guys try to do everything they can to win her heart and that she just wasn‚Äôt for them... I was upset and called her out on it... she was confused cause I went from straight cheesing to upset... then I sent her the screen shot... it turned to a little argument (pointed out that she wasn‚Äôt trying to lead me on and she never asked for the gifts and that I don‚Äôt know how to approach crushes I had) but the argument wasn‚Äôt nothing big at the end i made her laugh and said goodnight... I apologized the next day for how my drunk self behaved and she said no hard feelings... yesterday I told her to block me and ghost me; that I know she wasn‚Äôt trying to lead me on and the gifts I gave her weren‚Äôt a way to win her over but to make special days have special meanings; that I don‚Äôt think we can be friends I don‚Äôt have a single friend and knowing myself I won‚Äôt stop chasing u if u don‚Äôt block me and ghost me... today I texted her; late but to see if she blocked me; she didn‚Äôt.. my text went through but no response... I asked her y? No response... so I just texted goodnight guerrita... and a gif of a bear covering another bear in the sheets saying goodnight...

I usually struggle to make friends as I don't think I am interesting enough to hold people's attention and I constantly feel like they will get bored and leave. I started my first year in college last year and basically spent the whole year eating lunch in some random hidden corners and rushing home the first chance I got. I would sometimes skip class just to go home as I couldn't stand to be there another moment.
Then this year(second year) everything changed. I met a bunch of people who seemed to like me and I thought finally things are going to change. I especially met this one guy who seemed to ""get"" me. We had the same tastes, had most of our classes together. It was fun hanging out with him in general. He always treated me very nicely and did things I genuinely never expected someone would ever do for me. He is the first boy ever to give me any attention and I developed a crush on him (pathetic I know). I already knew that he wouldn't like me back that way and decided to tell him just so I would get some closure. So I ended up telling him and he said no. I didn't realise how deeply I felt for him until it ended up hurting like hell. I was terrified that he would stop wanting to hang out with me and very nearly begged him to stay friends. He is actually a very nice person and didn't react how I expected him to. He said he wanted to stay friends and didn't really think my confession affected our friendship in any way. Him being this nice to me all the time just made me fall harder for him. He became the sole reason for me to enjoy college. I loved attending classes only because he would be there. If I found he wasn't going to come that day, I wouldn't feel like going either. I kept trying to find reasons to text him to the point where I would make up stories just so I would have a reason to talk to him. My happiness started to depend only on him. One word from him would end up making my day.  Now, due to the lockdown being stuck at home has made me more lonlier than ever. I know he is busy and has his own stuff to do but I still keep finding reasons to text him and talk to him. I've made up so many lies just so he would give me some attention. I feel terrible day by day for doing this but I can't seem to stop. I've tried deleting his phone number and all our texts multiple times but just can't stop wanting his attention. I feel pathetic and oh so stupid for letting someone have this much power over my happiness. I know it's not fair to him also. He probably thinks of me only as a friend and I am ruining everything by acting this way. I don't know what to do anymore.

My life changed in a tragic series of events, to give you some reference I was later diagnosed with chronic ptsd over these events. I could no longer handle confrontation, not at all. It brought me back to a terrible feeling. That part of me had disappeared, but no-one was there to appreciate it, instead I had a girlfriend who exploited it to be pointlessly cruel. She understood my condition and still struck at it in order to get away with saying things you would leave someone over. I let it happen over and over again, I couldn't fight back when it was happening and I would rather disappear for weeks rather than have to mention it afterward. It caused days of panic attacks, shaking and trembling, loss of sleep, nightmares. I can't explain how bad it is to someone who doesn't have that level of anxiety, but take a very unpleasant fear and imagine living in that feeling for very long amounts of time. Never breathing right, never resting, trying not to do all the things you do when you're scared.

I remembered how I learned to fight, because my Mother was abusive. She started fights every day with someone in my family and then blamed them for her own participation. The tragic event I referred to happened in a relationship, where for half a year I just allowed screaming rage, physical abuse, psychotic ranting to go on while I remained patient and caring. But that didn't work. I stood up for myself, but it didn't fix the root problem - my ex was mentally ill and abusive. So it didn't stop, and I needed to not only keep doing it, but to escalate it to keep up with her. I had to try and be a best friend, a warm presence, and ready to fight every day at a moment's notice. It caught up with me very badly and changed me in a permanent way. 

I kept thinking that I needed peace, when I think now that the healing process means I wouldn't need peace. I would be able to stand up for myself again. I'm not quite there yet. But I feel that I can now speak up for myself.

I've felt happiness since then, I haven't been robbed of everything. it's been fun. But I am profoundly lonely, trying to figure out basic skills I already had and second guessing who I am as my looks fade and my life carries out without regard for how I feel.

So it seems like the only time I come to credit is when I feeling like outer trash. In the last 48 hours have been rough and before that as well but it was minor before then.

Ok so for the past three weeks or so I have been refusing to eat much, just what I need to survive. I would skip breakfast sometimes. I don't know why I am doing this. But I am a very skinny person. I am often compared to a twig by people who claim to be my friends

These people that claim to be my friends have also been ignoring me for the past two weeks. They would not respond to any of my messages. I don't spam them or anything. One day I would ask them how is their day going after maybe two days without a response I would try sending a meme then after no response after a further two days I would try something else.

My former best friend thinks that I am annoying and that's all I am. I don't have a personality beyond that. But I wouldn't deny I am annoying in school most of the time but that's the role that I was given by my peers. The annoying, dumb kid. I just want to be accepted so that's why I don't dispute the role. I am not the most social person.

So that's the basically the few that I think of friends I have mighty low standards in that department. I am regularly called stupid by many in classes constantly, also I am not the most healthy person. It seems I have gotten all the bad genes in the family I have serval health conditions but as a result, I am always tired and pushing myself to attend all my classes. In the past year, I have only missed 10 classes at most. Consider that from 30 classes that I missed in the previous year. But sometimes it's too much for me and I fall asleep in the middle of the classes, I am normally at the back so I don't disturb the class. But a teacher has started picking on me as a result of this and he encourages the jokes that students make about it. I am not okay with this but I can't do anything, this particular teacher is a dean so I can't make any reports against him and he is generally well-liked by the rest of the class.

But school is its own problem just needed to get that one off my chest that's not my current issue, as it no school as we all are in lockdown.

Ok so my current issue, as you can surmise I am lonely and have no one to talk to, the one person that could talk to me and not see an annoying, stupid person is currently vex with me because as they put it I am to damage. I don't know what to think if that is what the only person that was okay with me thinks about me.

My family is better that I had none, I have a sister she doesn't have my interest in mind unless she can use me. I literally will do anything that I can to help her. She is more boyish in nature than me. So when she wants someone to exercise with I am there, when she wants someone to talk to I am there. But when I need someone she is never there and could care less.

My mom isn't any better, she is always on her phone or sleeping but when she isn't she is with my sister or stepdad. Lately, my sister and mom have taken to watching movies together but I can't go with them because my stepdad is there. Also when I asked my mom to do the same thing with me a while back she was to busy and didn't have time for my non-sense.

My stepdad doesn't like me at all. He hates my guts and everything that I do is a problem for him and he constantly complains about me to my mom. Who gets mad at me for being me.

Today I finally caved in and cried because it was all too much for me, well I didn't exactly cry I shredded a tear a single tear, I have become distant from my emotions and cant properly connect with them. So in all, I am feeling lonely and I have no one to talk to.

Hi, basically lately I have been getting worse and worse and it feels like I‚Äôm just getting nowhere, people say go and tell someone but that really does not help one bit especially when you tell someone who you think cares about you and they just ignore you, from the little friends that I actually have it seems like hardly any of them even want to talk to me not even a good morning, good night, not even a hello. It‚Äôs always me who initiates a conversation and it‚Äôs always so one sided as if the other person isn‚Äôt interested at first when I met my friends they where so nice we could actually have a good conversation but I guess as I got more boring they lost interest and no longer want to talk with me, I have brought this up and I just get hit with no no and then some sort of excuse which is most likely just a lie to make me not feel bad. It makes me feel so lonely and sad that my so called friends will happily come to me when they have problems expecting me to help and I do but then when I need a little bit of help and support I get nothing I get ignored and that just makes me feel worse.

My 20th birthday my best friend of 14 years ditched me to be with her boyfriend.

When I was moving to a different state, a friend of 2 years said he was going to see me off but he never came.

It hurts because I get ready to go and then I'm left waiting for them to call/text telling me they're here/outside. I text them and then they ignore me or say they forgot about me.",lonely,What is the point of having friends if they forget about you all the time.,2020-04-26 12:52:31
468,my_throw_awayyy,1587869391,1,"I post here sometimes. I am a 21 year old that has never dated a girl all through out middle school, high school, and now college. I'm a pretty introverted and calm guy. There have been a few girls that were interested in me but they were not my type after i got to know them better. So everyday, i have the same thoughts running in my head , ""I wish i was dating right now"" ""I want (insert girl's name here) to be my girlfriend"". I usually masturbate almost everyday  trying to simulate some sort of intimacy . 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the interesting part. So about a month ago, my best friend's ex girlfriend (F19) started working at my job. At first i thought to my self ""man , ""i can't believe she is working here (in disappointing tone) "". She messaged me on Instagram and i would respond to her messages at first just to be nice but after a while , i started to develop a crush on her. (Yea, i know , i shouldn't have). She also developed a small crush on me. I noticed that she would always respond to my messages and she would almost always put some effort to having a quality conversation with me . This is what i liked about her. I loved the attention that she gave me and i felt really good . Now there are times when i would text her and we would just have nothing to talk about but i can also tell that she appreciated me texting her. 

The one thing that makes her completely different is she likes to be touchy when she is around me at work . I kinda don't like it when she touchy at work cuss i don't want people at work to assume or know that there is something between us. But if me or her ever had a room to our self's, i would want her to be as touchy as she can be.

So one day, i  finally asked her if she wanted a one night stand and her initial response was no mainly because she said she couldn't handle her emotions after we had sex and because im best friends with her ex boyfriend. But surprisingly she actually changed her mind . ( i was so confused when she changed her mind but i was happy with it and i told her to speak up and change your mind if she needed to). After she agreed, i did everything to make sure it was consensual sex. We than talked sexual boundaries and how we are going to meet up. What sucked was she told me she was on her period and we wouldn't be able to have sex until she is off her period. (she has irregular periods that can last a couple of weeks to 2 month)

During this time of my life, i was basically at the high of my emotions. I had never had sex before (she is well aware of my past and me being a virgin) so i was kinda nervous just thinking about it. I was really excited thinking how me and her are going to cuddle, kiss, make out , and i get to lose my virginity to her. I just enjoyed the idea of passionate slow sex.

Everything was going well until she kissed me . üò•

So a few days after i asked if we could have a one night stand, i was getting off of work and she needed a ride home XD. She asked if i could give her a ride home and i said sure. At this point, i kinda know whats going to happen. When me and her sat down , she asked if she could kiss me and i said yes üòÅ. I had my first kiss and i was terrible lol. She kissed me again and said my lips are vary tense. It was a bit awkward after that. After she kissed me , she told me how she felt guilty for kissing me. She also told me shortly after why we shouldn't have sex  and that we should keep our distance from now on.

Through out all of this , i was pretty calm and not trying to force anything on her . I always made sure to respect every decision she made. 

What sucks now is things are back to normal. I don't have a girl to talk to and say good morning to. I don't have a girl to call whenever I'm bored.  It just sucks being in my position.

To fix this problem, i have continuously thought of the idea of seeing an escort but they are so fricking expensive (+700  per hour). I have tried going to the strip club twice but i didn't get the level of intimacy i was looking for. It wasn't the stripper's fault or the strip club's fault, its just that the level of intimacy i wanted can't be found at the strip club. I have tried using Tinder, Bumble, And Ok Cupid for 3 months and i had no serious matches that were willing to have a simple date and go out for coffee. 

All i want is intimacy. I wish it wasn't this hard for me.",lonely,My life was a rollercoaster a couple of weeks ago.,2020-04-26 12:49:51

491,9Lives-1down,1587851196,1,"I‚Äôm a high school senior.

Almost everyone either knows who I am or has heard of my name in my senior class.  All the advanced teachers and the higher ups know who I am.

I‚Äôm a very accomplished student; it appears that I am the one who got into the most prestigious university (an Ivy League) out of all my peers. My senior year was going great.  I got my acceptance to my top school and even managed to get into a relationship with my new crush.  It was my very first relationship.

Everything was going great.  An Ivy acceptance  and a girlfriend? I have never felt so happy in my entire life before.

About 2 and a half months later since the relationship started, she broke up with me.  She was very vague for her reasons for leaving.  She ended up dating some guy a week or two after our breakup with someone she told me she didn‚Äôt have feelings for.

Although the breakup was not the main reason I‚Äôm depressed, it was a big part.  The breakup made me realize that I‚Äôm a nobody.

I‚Äôm not a very social person.  In my whole high school career before my relationship I have only gotten out once with my friends.  After each school day, I go study, do my homework, play video games on the weekends, eat, and sleep. 

I‚Äôm an only child living only with my mom.  My dad is in another state.  I haven‚Äôt seen him in over a year.  I‚Äôm not really intimate any of my family members.  I think it‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt make any meaningful bonds with my.  Also especially because my mom does not have any great parenting skills.  On a daily basis, my mom and I argue.  I never tell her anything about my life and we never converse.

I absolutely hate my mom.  I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúlove‚Äù or a special connection to her.  She treated me like I‚Äôm still a baby and is very clingy.  I frequently tell her about the stuff she does that bothers me but she does not seem to care. Nothing has been changed in many years.  Not to mention she cheated on my dad, twice.  And one of the times I‚Äôve actually heard it with my ears.  I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable talking to my online friends while she‚Äôs in the house.  Every time I make a phone call I do it outside my house.  She loves to eavesdrop on other people‚Äôs conversations and I don‚Äôt want her eavesdropping mine.

Also, I don‚Äôt think I have any ‚Äúlove‚Äù or connection with my dad either.  He‚Äôs been gone for such a long time period in my life (except over the phone) that I don‚Äôt even miss him and I don‚Äôt know why.  And I‚Äôm sure if I was away from my mom I would definitely not miss her either.  I wish I could just restart life with a much more cohesive family.

I don‚Äôt have a best friend.  My ex-best best friend, from my childhood, took a different path than me.  Although he was a little friendly with me, he started bullying me in middle school.  Because of him, I started developing trust issues.  By high school, rumors have it that he started taking drugs and even got arrested.  

Also, I‚Äôve been bullied consistently through middle school which contributed to my trust issues and social abilities.  Not a lot of my middle school class knew who I was. 

My childhood best friend and I used to hang out every weekend before middle school.  I‚Äôd always go to his house and play down video games with him or go somewhere with my dad doing tasks outside the house.

Although I do have a lot of good friends, I don‚Äôt have any great bonds with them.  I only know the surface level stuff about them.  My friendships end at the end of the school day.  I occasionally text them but not frequently.

My ex was a different story.  I don‚Äôt know what was special about her but I wanted to know her more on a deeper level.  We became friends this school year and I just loved every aspect about her.  We used to text every day. I considered her my only ‚Äútrue‚Äù friend and best friend who I had chemistry with.  She made me confident in my social skills and I was pretty great at flirting with her.  We had some similarities in our childhoods also.  We kind of entered into a relationship naturally without even asking each other if we wanted to be bf/gf.

Like I said before, I don‚Äôt really hang out with anyone.  But with my ex, I went out of my comfort zone with her. I went over to her house, and I haven‚Äôt been over to a friend‚Äôs house in more than 5 years. I also invited her over to my house, and I haven‚Äôt invited someone to my house in over 6 years.  She‚Äôs the only high school friend that has ever seen my room.  

I started to hang out with her on a frequent basis, something I haven‚Äôt done since my childhood with my ex-best friend.  I enjoyed every second of it.  After arriving at my home after a certain date, I started crying in my room because she meant so much to me.

Although her reasons to break up were vague, One big part that I can guess that convinced her to break up with me was that I was clingy.  I gave her priority over my friends and family.  She was the only person I would text and hang out with.  She told me she didn‚Äôt like that as she gave me equal priority as her close friends.  I wanted to change so I could still be in a relationship with her but she said people shouldn‚Äôt change to make a relationship work.

And she got into another relationship about a week or two after we broke up with some guy that she told me while we were still in a relationship that she never had feelings for him.  Before we entered into a relationship she said that guy had a crush on her but she didn‚Äôt really feel the same way. Well now guess what, they got into a relationship so fucking quickly.  I started crying during one of my classes when I found out about it.

I think I developed more trust issues and a severe form of depression.  I think about killing myself every day.  I wished I could form a bond with a friend like I did with my ex.  But I can‚Äôt.  I don‚Äôt really have good chemistry with any other person or even my family.  I wish I had a best friend that I could trust, that I could text or call or hang out on a frequent basis.  But at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to leave my comfort zone just to get hurt again.  I wish I had close friends.  I wish I could just restart my life so I could be a more social person and maybe even have siblings.  Right now, I‚Äôm very lonely.  I would love to make close friends but I‚Äôm too shy and scared to do so.  I have already gambled for close friends I don‚Äôt want to gamble again.

I‚Äôd trade my Ivy acceptance to continue with my ex or find someone else that I could be with for a lifetime.  Never felt joy like that before in my entire life.  The only reason why I did well in school to get into a prestigious institution was that it would help me make a shit ton of money which would make me happy.  But I guess that money really doesn‚Äôt buy happiness.

Yes, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs plenty of fish in the sea‚Äù, but given my personality and my trust issues, I‚Äôm doubtful someone who shares the same interests would give me a chance.",lonely,I‚Äôm Someone yet No One,2020-04-26 07:46:36

505,Shallowaffect,1587843111,2,"For a while I‚Äôve been studying dog training on my own, I have 2 pups I work with. Today while I was out training with one of them I was in a park and I thought I recognized another dog trainer from a far. I‚Äôve trained my own dogs and some family. No public training yet. Anyways I‚Äôve struggled so hard finding someone to teach me to the point I‚Äôve given up several times but since it‚Äôs the only thing I genuinely enjoy I‚Äôve give it a shot again and have been for a while now. I was doing some training and right before leaving I decided I wanted to check out who was training across the field because where I‚Äôm from there‚Äôs not any dog trainers tbh. So as I‚Äôm doing some leash work as I head over one of the trainers dogs he was working with zoomed out and came for mine. I have experience so I was fine I just grabbed the other dog and brushed it off(usually I‚Äôd be very upset if something like this happened this is dangerous). Anyways I approach them and ask if I can watch he says yes. 5 minutes after he approaches me when he‚Äôs done with his client. I ask him about his dog training because I took some interest in him because I don‚Äôt know any other dog trainers and I really want to become one I tell him straight up I‚Äôm just interested in shadowing he says okay tells me I can come to his next session &amp; then he proceeds to look at my dog. All this time my dog has showed perfect recall, awesome leash work, &amp; even did great when the dog he was training got out of his control and went after mine. Now he‚Äôs looking at my dog and asks me his name he‚Äôs trying to get his attention and get him to come. My dog is ignoring the strange man (as I taught him to do) and he looks at his collar and realizes it‚Äôs a prong collar and starts saying how he‚Äôs too young to use that he‚Äôs 7 months old it‚Äôs properly fitted &amp; I use it for guidance. He walks perfect on leash so it never affects him anyways. I use it more to redirect him to a sit position. After that he just starts saying a whole much of shit I already know about dog training and says he doesn‚Äôt believe in correcting a dog as he‚Äôs leash popping his clients dogs to the point where he could break their neck cause he just kept leash popping over and over without a break. I do a prong leash pop it‚Äôs better because I don‚Äôt have to put that much force into it. If I popped my dogs leash that way on a prong he‚Äôd for sure scream in pain. Anyways I ignore his rude comments because I can always learn something and even though we might not agree on everything there might be things I can learn from him. He tells me he‚Äôll be right back walls to his next client and basically slanders my training tools. I don‚Äôt get it. I once again ignore it. Waiting for him to come back he walks away tells me he‚Äôll be right back I sat there for 2 sessions waiting for him to come back. I was patient in waiting because it‚Äôs not everyday I see a dog trainer for me actually any day. He tells me he does police protection training which is my end goal of dog training so I talked myself in sitting through the slander because I wanted to shadow some trainings. He walks away doesn‚Äôt come back and after he‚Äôs slandered my tools to about 2 clients he walks right by me leaves and doesn‚Äôt say a word. After he told me to wait for him after I put up with the slander. As if my dogs flashy obedience didn‚Äôt speak for itself. Anyways this made me just so upset because it sucks. It‚Äôs hard learning this on my own &amp; I‚Äôm just confused as to why he was so mean he could‚Äôve told me no. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm using these tools and my dogs aren‚Äôt behaving or pushing fighting the tools. People suck and he sucks. He almost got to me almost but I follow these methods from very very successful and very well known trainers so it‚Äôs not even my method he‚Äôs against idk what I‚Äôm trying to get at I guess I just have no friends to blab about my day with this just triggered me.

514,attackofthealternate,1587837269,1,"Im using an alt because my parents go through my posts on my other account.

I am a 14 y/o male, upper middle class, straight, American 

Im feeling like a looser lately. A while back, like 8 or so months ago, my family and I moved to Washington state from Texas. My parents are very controlling, at least my mom is, shes the one who installed parenting apps on my phone so she can see all the conversations I have. Which is one of the reasons I don't text people because if they or I say anything wrong/sexual/illegal even as a joke she gets pissed off. If I go hang out with anyone, which usually doesn't happen, if she finds out its a girl, even if its not sexual boyfriend/girlfriend stuff, she gets pissed and acts super weird. She doesn't even let me use Reddit or any social media on my phone because she knows theres porn on Reddit (not that I even use Reddit for that, theres better ways of finding media)

Because of all that, secretly I have Instagram installed on my phone so I can talk to and interact with my little friends and people from school without her knowing. She hasn't noticed yet, but I don't know what i'll do when she does. I've had it for about 3 months.

Anyway, now im going to talk about my friend situation. I only have 1 close friend I talk to physically outside of school, and hes a former gay, now asexual, slightly autistic, closeted nazi (he actually likes nazi Germany and dislikes jews, but he doesn't act that way around most people, and usually just makes jokes about it, I hope. He doesn't act on anything about it in public), and he uses Reddit and 4chan. To you he may sound like a bad guy, but most of those things you coudn't even tell about him unless you knew him really well, and im pretty sure he does the nazi stuff as a joke. He also breeds shrimp.

So besides that  I know a few people from school I don't talk to a lot besides this one girl. She dresses like an egirl, like pink hair highlights and teddy fresh/rip n dip clothes, but doesn't like it when you call her that and doesn't act like it. But shes pretty cool and we talk a lot on like insta and at school like every day. She does like really shitty rap music, which is annoying, but shes cool most of the time. Sometimes she gets depressed though and smokes her older brothers weed, I don't know why, probably hormones and shit, but im nice to her about it and try to cheer her up.

And then thats the end of my current close-ish friend situation. Theres also this chad who my parents make me talk to because thier friends with his parents who built our apartment complex. But he got caught smoking weed and now my mom doesn't let me talk to him as much, but I like him a bit.

At the beginning of the year, I was stupid as fuck. I acted like a 7th grader because I didn't talk to anyone over summer because we had to move. I did join a tackle football team, and it was fun and got a lot of anger out and gave me a sense of purpose and discipline, but I was shit at football most of the time and now the seasons been over for a long time. Ok, back to the beginning of school this year. So I was new, nervous, acted like a 7th grader, and didn't really know what kind of culture was at this school because Washington is VERY different from Texas.

 So I made a lot of stupid decisions just to make me look funny, like a 7th grader would, so I could try and get attention/friends and now I cringe at it every night. I would make edgy jokes just to be funny and I was in a group with the Jewish guy who was like a alpha male, I didn't know he was Jewish and I said some stupid things to try and be funny... Like ""finna bouta commit mass genocide"" and other gross stuff a 7th grader would say. I completely regret acting like that now. So basically he got pissy at me and I apologized, but he told all of his alpha friends how much of a jerk I was and then I got bullied for like a month. I got beat up a few times, but they don't anymore. So I just ruined any chances of hanging out with him or his friends. Sad because I thought he was a pretty cool person, too. And he still doesn't talk to me to this day.

I don't act like that anymore. Now I think about the consequences of whatever I say and if its really that funny or not.

For the first few months of the school year, I wouldn't eat lunch and would just go to the library and read because I had no friends. Which sucked, but at least I wouldn't get bullied by that Jewish guys friends at lunch. (You may think that Jewish people are small and nerdy, but the ones here are like super edgy and alpha males for some reason. Probably their magic powers /s)

And the thing is I want to do stupid stuff that teenagers do like smoke weed and drive cars and shoot guns and burn stuff and get drunk and have sex and skateboard (which is a big thing here, I used to be ok at it in Texas, but I lost my skateboard when we moved) and play football and vandalize things like they do in the movies, but theirs a blockage because I have like no friends who do any of that stuff. I really don't want to turn out like my brother whos 17 and doesn't have a drivers license or a girlfriend and just sits on his ass and plays video games all day. I want to be more independent.

Plus corona doesn't help either. No one wants to go outside because of it so I cant hang out with my low amount of friends.",lonely,:(,2020-04-26 03:54:29

520,TheTarquin12,1587833336,0,"Hello there! :)

I'm 22, 5ft7, study Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), and live in central London.

As far as my personality is concerned, my female friends have always said that I'm quite cute, charming, loving and affectionate, so I'm hoping that's your cup of tea! I have always been quite sociable and popular throughout my life, but deep down, I am fairly shy and introverted. I'm quite fun and enjoyable to talk to, however, so I'm sure we'd get on just fine! :)

In terms of my interests, I thoroughly enjoy reading books on philosophy, history, and economics, as well as non-fiction and detective fiction. I also like travelling (lived in 9 different countries till date owing to my dad's job!), discussing politics, following all kinds of sport (especially cricket, football, tennis, chess and badminton), spending absolute hours on good old YouTube, doing loads of window-shopping (I've always had a habit of trying on *reeeally* nice clothes, but hardly ever purchasing them!), playing the piano, listening to a lot of music (primarily EDM, classical, and folk), going on lovely long walks, watching plenty of documentaries and films (mainly comedy and romance), cuddling, and so much more...

I enjoy trying out and doing a wide variety of things, so I can almost guarantee that I would have great fun doing a hobby of yours that is not mentioned in the list above! Just try me! ;)

On that note, thanks a lot for taking the time to read my post! I hope to hear from you soon :)

I‚Äôm in hell with the rest of you. That‚Äôs why there is so many ghosters on reddit. They‚Äôre actually ghosts. They‚Äôve worked their way through the ranks and are higher up in the system than us. They still suffer but they get to fuck with people. I wonder how we work through the ranks? Any of you guys who have been trapped here longer can you give some advice? Is there anyway to get my soul back and re-enter earth? Or am I just stuck in the underworld forever? I‚Äôm glad I figured it out tho. Welcome to hell I suppose.,lonely,I figured it out!

The only reason I haven't given up is I had legit friends at one point in my life that naturally faded as we moved away. I'm trying my best to rebuild that with new people, but it sucks how these days people just leave without an explanation.

542,knockpower,1587816019,1,"I'm 21, 5 years ago I left my country to different one with where another language is spoken (English).

ever since I started going to kindergarten I've always struggled to make meaningful relationships with anyone because I constantly moved schools even after moving where I live now although I still keep contact with few friends back in my hometown,

Since I was about 10 I started getting into the geek world (fantasy, comics) stuff very unpopular back in the day.

adding the fact that I come from a very religious background (I think in my profile you can see my post explaining that in another section), all this factors have influenced in me to isolate from society.

In simple words I've always been an outcast.

Due to my past I've become a very quiet and picky person about the people I let be around me, which means I have almost no friends (at the same time it doesn't mean I am not friendly to others), never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl, never learned how to talk to strangers to make friends (most of my friendships occurred spontaneously with people I was forced to interact with) or how to pick up a girl. As well I'm bad at keeping conversations.

I don't drink, I don't smoke, I'm against the use of any drugs, I don't go to parties, I don't dance, I don't listen to mainstream music (I listen mostly heavy metal and other unpopular genres), and it  seems that these are essential features to make friends nowadays which I lack, and being English my second language doesn't help either.
So for the average person I'm the most boring person ever.

I feel as if I had become an NPC living a routine, wake up, get ready, take my college lessons (online currently), do homework, go to work from evening to about 11 pm, continue homework after getting home and then sleep and repeat, whenever I have the chance to do something fun I do but mostly on my own like playing videogames, going to comic cons, concerts, to the movies, going to geek stores, trying new restaurants, etc.


I don't have contact anymore with the friends I made during highschool, and since September I've been trying to make more friends and although I managed to make friends with a girl in one of my classes and hanged out with her a few times but she's now back in her country, and with this quarantine I can't either socialize with new people nor go out by my self. 
I have good relations with people at my job but almost no one is within my age range (mostly older people) and those about my age none shares the same concepts of having fun with me.

i know you dont think of me ever. you probably hooked up with a ton of girls in college, and didnt think a thing of it. meanwhile, i was back home, crying after kissing another person because it wasnt you. god i fucking hate it. i hate it so much. i know youre probably enjoying your time in quarantine with your amazing family. i miss your parents. i miss your siblings and your dogs and kitty. i miss your house and your room. your hoodies, your piano, your bedsheets, your fucking pillows. i remember giving you those pillows. i wonder if you still have them. 

i still write about you. my poetry is still horrid (i know, you would think that 3 years of writing would pay off :/ ), so i just write just like this. things i remember. memories that pop up out of no where. (i also wonder if you still have the letters i wrote to you.)

i deleted my old socials and every single picture i had of us a long while ago. and while it did help me move on a bit faster, i wish that i could see them again. i found one. the only one i have left. it was at prom, and it was before i started starving, before my SH got really bad, before the disassociation, my attempt, before everything went really wrong in my life.

every april, i think about how during this month, i was the happiest i had ever been. that was the last time i remember being genuinely happy. and april of 2019 was a horror show. this april is looking to end up the same. 

none of this is your fault. you just meant a lot to me. i loved you. but you said that i was too much to handle. and i wish that i wasnt so bad. i wish i didnt have depression or anxiety or any stupid fucking mental illness. because of it, i lost you. i lost a lot of people who meant a lot to me. im sorry. im so fucking sorry, i wish i knew that i was too much. i wish you wouldve told me sooner. 

now, all i do is wish that you‚Äôll one day contact me again. i logically know that you wont, but ill still wish so fucking hard that you‚Äôll reach out. maybe want to meet in person, grab a cup of coffee and listen to jazz in my car. i know you wont though.

i know ive moved on a bit though. i dont cry as long when i look at our prom picture. i can listen to our songs without breaking down. hell, ill sing along to a few of them. i dont think about you 24/7 anymore. ive only had a few dreams about you since may of last year. people are right when they say time will heal it. ive still got a bit to go though. they say your first love never dies though, and im afraid that that will turn out to be true. but until then, ill still continue to move on. to live my life the best i can. 

i hope youre doing well. i hope that youre happy and that college is going well. i hope youre healthy, that youre eating well and staying safe. i hope that your family is well, that your grandma is still well. i hope your orchid is still in bloom. i hope you still wear the hoodie i bought you and that you bought some good games on your switch.

I am a 25 year old male, I have been very lonely lately, and I don't know how to deal with it. I don't have any friends, not a single person has spoken to me in about a year, the last friend I had stopped talking to me for no real reason, we were making plans to get together and she just stopped replying, never to speak to me again. Anyways, I live with my brother, and there is this girl that he is friends with, they talk a lot, and are basically a couple but neither one of them will admit it. Anyways his friend came over to  our apartment tonight and she brought her roommate, they wanted to celebrate out birthday ( we are twins ) even though it is quarantine, there were only four of us  which i guess is fine because it is social gatherings of more than 5 that are banned, but that is another thing. anyways both my brother and his friend were like, oh the roommate will come and that'll be good for you, you can talk to each other. so anyways the night was fine, but I feel like me and this roommate didn't really click, she seems cool and nice but it was a group scenario so having a legit conversation was a bit hard, topics change fast. I never have anything to say in social situations, especially group situations, I feel like I always get talked over and no one pays attention to me. So anyways I think my brother had a good night, he got to hang out with his friend, but I always feel like the third wheel when she comes over here. Like I said she brought her roommate tonight which I think was so I would have someone to talk to. But  it was a group situation and no one ever really talks directly to me in those situations.  I can't help but be jealous of my brother and his friend because they get along so well and I compare myself to them and I have no friends. I want to be happy for them but it just makes me feel even more lonely. I am trying my best to stay positive and know that I'll meet someone someday and we'll be in love and it will be amazing, but right now I feel very alone. The last person I liked stopped talking to me and I feel like when I'm talking to someone else I'm comparing them to her and all i can hope for is someone close to her because, I still think she is cool, even tho she ignores me. So on one hand I  still think of this person a lot but on the other hand why would I hold out hope for someone that'll never come around, so I try my best to move on. but I compare new people to her and on top of that I compare myself to my brother and think it is unfair that his relationships work out and mine don't. and of course i find these feeling to be ugly I wish I did not compare myself to other people and I could simply be happy.

So I would most likely sit by myself at the amphitheater the rare times i attend (attendance isn't mandatory) and get to home asap when the lecture is over. This behavior backfired when my highschool friends had to fullify their military service since they were doing nothing. From the start of january, I hadn't anyone to talk to even on social media.

570,hamartiated,1587788927,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-25 14:28:47

594,makkobargo,1587769383,1,"My last relationship really was something else. I pursued a girl who was in my same class for about two years then finally got together, it was one of those young-love-kind of relationship. Then we broke up. It was awkward at first since we were classmates and all, so it was very embarrassing but we made it through just by behaving as classmates, nothing more nothing less. Then we graduated from high school and chose different paths. One day she texted me saying that she wanted to talk to me. The next day we saw each other and talked. She told me that she believed that we hadn't really experienced to the fullest our past relationship. I told her that it was merely because we were still young and didn't know that much about love in general. She replied by saying that that was the point of asking to meet up with me, she wanted to, this time, to experience it to the fullest, no setbacks whatsoever. I said yes. So we dated and got back together. Our second spell was much better than the first but after a few months, we broke up again. Now we barely talk and I haven't dated anyone else. I don't love her anymore, though, if you ask me, I would definitely give it another chance if an opportunity arises. 

It's been a year now since we broke up, and I've never dated anyone else since then. I feel so awkward and I feel like I've lost that ""ability"" to flirt with girls, text them and ask them out. A part of me always say that I don't have anything to lose if I get rejected or not, whether if it's a turned down offer of""let's get a drink or a coffee one of these days"" but a part of me is also afraid of rejection, that humiliating feeling of being rejected that has always tormented me. I'm 22 now, and I pretty much feel hopeless romantically speaking and left out in certain aspects (which sometimes upsets me to be honest). I might even end up being afraid of women because of my fear of rejection. Is this a normal feeling? I never had sex with anyone, just first base, second base stuff. I'm inexperienced with almost everything when it comes to bed. I feel like after my last relationship, I lost the ability to love, or the ability to fall in love. They say that love will come when you least expect it.. is this true?

600,RivanPro,1587764296,1,"Hey Everyone. My name is Rivan. I'm 18 years old. My birthday is on the eighth of August. I'm currently pursuing... Oh, wait! This isn't an interview, it's just a Reddit post about me. I realised that this quarantine season getting on my nerve and idk this is probably the worst time to be lonely. That's why I decided to post this. Yay! So that's all? No, absolutely not. I decided to tell y'all something about myself. A window into my life. Something which I've been hiding for a long time. So, here I'm writing my heart out. It might be a bit boring so I request you to stop reading if you feel it's gonna waste your time. Go ahead and continue scrolling... Well, you're still here, good! I do want to give you a small disclaimer before I continue. Whatever I'm gonna write now is the way I look at myself, other people may perceive me differently. Now we're cool? Cool! So, I'm just like any other person out there who's trying to survive and find a meaning in life. But I like to see myself a bit differently. I sometimes question my very existence. What purpose do I serve on this planet? Well, it's a question whose answer I'm still trying to figure out. Anyways, I'm a complicated and difficult person. It's really tough for anyone to be my friend. You see, I have this really bad anxiety problem which simply doesn't let me trust anyone or anything. Because of my anxiety, I take everything personally. If someone takes a little too long to answer a text, I start making assumptions. They don‚Äôt want to talk to me. I‚Äôm annoying them. They‚Äôre ignoring me on purpose. They don‚Äôt like me. They hate me. Even if I receive an answer after five short minutes, I will still look too far into details. If the text is short or sounds snippy, then I will worry that I am wasting their time, that they are only answering me to be polite. I will fool myself into thinking I shouldn‚Äôt have sent the text in the first place. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long I have known someone. I need constant reassurance that I am loved. Otherwise, I will jump to the worst-case scenario. I will assume that I have done something to upset them, that they don‚Äôt want me around anymore, that everything is against me. Well, you can say I have major trust issues. And due to this very reason (and a couple of other reasons too), I recently lost a very close friend of mine. I lost someone who stood by me when no one did, someone very important. I really miss her a lot. So yeah, I clearly have issues. But enough of that now. Moving on, I would like to talk about the fact that I've seen people judge me for my looks, the way I talk, the way I interact and it just makes me sick to my stomach. Honestly, I just don't like being judged. I too used to judge people, not gonna lie but I stopped doing that a while ago. I also have anger issues. This something which my roommates and perhaps even my classmates can tell you. I lose my temper very easily. But it's something I'm working on and hopefully, I'll be able to overcome it. What else? Umm... Oh right. I also don't like being around people too much. I really like the comfort of my own bed. I like to sit in complete darkness with my earphones on, disconnected from the real world and lost in my fantasy. (Btw if you got some nice music recommendations then please hmu.) I also like to play with words. Sometimes I just let the emotions flow through my words. One more thing, I'm super lazy. Like seriously super-duper lazy. What else? Well... I suffer from FOMO. So, please just tell me the latest gossip. And oh yeah, I have some major OCD problem. It's really hard to live with that but I'm trying my best. I like to rant a lot. Just give me a topic. Now coming to the good stuff, I'm a huge Marvel fan but my favourite movie series is Back to the future. My all-time favourite song is Bohemian Rhapsody and I'm currently hooked up to If I can't have you. My favourite colour is blue and I am an Apple fanboy. Talking about love, the thing is that... you know what? Let's leave something for the next time. And at last (I promise this the last one), no matter how much people hate me and no matter how many bad things are there on my way, I'll never give up. That's one thing that I've learnt through my struggle to exist is to not give up. Oh wow! I just realised that I've written a lot. As I told you before I overthink a lot so idk if I'm even gonna post this or not. If you're reading it then probably, I've made the biggest mistake of my life. What's done is done. No looking back. TL;DR I'm a not so selfish individual with a bad temper suffering from anxiety and OCD. Honestly speaking, a lot of people seeing this post might not even read it, some might make fun of me but there will be someone out there who's gonna understand and probably relate to me. So to that person out there, a huge virtual hug. If you've made this far then I would like to thank you so much for taking out time to read this. It truly means a lot. Even after reading all of this about me, if you're still interested in talking to me and maybe even telling your own story then please DM me. I'm all ears now. That's all from my side folks. It's truly very relaxing to finally let all of this flow away from my mind. Adios!",lonely,"I am like any other human, trying to find my meaning in this world.",2020-04-25 07:38:16

Every person I have got close to leaves me. I've been a part of two friendship groups in my life and I had to leave those because I was treated really badly.

Even going as far as forcing a friend I was close to, to ghost me. 

Even since, people just don't seem to last long. They either get bored or become busy and lose interest. I lost my best friend because I decided I needed to be alone, after getting my heart broken.

I am 22 years old and I apologize in advance for my English because it's not my native language.
Furthermore, I may be mad but I feel the need to ""throw out"" and share my words, experiences.
-
I have always been comfortable alone and this is not because of my lack of socializing (indeed, it has always been recognized as one of my strengths to be able to speak and get along with everyone) but because I can dedicate body and soul to my passions:
videogames, cinema and Information Tech. industry are my lifeblood (I like to live, deepen, share by writing posts / articles about almost every assimilated work), I like reading and analyzing always new things and, inevitably, I like to reflect (for this reason, I consider music a pillar, especially if it deals with solitude).
-
My problem is that I like loneliness, but (sometimes), at the same time, I feel pretty damn empty.
With 4 other dear friends of mine, we meet 3/4 times a year (this is because there are those who study abroad, those who work as in my case, etc.) after 8 years we know each other from high school; that's fine with me and in any case we write daily to each other via group-chat.
-
I don't have a girlfriend and I don't want to have it, it's not part of my nature:
unfortunately or fortunately (it depends on your point of view), personally, I don't believe in eternal love for a single person but, heck ... despite this, I get too attached to almost every person I know (as in this period since I have been meeting new people since I changed my job 4 months ago), especially if of the opposite sex (in this case, sometimes, I fall in love even if I didn't want to) and this makes me crazy because it makes me feel even more empty despite, at the same time, I feel good alone and I want to be in my solitude.

The problem with society is not that we are not ‚Äùrich‚Äù enough or that we emmit too much ‚Äùgreenhouse gases‚Äù. The problem is that we lack love. We are fueled by victory; we are fueled by being better than someone else when in fact that will only give us a short shot of success and leave us in misery searching for more.

Instead of praising change, we often see it as dangerous

Instead of standing up to the ego (you or someone else) we choose to stay silent in fear.

Instead of seeing every act of nature as a lesson, we see it as a threat. 

Instead of seeing kindness as strength we see it as weakness. 

We create a society that fuels suffering, the suffering leads to addiction to material values and then we blame the addiction instead of society.

Last year I was in a very good relationship with someone I was planning to propose to after the summer was over, but then everything just went wrong in a lot of complicated ways I don't plan to get into. Let's just say I was lied to and betrayed over a ""rule"" of sorts that we had laid out in the very beginning of the relationship. Circumstances around that resulted in me losing confidence in how I look, carry myself, and even my overall outlook on life as a whole.

To keep it short (and I mean real short in comparison), I've been cheated on twice now. Never physical... that I know of. But both were sending NSFW pics/vids to other guys. I was feeling better for maybe a couple weeks and even tried to go on a date. The date went well and yet within a few days I had ghosted them (ik im an asshole) because I was too afraid. Now I feel the same as I did before I was feeling better. I match with people and then never message them. I don't engage any further than necessary with people I like at work. I just can't seem to move myself forward romantically.

We had a strong connection from the moment we met but she lives in a whole different country. We had plans to meet in March before the Coronavirus happened. Flights and hotels were booked. We had planned the things we were going to do when we meet. It was hard for me to comprehend that an amazing girl like her was interested in a dude like me. We were talking almost everyday, sending snaps, facetiming. Her friends back home knew me already. She def has insane amount of guys who hit on her. But since the lockdowns happened there is no way we are going to meet anytime soon and we have been talking less and less everyday. I feel like she is ready to move on or probably already has moved on. Last night I called her up she was heading out somewhere she said she will call me back soon I was up till 3 am waiting for it and then I fell asleep. I suddenly realized she was going to call me back and I woke up at 5 am today and I am waiting like a sucker. Even though I know she won‚Äôt call back.

This was the first time where I connected with someone and we both liked each other as well but the whole fucking universe decided to fuck me over. üòÖ

Stuff keeps popping up in my head that reminds me of my fears and problems (and occasionally those embarrasing moments I had when I was younger)

To make it short: I lost motivation/hope/interest/ in everything I am doing and just can't proceed. I've reached my limit. I am not intelligent/charismatic/strong enough for all the stuff that happens.

So I'm a 21 year old guy and I hardly have 3-4 friends who don't really talk to me unless we are in a group, and even in those situations I can tell it's almost out of pity. Also ofc I've never had a relationship or even a girl hit on me, nor have I ever had the courage or skills to hit on a girl.

These past few days I had been texting this irl female friend of mine and I made the mistake of thinking that things were going somewhere. We were texting almost daily, she would mostly text me first, a few times she even called me just to talk. Our texting conversations were teasy and I made her laugh quite often but on calls I'm fucking stumped. I run out of things to say almost immediately and the conversation either dies or gets really boring. 

Even after this tho she continued texting me things were feeling a little flirty to me until 2 days ago when she suddenly stopped texting. 

I texted her last night, tried to spark a conversation, it worked for like an hour, after which she said, alright ttyl I'm watching a show don't be clingy. This was followed by a silly emoji but damn that shit hurt man. This hurt because this was one of the first times initiated the conversation from my side. 

It was especially hurtful because being seen as clingy is one of my greatest fears. I often avoid talking even to people who like me for the same reason.

At my current school there really isn't anything that interests me. I've been on the golf team both years but that's about it. Because of this (and being an introvert), I haven't really made any new friends besides the ones that I had from elementary and middle school. However, these ""friends"" never invite me anywhere and it hurts to hear them talk about all the fun they had without me every day at break and lunch, especially since I've grown up with them my whole life and can't figure out why they stopped including me. Currently I only have one friend that I'm close with, but I think I've been replaced by someone else and we are just drifting further and further apart. On the other hand, the school I might transfer to has much more of my interests. For starters, they have a two year aviation program. Senior year I would be able to get an internship at an airport which is an amazing opportunity. Along with that, my parents would be much more open to me getting my pilots license now instead of during/after college. As for extracurriculars, the two clubs I attend at my school are also offered there, along with a flight club, ultimate frisbee club, and a few more that caught my attention. The golf team is slightly worse, but golf is more about improving as an individual than being a really good team and they have a better home course. My only worry is that this school is in a completely different district so I don't know anybody that goes there. I hate my school and hate being lonely, but at least I know that I have people to sit with at lunch everyday.

She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say¬†boo.She¬†began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We‚Äôd joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends¬†help.When¬†I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. She had her boss send me a coupon for the restaurant that she worked at.  I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught. then kept getting in the way when we'd walk through and one time got in the way and bent over the supervisor said something.

We went to the same college briefly andshe saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me showed up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside.  I saw her in a store and saw her walk in when I was in line because I looked back when she came in. I immediately looked away and when she got behind me in line and I was leaving she said hi to me in the saddest tone. She got a boyfriend over a year ago. Well I saw her at the store 6 months ago and she said hi then when I held the door open for her said ""oh thank youuuuuu"" in a tone and I think she was being sarcastic. Well recently I blocked her on FB and waited 2 weeks. I unblocked her sent her a message explaining I didn't like her in that way and she made me uncomfortable telling her I want nothing to do with her only had platonic feelings. Well she blocked me on FB.

Some after thought. I‚Äôm resentful, I‚Äôm sad, I‚Äôm lonely, I‚Äôm angry, I‚Äôm annoyed, I‚Äôm bored, I‚Äôm apathetic, I have dreams, Im capable, I‚Äôm hopeless, I‚Äôm useless. I helped people but for selfish reasons, just to see if I can feel something. In the end, it did until moments later, I feel nothing. I get annoyed. People praise me or tell me I‚Äôm smart and capable, putting expectations on me, all my life and now that I‚Äôm at my all time low, I‚Äôm nothing more than lazy and carefree. I didn‚Äôt ask to have a mental illness, I didn‚Äôt ask to not know what to do with these lack of emotions, I don‚Äôt know what to do with my scattered mind, how can I ask for help when all I get is superficial bullshit? I don‚Äôt know anymore. I don‚Äôt want to do anything but sleep. For a long time preferably. I already deleted my social media and no one cared. I just don‚Äôt see the point to put things on me such as expectations, hopes, and other things on me. I just want to say I don‚Äôt care and hope everything fades away. I can‚Äôt say that because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúme‚Äù. I‚Äôve put up facades all my life and whenever I showed my true self, I‚Äôm an asshole, insensitive person. I just don‚Äôt care. I just don‚Äôt know what to do so why should I care about anything. I‚Äôm slowly losing my mind. And no one cares enough. I guess I get what I deserve, for me not caring all this time and putting up facades just to keep everyone pleased, I‚Äôm getting what I deserve. No one t turn to because I‚Äôm already smiling in their heads while dead eyes peer through my mask. Fuck everything. I just want to sleep without my parents waking me up, without people bothering for pointless things, without school putting pointless work up, without my being, being a concern for others. I was always alone. I‚Äôm still alone. 18 years and will continue to for the coming years. I can‚Äôt even cry, I can‚Äôt even muster the motivation to even stay awake. I‚Äôm completely done but no one understands I just don‚Äôt care about the stuff you seem to think I care about. The whole world could be in shambles and I still wouldn‚Äôt give a damn. I‚Äôm sorry.

Finally invited people to my birthday and it was great. Finally got invited to a birthday party and it was great. But why was that joy temporary? Why is it now that I've finally realized how lonely I am? It's made me overthink my relationship with friends. Now I just think they talk to me out of pity or obligation.

670,hamartiated,1587698752,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-24 13:25:52

678,jeoskuuu,1587694510,1,"Hello everyone. It‚Äôs my first time making a reddit post. I am 24 and suffer from severe depression. It runs in both sides of my family.

Anyway, I think my mental state has been getting worse and worse lately. I‚Äôve always had thoughts about suicide but nowadays it‚Äôs all I think about. I even make plans sometimes. I wish I was in California. I‚Äôd take a walk, get high, and jump of the Golden Gate Bridge.

But the thing is i can‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt leave my mom behind. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her. 

I have no friends and I am not super close to my family. Nowadays I cry multiple times a day and I have no one to talk to. I feel pathetic. I‚Äôm even crying as I write this.

I don‚Äôt want to kill myself because I can‚Äôt do that to my mom, and I don‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôll die of natural causes anytime soon. I‚Äôm just in a state of misery. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt afford therapy and my antidepressants never work so I stopped taking them a few weeks ago.

I can‚Äôt make friends. I think I might be on the spectrum or something. I don‚Äôt know though. I have no one to talk to and I‚Äôm just so lonely.  I haven‚Äôt been to a good doctor since I was like fifteen so I wonder is it just depression? Sometimes I think I might be bipolar too or even schizophrenic but I‚Äôm not an expert. 

I never feel like myself anymore. I am just sad pathetic person living in my body. Nothing brings me happiness and I don‚Äôt want to live anymore. Some days are awful, some are tolerable, but overall it‚Äôs getting worse

Anytime I try and reach out to people I overwhelm them and they stop talking to me. I‚Äôve been self destructive and pushing people away.  I can‚Äôt even do my school work anymore and I‚Äôm swamped with work I need to do

My girlfriend and I broke up a few months ago and she‚Äôs living a happy life. She told all her friends (people I thought liked me) that I am suicidal (even though I never wanted people to know). Even though people know this no one has reached out to me. No one asked how I felt about the break up no one asked how I am no one cares that I‚Äôm quarantined. No one cares about me. 

I recently hacked into one of her accounts. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have it‚Äôs an invasion of privacy and a dick move. But I was reading her messages with her friends and all they say is fuck him (me) and that I‚Äôm a piece of shit. I know I‚Äôm not the perfect person but I didn‚Äôt think I was that bad. I can‚Äôt see all the messages cause it‚Äôs only one social media account out of many. She said in the messages that I wasted five years of her life. To me those were the best five years of my life. I never meant to be a bad person. 

People always talk about mental health awareness and acceptance but when they see an example of it they just label me as a jerk or something. Anytime my ex tweets that she‚Äôs sad or something she gets like a dozen replies telling her she‚Äôs loved and supported and her friends are there for her. But why not me? Am I that bad of a person? 

My entire existence meant nothing to her. She moved on. She‚Äôs talking to other guys. She even is getting with her ex again. How am I supposed to live knowing the person who knows me better than anyone on this planet doesn‚Äôt love me or care about me. I meant nothing. She already replaced me.

696,psychocandid,1587685387,1,"I had a delusional episode centered around my favorite professor at uni. I thought he was infatuated with me and indirectly communicating his desire to have an affair with me. I started to believe he was communicating to me via coded language in his lectures and paper comments. 

It started out relatively plausible but quickly got VERY bizarre and delusional. For instance, I interpreted what I believed to be an excessive use of words beginning with ‚Äús‚Äù in an email to me, to be his way of playfully aligning himself with the ‚Äúhissing‚Äù serpent who seduced Eve in the Bible (we were studying Milton‚Äôs Paradise Lost in his class). I even thought at one point that he had mistaken me for a prostitute and was trying to solicit my services (all because of things he had said in lectures, which I interpreted as code). I even thought he was flagging himself as a BDSM practitioner, based on the color and position of his pocket squares and wristwatch, which contained clues as to his particular fetishes. I also thought he was trying to seduce and hypnotize me using NLP (neurolinguistic programming). I also thought he was confessing his genuine love for me throughout all of this. 

After I ‚Äúrejected‚Äù him (by essentially ignoring what I perceived to be his advances and telling him I thought he had misinterpreted my platonic, academic admiration), I became increasingly paranoid.

At one point, I thought he was threatening to rape me and potentially kill me because the word ‚Äúyou‚Äù had been left out of an email (a typo surely, though I thought it was intentional, and a threat to ‚Äúeliminate me‚Äù if I told anyone about his indiscretions). I thought the fact that he named his son after a famous fictional serial killer was significant. I started to think he might be a serial killer. 

Long story short, I left school for a semester and when I came back and saw him in person I almost immediately realized how harmless he was. It became increasingly obvious that I was paranoid and totally delusional, though it never stopped seeming like he was infatuated with me. It‚Äôs been four years and I still have so much admiration and ‚Äúlove‚Äù for hom. I won‚Äôt act on it of course, as he is 30 years older than me, and married, but the feelings are there. 

I only told psychiatrists about this after the fact (I was not in therapy during the time that the delusion was actually occurring). It was one of the most painful experiences of my life to hear that I was delusional, not only because of the paranoid delusions, but also because of the delusions about his love for me (erotomania). It was horrible to realize I had wasted four years of my life believing a lie. A lie I still can‚Äôt seem to get out of. It makes me feel so embarrassed. Worse than embarrassed. Humiliated. Ridiculous. Pathetic.

I been prescribed Abilify more than once, but have had the most horrible reaction (fainting, naseous, urinary problems, fatigue). I‚Äôm at the point where I am doing ok without medicine, but I still usually comfort myself with the fact that he is in love with me.

When the whole thing started I was stressed and overwhelmed by my family situation, my academic struggles, my depression and anxiety and my feelings for/growing dependency on this professor. I‚Äôm estranged from my real father and we have never been close. In fact I am extremely uncomfortable around him. I had no uncle or brother or grandfather I was close to either. When I was little, my father used to french kiss me and our relationship was generally rather inappropriate. I don‚Äôt know if this experience was as formative as the abuse I suffered from my mother but I‚Äôve always longed for an older male presence in my life and I tend to unconsciously sexualize my relationships with men, no matter how old they are.   

When I met him, though, something changed. No one had ever talked to me or treated me the way my professor did. When we talked in office hours it was like he really saw me. He sympathized with me, laughed with me, encouraged me, valued my mind, and seemed like he really cared. I was lonely, friendless, and starved for love and affection and companionship. I was also sexually inexperienced and traumatized. All this combined with the fact that I am naturally imaginative and prone to fantasy and ‚Äúoverthinking.‚Äù I think it was all just the perfect storm for a temporary bout of ‚Äúmadness.‚Äù 

I can normally function fine nowadays but once I start thinking about him, it is hard to stop. I either delve into a comforting flight of fantasy about how infatuated HE is with me, or am flooded with loads of negative thoughts about how pathetic I am and how weird and annoying I must seem to him and everyone else. I get the most painful headache and feel like crying. 

It‚Äôs hard to distract myself because I see him frequently in the halls and department events. (It‚Äôs a small school). He is also my advisor.

Tl;dr: suffered a psychotic break my first year of college that made me believe my professor was obsessed with me. Finding it hard, four years later, to accept that he could care less about me. Might even be terrified of me.",lonely,I‚Äôm fucking pathetic,2020-04-24 09:43:07

I prefer not to share my feelings with anyone, especially when it comes to my family, and recently its been impacting me in different ways. I am scared to throw all those feelings on to one, maybe that one person who actually does have a pretty decent life that doesn't want to be bombarded with negativity. My family isn't one to tell things to, they wear a mask. You see, they tell you ""It makes me upset that you don't come to talk to me anymore"" or my favorite one, ""I won't tell anyone ever, I'm not like said family member"" My family is like a reality TV show but only four of us know whats going on and watch it happen to like some sort of play. Yesterday, it made me really sad to see my cousin come to text me a bit concerned about our relationship. She and I were always by each others side until apparently she went behind my back last year. I'll be honest, I didn't even recall what happened, but it did. For her to even acknowledge what she did wrong, and for her to apologize months later when I didn't even remember what happened is such a mature thing to do, and I find it sad that not even my own mother or sister would do that. But after having that conversation with my cousin, I still feel like I will always be lonely. Yes: she is my cousin. Yes: I love her to death and I just want her life to be perfect and I want her to come to me for anything. But, my head is always telling me, can you really trust them? And it's not only with her, its with everyone. It's been played to many times from people who I thought (sister&amp;mom) would always have my back, so is it wrong to feel the way I do? My brother is also one of the other sane people in the family, and I go to him for things when its really really important. One big tip he has given to me when I was a bit younger was ""Don't tell anyone anything."" I didn't really listen to him though and learned the hard way. That lead to me telling my sister stuff after she said (segway back to what I said before) ""I won't tell anyone ever, I'm not like said mom."" And then mom knew the next day. Then my father knew. This led to bad unnecessary drama. Then months later, I moved out of my parent's house at the age of 15 into my brothers. I've been happier, healthier, more responsible, and in some ways a bit more independent. I'm grateful for being here, but me holding everything in still is so hard. And most of these things I can't just tell my brother. I've been stealing alcohol, I haven't been showering, I haven't been cleaning, I've been contemplating suicide the last 2 weeks.

I‚Äôm from England and we have lots of canals so I rode down those, along the path there‚Äôs a lock (a way for boats to go up and down a hill) but you can‚Äôt really ride over it. She gets off and walks over, I do the same. She tells me to go ahead because she‚Äôs too slow so I oblige but joke about how I‚Äôll be tired in a sec and she‚Äôll catch up. 

Well one bridge later I was in too high a gear and I had to stop and she was right behind me. I said ‚Äútold you‚Äù and we both laughed. I asked where she was going and thought to myself maybe this is my chance to make a friend. We were riding almost together but not really it was like a grey zone of are we riding together or shall we just carry on our own ways?

But we rode together, we were joking, laughing, smiling having a good time. Telling each other about our lives outside of lockdown, our jobs and what hobbies we have. I only planned on 10 miles but she told me she was going further so I decided I‚Äôd join her. We ended up going 15miles one way before we turned around. She gave me a sweet because I had nothing to eat but the flies that kept finding their way into my mouth. 

It was fucking amazing. 

For the first time in years I just felt relaxed, myself, I was actually having fun with someone I didn‚Äôt know the name of yet. She is the reason I would end up doing over 30 miles and not just 10. She helped me get home because I had no idea where I was. All around just a great time joking and enjoying the ride. 

She said that none of her friends had bikes so she just went out alone and I told her I don‚Äôt even have friends let alone ones with bikes but she just laughed and said ‚ÄúI highly doubt that.‚Äù On the way back were a series of locks going uphill. I was no way fit enough to make it up but she sprinted up like it was nothing. It was impressive. But I thought she‚Äôd just gone and carried on and left me. Then, when I got to the top she waited. 

SHE FUCKING WAITED! It‚Äôs honestly one of the nicest things someone I have never met before has done for me in years. She was obviously much fitter than me and wanted to go faster but she waited for me. I was so happy. 

We got to where she had to turn off and I asked if I could give her my number. She said her boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt like it and then just said straight away ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve got to go here I‚Äôll probably see you around‚Äù and just left. Just like that. I felt shit and not because she didn‚Äôt take my number but because I hadn‚Äôt had so much fun since I can remember.

Not quite sure what to say here, seeing as this is my first post. Idk, I guess I just got tired of journaling.  
I've been dealing with this for four years so I'll keep the backstory short.

When I turned 19, my family decided to migrate to Australia (Don't get me wrong, I love it here in Melbourne). My dad had been working in Perth for about three years prior and he and mum had been talking about possibly moving out of the homeland, but I never thought they'd go for it, much less tell me about it on my birthday. It felt like a cruel joke, having gone around the sun for nineteen years, eager to get my life started, making plans for that future only to have it torn down as soon as it got started. 

By that time, I'd made this particular group of friends. We weren't anything special, but I considered them my entire world. I was a huge solitary type back in high school. I never really had ""best friends"" before, so being in this group of misfits made me feel at home. They were everything to me. Of course, I had to say goodbye to them. They promised they'd stay in touch no matter what.

Although recently I feel like they've already forgotten me.

It's no secret that this whole pandemic is limiting people from going out. With the flood of all these Zoom calls and such, I kinda figured now would be a good time to catch up with them. i hadn't heard from any of them since Christmas last year. I understood that we had our own lives and that we couldn't always message one another every day. So I would message them, either as a group or individually, if they were down for a call. They were either offline and they didn't see the message or they said they were busy with their own uni work. So I backed off. I figured they'd make time for me when they could.

I was scrolling Instagram tonight (it's roughly 1:59am as I type this) and I saw one of my friends' stories. It was them. They were all in a video call without me. They didn't tell me, they didn't message me, they didn't even so much as mention me in the story saying that they missed me. I was gutted. I felt so riled up that I had the urge to throw my phone across the room and just scream into my pillow.

I don't know what else to say. I want to hate them for leaving me out but I can't bring myself to hate them. I just feel so broken and hollow, I'm like this ghost everyone seems to ignore so naturally. I'm just tired of being so lonely all the fucking time.",lonely,feeling like a ghost,2020-04-24 02:01:21

Hello there! üëã i‚Äôm here to find friends. so here we go!

these are some of the random things/topics we could talk about -

 ~ ùóôùóúùóüùó†ùó¶ - I know right!? Sounds so original! I watch a shit ton of films. I usually prefer old and foreign cinema and indie dramas. But i‚Äôm up to watch absolutely anything! We could talk about our favourite films. we can talk about the deep lying meanings behind them, their allusions and the cinematography. We could watch movies together too if we get closer :)

 ~ ùó©ùóúùóóùóòùó¢ ùóöùóîùó†ùóòùó¶ - I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm a dedicated or hardcore gamer. I play on my ps4 on weekends for amusement. I like playing campaigns and exclusives and a lot of FIFA, i know it‚Äôs awful but I love it! We could talk about our favourite games and you could recommend me some too and maybe even play together.

 ~ ùóîùó•ùóß &amp; ùó£ùóõùóúùóüùó¢ùó¶ùó¢ùó£ùóõùó¨ - heck yeah, i‚Äôm an intellectual. not really haha, well recently i‚Äôve started to develop a profound interest in art as well as philosophy. we could talk about how michelangelo made love to marble or why every single author has to quote Dante in their books lol

~ ùóïùó¢ùó¢ùóûùó¶ - I‚Äôm not really a bookworm but I absolutely adore reading! I read almost all genre of books except those cringy romantic novels ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I generally prefer historical fictions, biographies, classics, fiction, science and philosophical books ooo

~ ùó¶ùóñùóúùóòùó°ùóñùóò - Believe it or not, i actually enjoy a couple of different sciences. I am a bit geeky and nerdy and mostly like astronomy and psychology. I cherish talking about ways we could improve our future and climate change, well that sounded corny but we can talk about almost every nerdy topic your mind can conjure and i‚Äôll be 100% on board.

~ ùóßùó© ùó¶ùóõùó¢ùó™ùó¶ - So basically i haven‚Äôt had any friends for the last 4 years and i‚Äôve had lots of free time on my hands and i‚Äôve watched at least 40-50 TV shows. Some of my favourites would be Mr. Robot ( YES I WORSHIP ELLIOT ALDERSON), Euphoria, Fleabag, Breaking Bad, The Leftovers, Rick and Morty (obviously), Sherlock etc etc. We can talk about how Sam Esmail and Phoebe Waller-Bridge are revolutionaries in the TV industries. I‚Äôve also watched a bunch of sitcoms like Friends, The Office, Brooklyn99. 

~ ùóôùó¢ùó¢ùóßùóïùóîùóüùóü  - A big part of my life is dedicated to football (soccer) and it‚Äôs helped me a lot throughout the years. I‚Äôm an avid Arsenal supporter and well if you‚Äôd like to talk about why Harry Kane should have squared it or why Martinelli is going to be better than Mbappe, I‚Äôm your guy.

~ ùó†ùó®ùó¶ùóúùóñ - I mean who doesn‚Äôt listen to music nowadays, so we‚Äôre always gonna have something to talk about. I don‚Äôt think my music taste is the most hip or different but I can assure you it‚Äôs pretty fuckin eclectic. I listen to a bunch of different genres and my playlists consist of Fiona Apple to Run DMC to Harry Styles to Eminem and well a whole fuck ton others.

~ ùó†ùóòùó†ùóòùó¶ - If you think tiktok is a valid and relevant platform and that it‚Äôs funny, then please i repeat PLEASE do not contact me. I usually enjoy D A N K memes and have a dark sense of humour. So I can be your meme dealer and supply you with the creme of the crop.

~ ùóîùó°ùó¨ùóßùóõùóúùó°ùóö ùóîùóß ùóîùóüùóü - If you haven‚Äôt found anything that you‚Äôd like to talk about, we can talk about absolutely anything you‚Äôd like. I would love to learn new things and be a part of many wide-ranged interesting conversations with you!


I think those points have told you a lot about the interests i have and what kind of things i enjoy, now onto some personal stuff about me,


I‚Äôm a 18 year old guy, almost 19. i think i‚Äôm bisexual but i‚Äôm not sure yet so i think bi-curious. I do not know at all as of now, I like to think of sexuality as a spectrum and I could be attracted to anybody, i like who i like i guess. Welp, do you wanna go on a journey of self-discovery and uncovering your sexuality with me!? Hop on amigo!

I‚Äôve finished high school and will be going to university to study either software engineering or cybersecurity later this year if 2020 can calm tf down for five fuckin seconds

I haven‚Äôt had many friends throughout my life and right now, I don‚Äôt think I have any. I mostly like to keep to myself unless i develop a strong connection with the other person. i‚Äôm quiet and ambiverted i think because i could definitely turn it up if i find my people. i have some mental health issues, i‚Äôm on anti-anxiety meds but that‚Äôs just a small part of who i am.

you can ask me as many questions as you like if you‚Äôd like to get to know me better and i‚Äôd be more than happy to answer them!

it doesn‚Äôt matter to me what your gender/sexuality/race is or what country or timezone you‚Äôre from, all that matters is that you be yourself and want to be friends with me :)

im looking for long-lasting friendships here. we can become close to each other and talk every day, share memes, secrets. talk about whatever‚Äôs bothering you. i can have fun, weird, serious and deep conversations. we can offer support and motivation to each other and be best buds!

and if things work out for the best, we could be life-long friends and meet each other and keep contact forever which would be absolutely fucking fantastic.

i usually prefer talking on instagram but we can talk on any platform you‚Äôd like if we hit it off so feel free to let me know :) 
 
okay then! if you‚Äôve made it so far, you‚Äôre either interested in talking to me or you‚Äôre just idek what you‚Äôre doing. anyways, sorry for the super boring and long essay but if you‚Äôd like to be friends, send me a dm! i am super excited to meet you and get to know you! ü¶Ñ",lonely,Attention! ‚ö†Ô∏è Make a totally normal and interesting human friend!

I can't remember when someone genuinely asked me ""how are you"" and if I don't continue talking... Well contacts just stop. 

I moved to Danmark some time ago and that didn't help the fact that i feel more alienated than ever. I tried to include myself in groups but I'm always the outsider. My mother left when I was 4 and my Father was abusive, i have been in two long term relationships with abusive partners that took me way to long to end... That resulted in me having seperation anxiety and it's like I'm addicted to people having to like me.

760,YourObedientKitten,1587629685,1,"This is just a little vent. Please don't mind my account, I'm using this instead of my sfw because I'm afraid that if any of my schoolmates find my sfw account again... I just don't want them to read this.

So yeah. What's the problem? Every time I start talking to someone they seem to ""get busy"" and then disappear. No I'm not talking about a day or two... They just don't come back. I've tried to message people on r/needafriend, I've tried using slowly, I've tried omegle, Randochat, Reddit. I've made a chat group on discord, I made a roleplaying server on discord and just everything seems to die.

On r/needafriend people actually replied to back. For some time. But most of them stopped replying within a day. Some replied to my hi the next day and there it ended.

On omegle are mostly horny men looking for girls, trolls or actual girls that are there for unknown reasons or chill males, which are usually rare. If I manage to give a person my Instagram we talk for few hours or less and then we never really talk again. If I try to start a conversation then I either get a reply or is left on seen.

On Randochat it's the same. Mostly left on seen without even starting a chat.

Slowly is actually the only app where I can chat. It usually takes few hours to deliver a mail but its still something and I'm grateful to have it. Whenever I manage to move with someone on the a different app /discord, ig etc / the chat lives for a few days until it dies. Sometimes we chat for few more days when I message them but it dies.

From slowly I've managed to find a girl that lived in fact in the same city as me. After some talking I've managed to ask her to hang out with me and she agreed! I felt really happy and nervous too because I was worried I would fuck up this friendship. We met and.... There was nothing to talk about. I've tried to talk but.. Well.. You know. In the end she said she enjoyed my company and actually gave me a hug. Which felt incredible. When I messaged her the next day, no reply came. After some time I messaged her again and we talked for few minutes and she explained that there isn't really anything to talk about and it would be the best if we would end this friendship.

My schoolmates are well.. Guys I don't really have anything to talk about. But when we still went to school we chatted a bit! At least about school or a subject. They're mostly interested in alcohol, drugs (Marijuana from what I've heard), cigarettes, sex and girls. Then there are some interested in anime and games such as csgo or gta V online. But mostly about gta V online. And about fashion. They know memes but they have some weird sense of humor usually. Or is it me that has weird sense of humor?

As you could notice I don't really have friends but I've actually managed to chat with a girl on Instagram for months now. I'm grateful that she is my friend and even if we don't have anything to talk about at least I can send her memes and help her with homework if she needs.

All I am questioning is. Where am I making the mistake. I'm now certain that the mistake is in me. Is it because I'm boring? I don't do much in life only write from time to time and play games. I don't really listen to music or watch movies or something. Am I too annoying? I don't know and even if I accepted that the mistake is in me it's still bothers me that I don't know where.. Where is it..

I felt like posting because I felt shitty but I wasn't sure what to say, I've been posting here for a while now but this is a new account, I kept deleting posts and abandoning chats so I just decided to make a new profile. I wasn't aware of the chat settings and after just a few messages from someone I would get overwhelmed and just stop but and I feel real shitty about it and I just ended up doin this.

I've been lonely for a long time and now that school is done I haven't even left my house in a long time. I thought I was starting to do better and school and maybe maybe just a little bit barely connecting in a tiny way with one or two people in the place I lived, it felt like getting the painstaking first layer of a giant house of cards built and taking a breather about to start the second and someone proceeds to knock over the table, pull my chair out from under me and hit me with it. I soon fucking realized this happens all the fucking time. I've moved a good few times and its always hard to make friends and every time aside from the place I live in now I've actually been able to wedge myself in a friend group or two but people always fucking just drop. So many people I love so much so many people that meant so much are just fucking gone and even if i tried to reach out now were both completely different people, it feels like every time I've moved I've been able to get a bit of that first layer built up only to have it knocked down again and on top of that a shit ton of the cards slide under the fucking door and now i gotta start with almost and entire new pack and I honestly feel like I would rather just try to stop making card houses but at the same time it just ends up fucking happening.

Hey fellow loners. I am also alone like you all. I don‚Äôt know why. Well sometimes i think i don‚Äôt know how to live. Like no one told me all the rules. Most of my life i just flowed like a river and life was good. But then i had few bad experiences and now i just can‚Äôt move on, its been a long time, in years. 
You know i scared myself at how good i have got with living alone. I am very efficient, on practical level i am self sufficient. But there is hole in my heart, i want to connect with another person on a personal level. To see, to hear, to understand and to be seen, to be heard and to be understood.
I have this theory that most evil people are just people who were never loved. Being loved is very important to us humans. Lack of love makes us mean, sad and paranoid. And the irony is that we all have great capacity to love, how people love dogs, cats, even plants. But we are very picky when loving other humans, we hold back our love, we are scared of a heart break, so we suffer.
Maybe trying to a live a life honest to oneself is a mistake. Maybe the right way is to look the other way  and just take what life is giving you, find a way to get back to the flow, get out of my own way. Maybe...

Grab a hoodie, a blanket, a normal pillow, and either a decorational pillow(small rectangle) or a pillow case with shirts or something in it.

Roll up the blanket and feed it through both armholes of the hoodies. 

Place the normal pillow in the main area of the hoodie and put it under or over the section of blanket in the middle area of the hoodie. (Under for girl, over for guy.)

Place the decorational pillow/stuffed pillow case in the hood of the hoodie. If you are using the decorational pillow you can push it into the hoodie and place one of the ends in between the normal pillow and blanket.

It should act as a mock upper body for you to hug when you feel alone, or just to cuddle with when you go to sleep. Sorry if the instructions are poor, just ask for clarification in the comments if you need it.

 And nobody who consoles.

 And my heart is bleeding black.

Alright so I am stuck. I had been with my girlfriend for 3 years before I broke it off spontaneously as I saw her getting closer to another guy and the anger in me just boiled right up to the top. Now let me put a little bit of context to this story. 

Basically we were so close and thought we were going to be together ""forever"". We dreamt alot of our future together and all that cute stuff. We both come from different religious backgrounds and knew it'd be hard for us to be together but we were determined to make it work, even though we always knew of the possibility that we may eventually breakup. As both of us progressed in university, we started loving each other a lot, texting goodmorning/goodnights, having alot of fun sex, going out to eat, chilling with each other, and going on many dates. In her 2nd year of university she switched programs and got closer to a guy friend that she knew since childhood and started hanging out with him more. Through him she made even more friends. At the start I wasnt worried and had no problem with her being around him. I was never jealous of him because I knew he wasn't like me. However, soon it got worse.

She got him a job at her work place, which I was okay with. She shared secrets with him about her friends, and said it was because he'd understand better because he knew her friends better than me; I was okay with this too. As exam period began, we use to tell each other what we were going to do for the day, just a daily update kind of thing. She told me she was going to study, but three days in a row I found her going out with friends, including HIM, sitting right next to HIM, and enjoying. I was distraught on how she could not tell me she was going out. Plus she stopped talking to me for a couple of days, stating that she didnt want to bother me during exams. I was trying to study but just the idea of what could have been going on behind my back just killed me. She lied and was enjoying with another man. But they were just friends?

Now the insecurities and jealousy got worse, the anger boiled and I broke it off 2 weeks or so before her birthday. She said okay. She says she never felt anything for me when I brokeup with her because I had tried to breakup with her numerous times before because of petty arguments. Now this hurt. I went into deep depression. I still loved her and she wanted to get back together as well. However, we kept having mood swings, where one day I wanted her but she didnt want me, and one day she wanted me but I didnt want her. For her birthday, she went out with HIM and a couple of friends, wearing some revealing clothing which she never wore during our relationship, but did wear before our relationship.

Fast-forwarding, I begged her alot and cried for her to take me back (which I regret now because I seemed like a fool), told her all my insecurities and feelings, but she didnt want me. She went out with her friends and HIM, and they seemed closer than ever. It may have been my mind making me think this way but I couldnt stop myself. 

We tried to get back together multiple times but I just couldnt because she would act like she was the same old girlfriend I loved one day, and the next day she would go cold turkey. I made up my mind that I wouldnt get back with someone that didnt respect me, but I loved her. One time we got back together for a day or two as she was crying for me to take her back, and I told her she would have to stop going out with the guy so much (I didnt want to control her, but wanted her to atleast consider how I felt) but the next day she dressed up and went to his birthday party, and never even messaged me after I messaged her. I was so lost. I didnt understand what part of my feelings she didnt understand.

Another time she went to a school dance with him, with some friends tagging along too. He was so close to her, it was destroying me mentally.

Now, I was depressed for about 1 whole year after our breakup. Didnt have motivation for anything. Cut myself frequently, arms, legs, just to bleed out and stare at it with tears in my eyes. Use to cry all night into my shirt, drenching it with tears and snot, covering my mouth so no one could hear. Going under my blanket and screaming internally for god to kill me. Thought about suicide everyday. Couldnt eat for a couple of months and lost 15lbs. Laid in bed for entire days. I dont even know how I got through the school year as I didnt study anything and did all my essays the day before. Pulled allnighters for the first time in University and my grades were the worst. I kept stalking her social media accounts, waiting for a message, wondering who she was going out with. I wanted to see a picture confirming shes moved on and gone from my life. I saw how she took a picture with HIS hand around her waist (it was a friendly picture), and I was just disgusted and felt like shit. Then I saw a pic of her at a party with him and it just hurt. I was just a mess.

As of now I am doing way better. I started working out again, started getting some motivation to live again, got more spiritual, just starting to heal again. Went on no contact for a month or so. BUT THEN, she messaged me.

She got emotional during our texts and told me she loved me and needs me. I still love her alot but I know it wont work. Id just like her to move on now, it seems like im being a sacrifical lamb. She does make me really happy like no other person, but the fact that she cannot let go of another guy friend just destroys me. She seems like she has turned back into the person she was before our relationship. She is very social and beautiful, and i am an introvert, hence why I think alot. She called me a loner (I have 2 really close friends, and many many acquaintances/school friends), and a waste while we had an argument, and those words have just stuck to me and I cant get rid of them. They are somewhat of my motivation to prove to myself and her that I am not a loner nor a waste.

I know I shouldnt be controlling her life or of any future partners, and I do not want to. I know I have insecurities now and have lost alot of trust, also because she started hiding her phone from me when we tried to get back together. I have just stopped trusting anyone now. We have talked openly and she has said she never cheated on me. But I feel a bit betrayed because if she did love me she would have listened to me. It hurts that she still sees him and facetimes him (she says she facetimes all of her friends including him, but I know they have facetimed each other in the past). I cant get over the fact how someone so close can be like this. 

Do you guys think she betrayed me or if its just my thinking? How do I get out of this thinking, where I constantly find myself focused on her and what shes possibly doing, and if shes fcking him behind my back? She is my ex now, but it just hurts alot sometimes even though I want her to let go of me and I myself want to move on.  It really sucks because I know we both still love each other, but I do not see her as the ideal wifey anymore.

P.s. I blocked her. Should I unblock? loool",lonely,Betrayal or Not?,2020-04-23 02:22:20
840,AHandsomeFella,1587568899,5,"If you feel like this post is too big, you can just answer the question in the title, but I encourage you to at least read a bit of what I have to say.

I've been browsing this community for a while, and I see a lot of people saying they want girlfriends, and lovers, and boyfriends, I wanted to start a discussion about this topic because I think we should straighten some things out and understand this better.

A little bit about me first, if you don't care just skip to the next paragraph.

I've been lonely for a while, probably not as long as some of you, it's been 5 years since I had an argument with my best friend, and all my other friends left me because of that, I've been trying to get my pieces together ever since. Since then I haven't had any relationships with anyone aside from my family.

Where do I wanna go with this? Well, when I see these posts about people wanting girlfriends, I feel like they are searching for their solutions in all the wrong places. I know I'm not a role model, me searching for real friends has yielded no results at all since I started looking, but I feel like a lot of these people may be able to succeed where I am failing, they are just trying to look for the wrong thing. Girlfriends aren't the only people that can show you love! Real friends can be awesome! I know because at some point in my life I really did have real friends, the only thing that was capable of destroying our relationship was drug abuse, we had been through a lot together, it only fell apart because of drugs, (and a little bit of stupidity on my part also helped). Friendships are strong links, way stronger than most girlfriend-boyfriend link out there. Ask yourself, are you really looking for the right thing? Do you really want a girlfriend, or you just want someone to talk to, understand, care for, and care for you back?
Anyway, this is just my 2 cents on the topic, what do you think? Is my view completely wrong? Am I being an idiot? What are your thoughts on the subject? The whole point of this Reddit post is to encourage a discussion about it.",lonely,Why do you want a girlfriend?,2020-04-23 01:21:39
841,bad-herminone,1587568431,2,"not sure if this is the right subreddit... i¬¥m not professionally diagnosed with any mental health issue, i¬¥m just insecure about things so here we go:

1. i am apparently unable of taking a selfie
2. i check my appearence in litteraly everything that reflects my face
3. i never fight about anything, even if it's something that botters me A LOT
4. i let people hit me and didn't say anything
5. i cry EVERY SINGLE TIME i get ready to go somewhere like a party or a place with a lot of people
6. i can't wear any clothes that reveal my body / are tight, i mean, in my mind the world shouldn't see me at all because no one deserves to look at me
7. i can't wear bathing suits in front of people (bikinis?? what??)
8. i change my behaviour IMMEDIATELY when people say anything about me (e.g: ""oh you are so delicated and quiet, that's cute"" me \\\*acts in an extremely self conscious way to keep up to that person's stantards, even if i only saw them once\\\*
9. i always think about a mean comment someone made about me. even if it happened almost 10 years ago. even if someone else already made a complement about it. even if the person who told me it was a child. even if i was also a child when i heard it. (e.g: someone once told me my laugh was funny and i never laughed out loud again. i was 8. i'm almost 20 now)
10. i give up on things before even trying because i somehow know it's not going to work
11. i NEVER EVER EVER speak in class even if a have a question
12. i never made a friend by myself, someone always ""adopts"" and introduces me to other people
13. i NEVER sing in public ( i tried once and cried right after i finished and it happened in front of everyone in the church)
14. i hate when i need to make a presentation / speak in public
15. i can't make friendships last because i always think i'm bothering the person whenever they're with me, so i never reach out
16. i asked a girl who is a graphic design student to draw me so i could have a profile picture (professors at university really like a professional behaviour and apparently it envolves having your name and your face on everything you do)
17. i can't keep a conversation going on for more than 15 minutes without embarassing myself by talking way too much (so i act ""normal"" you know?)
18. whenever i have a social interaction i think about every detail of it and cry because i always say something dumb
19. i know i don't deserve the thing i have, even if it's a personal ""conquest""(is it?) like getting into university, i honestly don't know how it happened, i just KNOW i don't deserve to be there (not now because of quarantine but you got me), i honestly don't know what happened
20. i can't picture someone being attracted to me or being excited to be around me
21. i can't picture myself in any relationship because i don't know what about me would make anyone want to have a relationship with me
22. i am unable of having physical contact (where's my ""i never even held hands with someone"" crew?)
23. when people ask me ""where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" i don't know what to answer because i never pictured myself living that long, getting to my thirties will be WILD because i think the universe will see how boring i am and turn me into dust pretty soon (surprised it hasn't happened yet)
24. i know i will die alone, doesn't matter at what age it will happen, i know i will never be confident enough to have close friends or a family of my own
25. my only actual friend is my mom and i know she just wants to be close to me because of her ""biological duty of taking care of a life she created"" because i'm really boring, i know that
26. i never dance in public, and if i do, i regret it right after i start
27. i don't post anything on social media because i just think how people couldn't care less
28. parties? no thanks. even if it's my birthday or a celebration because i got into med school
29. i never express my opinions
30. can't talk in group chats (usually end up removed or get out of it because i know i'm just wasting the space)
31. i copy small things people i admire do so they can like me (e.g: i can act in loads of different personalities for days / weeks and change everything about me in seconds: handwriting, way of speaking, way of behaving, how i grip a pen...)
32. i always agree with what someone tells me, even if i don't
33. i know the world would be a better place if i didn't exist, everything would be easier for everyone
34. i try not to speak as much as i can
35. i hate leaving my house
36. i'm really good at doing things on my own - they always end up being a lot of crap, but at least they get done. well sometimes they do
37. one of my favorite activities is looking at the instagrams of the beautiful girls i know and cry while i do it
38. i never enjoy anything, it looks like i'm always waiting for things to go wrong because of something i did, usually i actually mess stuff up
39. i ALWAYS feel like i am bothering everyone around me
40. i get way too excited when people invite me to do something like playing games online because it almost makes me feel like i have friends (as always, i mess things up or say something dumb and leave in the middle of everything)",lonely,list of things i do bevause i'm insecure,2020-04-23 01:13:51

Do you know the meaning of searching for something to belong to because you don't have one? 

 You whoever is reading right now doesn't even have to do it. But here's a bit about me: I love movies and shows and I even watch foreign ones. I currently finished one show that was so good, but at the end I discovered something. Even though I am already aware of it, I just felt it even more. It was like a prick in my heart that it made me cry. It was the feeling of that I didn't have that  good gathering and feeling of being among people. I didn't cry very hard because I was afraid someone would come into the room and see me. And this mostly is the reason for me to suppress my tears and my pain in my chest all the time that it hurts too badly. I lie to myself that everything is OK and smile while I'm wiping my tears asking myself if I'm alright (I know that I'm crazy), but I know that I am very sad from inside. It is just that I know that there are people out there who are even in a worst situation than mine, especially with all what's going on right now. I know that whatever pain or loneliness that I feel right now is not at all the biggest problem in the world, but it never leaves me. I remember years ago that I felt it and it was not even that bad because at least I used to see the people I love everyday, but still I was like you'll end up alone and you should get to know yourself and be friends with it. Now I am OK with myself, but I feel a bit crazy because I actually find myself talking to it. I always hear people saying talk off your chest to someone, but i don't have a someone. I tried to be my own, but currently I'm very sick of it. Maybe I just need a break or something then I might return back. I just know that I'm too bad with people. I'm literally socially awkward.

I have some close friends that I play video games and go out with but they've never been the type of friends to have deep conversations with. Everyday I miss that interaction. This is mostly a problem just because I feel most comfortable talking to women when texting or talking a lot. I haven't had that luxury mainly because of a few things. For one, the major I'm in is 100% male so that hurts my chances. Especially at a community college where I'm not on campus a lot. Second, every time I meet someone on dating apps they eventually ghost or something else happens. This has bothered me more since we're in quarantine and I haven't had any matches in awhile.

I'm looking forward to the future though. I'm transferring to a university in the fall with a few friends and that should bring me out of my shell pretty well. It's a tight knit community and the program I'm in will be a lot bigger. Even though it's only about 3 months away from now, I still feel lonely despite being optimistic. I'm still really nervous about all of it though and that makes me miss having someone to talk to even more. It's strange.

We were really good friends like honestly I never saw him any type of way until..I don‚Äôt know what happened but we developed feelings for each other. I mean of course, I spent more time with him and his family than his gf like at church, lunch, bible study, etc. We had to stop talking cause our feelings were obviously affecting his relationship and I also did not want to be a home wrecker. He hit me up maybe a year ago and let‚Äôs just say, I was real lonely and he‚Äôs the light of my life. One thing led to another, we exchanged some dirty messages and the next day I never heard from him again. He recently hit me up and told me he recovered from the corona virus (he‚Äôs an EMT) and basically Caught up with me. Nothing happened really, conversation ended and it was casual. I feel he has a hold on me because we haven‚Äôt spoken since the last time he hit me up (1 week ago) and before that was over a year ago. If he talks to me it‚Äôs always for a second because I‚Äôm sure him and his gf are together and probably always will be. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I know what to do but I guess I don‚Äôt know how to apply it. I hate how he makes me feel weak because I don‚Äôt want any guy to know he has a hold on me. Sometimes I feel maybe he just wanted those naughty messages/pics. But what about the friendship? And the fact that he hits me up out of nowhere and just disappeared all over again. It just hurts because I‚Äôve definitely lost him as a friend all because we developed feelings for each other. This has been going on for the past 4 years of my life. Obviously I fuck around and have my own relationships or whatever but I mean the whole once-in-the-blue-moon confession of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my girl and at the end of the day you know my heart is yours‚Äù bullshit when all he‚Äôs doing is probably moving on with his life and getting his degrees to become a neurosurgeon because he‚Äôs so smart and capable and I‚Äôm so proud of him.

I made this decision when my ex cheated on me. I left that relationship in a dark place, i was distraught and vengeful at that point, it took me months to set my head straight. During this time i took a close look at the people around me. I started to see my friends motives for what they were, i didnt make much money but i made more than many of my friends at the time and it felt like i was being used for my money. I had recently been cheated out of 600$ after loaning a friend money. I had realized most of my friends were having a negative impact on my life. It was a hard decision to make when i decided to stop talking to everybody, i had known for months that i had needed to do this. But it took me that long to actually go through with this. I isolated myself, and really started making some progress in my life. I went through a series of new jobs each making more money then the last, i started renting a house. Started saving money for the first time in my life.  I really stared getting my act together, i really experienced being happy for the first time in a long time and it was a nice feeling. In this time i have searched for new relationships, and ive talked to and hooked up with a few girls i found very attractive and who i genuinely liked. I cant say why, possibly the betrayl i had experienced in the past. But i couldn't get close to them, or open up to them. I feel bad when they start catching feelings for me i dont know how to react. I feel bad for not feeling the same way. Its like i just wont let myself, so i try not to let things progress to that point now. I don't want to waste anybody's time. Although i am lonely and want to find someone i can open up to and grow with I just don't see that happenening any time soon. I continue to embrace my time alone and work on myself in a positive way. Step by step working towards my goals everyday. Somedays it can seem hard to do something meaningful, but no matter how small a step, a step in the right direction is much better than complacency, or worse a step in the wrong direction. I just try and take it day by day, and keep my head up. Its not always easy, i dont like to ask others for help, i just deal with the problems as they come up myself. For my future maybe one day i'll be able to find someone to open up to at the moment i just dont see that happening, so i'll just continue to work on myself in the meantime. 

And for the people of my past i truly do wish the best for them but i will not be crossing those bridges again.
i know my ex isn't doing well at the moment and that saddens me, i can tell she doesn't like me now. And i know reaching out would probably do more harm then good. I do wish her the best, and grows stronger through her endeavors.
And for the friend that never paid me back, i saw him at the gas station the other day i waved. He said hi it was almost like the past didnt happen. Though i will not be crossing that bridge again either although i do wish him the best as well.
And to everyone else i stopped talking to i hope your doing well in life. And who knows maybe we'll make some more good memories in the next life.

But for the time being i walk alone",lonely,Embracing loneliness,2020-04-22 09:41:46

My current roommate and I used to be inseparable best friends for a couple years, and have been roommates for a long time (close to 5 years). I used to be very naive - I didn't know how to set boundaries, didn't have the confidence to stand up for myself, and was too forgiving. This person is incredibly controlling, bossy, non-empathetic, and borderline narcissistic and I have endured what some other people in my life have titled her behavior as emotional abuse. I have only within the last year or so realized how detrimental this relationship has been to my mental health, self-esteem, and other relationships. Below, you will find text screenshots of three different situations (only a few of many) that have happened within the last year and you can observe how she acts towards me and vice versa. I will also note that one of the biggest fights we have ever had is not captured because I was so upset and distraught that I deleted the entire text conversation and can't find a way to recover it. Summarized, she became enraged when I told her I was going on a date with someone (who is now my SO of almost a year). She told me that I was depressed and lonely, and that I needed to get the idea of being in a relationship out of my head because it wasn't ever going to work out. I had spent two years prior to this being single and working a lot on myself and furthering my career after struggling with anxiety and some depression.

Situation 3: I had recently got a full time, salaried position in my career field after working in retail for nearly two grueling years. She was upset that we couldn't ever hang out, even though we lived together, watched TV together, made dinner together, but would never try to make plans with me outside of that. So it's my fault.

That's not me being a narcissist either but that's besides the point.

I've always been the wierd kid in school, always silent, not really paying attention in class, and always drawing in a sketchbook. I never had anyone tell me that I wasn't wierd before but at this point, I've grown used to it.

Let me tell you a story:

One day at lunch, I was drawing ideas for an animation I was making for my channel, one of the characters would need a really old gun (pirate shit) so I started drawing flintlock pistols, blunderbuss cap guns, muskets etc. 

Then, a girl sitting at the table I was at, (in my school you couldn't really sit by yourself) was the one girl that everyone seemed to love and hate, the drama starter

She saw that I was drawing a pretty bitching drawing of a blunderbuss and she started yelling.

SCHOOL SHOOTER! SCHOOL SHOOTER!

And went to every table that didn't manage to somehow hear her and tell everyone what I was doing.


I think within that moment that I was given the label of ""school shooter"" and that was how I was gonna be seen for the rest of the year.

I tried explaining to everyone why I really was drawing it (because of an animation I was making) but no one listened to me.

Long story short, after that day I never brought my sketchbook into school again and a few days later, the coronavirus happened 


When I was called 'school shooter', that was the day that I realized that I didn't need friends until late high school or college and that I could just be independent because of how cruel and mean kids my age could be without knowing the true light of what happened.

On March 13th I kicked off my 5 song EP release by dropping the title track, ‚ÄúSolo Dolo‚Äù.

This song is about the lessons I learned while being independent.

Doing things alone isn‚Äôt always the best.

When I wrote this song I wanted the lyrics to remind people:

We all need a support system, a friend - a mentor.


For too long I stayed ‚ÄúSolo Dolo""

(solo¬†on the¬†down¬†low)

aka

an ‚Äúindependent loner‚Äù

Thinking it was healthy living

This idea is what inspired every song on the EP and why ‚ÄúSolo Dolo (Healthy Living)‚Äù became the name of this collection of music.

There are definitely ups and downs when it comes to being independent - my hope is that this music highlights the universal truths of the matter.

966,GlitteringVegeta,1587460630,1,"Hi everyone. 
I made this account specifically to post this today.
My boyfriend 26m and I 26f have been on the rocks for some time. Been together eight years with two children.

Probably ending the relationship as it looks like we want separate things. I want to keep a happy family and save up for a property, family holidays etc. So he suggested we move to his Mums to save up money for this reason. Since we've moved in he has changed. He goes out at all times of the day and night and stays out for hours on end. He lies to me about where he's been. I've also found out from him that he's been purchasing pain killers illegal in this country. I guess that explains why he just slept all the time whenever he came back. He shouts and swears at me when I ask questions, he does it in front of my kids. I feel so sad for my kids. I just want them to be happy. 

I've been with him since I was 17, I thought he was my soul mate. He was my best friend. We did everything together. He tells me everything is pretend and he never feels happy around me but plays games with me. It feels like he only wants to bother with me and kids when there's nothing better to do. He has been so spiteful and has done everything possible to push me away. I feel so alone and isolated here. Even after everything I feel like if he wanted to try again I would take him back, I love him and want to take care of him. But feel so embarrassed in myself for letting him hurt me over and over again. I just want everything to be OK and him to be happy and actually love me. 

I am alone in my head, I feel almost broken that I can't escape this situation. I wish he would love me again. I have no family apart from my dear elderly Nan. I feel so alone and anxious.",lonely,Feeling alone after codependent relationship finishes,2020-04-21 19:17:10

970,Limon27,1587457147,1,"I have a wonderful and supportive family and life gave me a lot of people that trust me and have called me a good friend. I value all the love and warmth I have received. I have got so much and I have had the opportunities to have even more. Perhaps that is why I grew to be lonely, because I have been overwhelmed. And at the same time, I feel guilty and somewhat ungrateful, for I know there is a lot of people that would rather be in my shoes.

However, it is the truth and being so close to my 26th birthday I have finally realised and understood the joy that being alone brings to me.

A lot of things have happened to me this year, but I want to share the one experience that brought me to this conclusion. My first girlfriend. I met her in a dating app and she is one of the best persons I know in my life. In fact, that is the attribute that attracted me the most. She is such a good person, with great values, pure soul. Such a wonderful person, I didn't deserve her.

I was her boyfriend for about five months, we met last year and broke up in March. The time I spent with her was wonderful and being with her actually motivated me to exercise more than usual. But the more time we spent together, the more I started to miss my solitude. I was not missing playing, for we played together; I was not missing writing, for we wrote together; I was not even missing watching football, for we watched it together.

I was actually missing being alone. Holding her hand felt nice, but not being held somehow feels nicer. Her hugs were so warm and lovely, but in a strange way they were suffocating me. For a moment I almost blamed her. Perhaps she was being cloying, perhaps she was giving me too much too quickly. But no, she did everything right. She was a good companion. And I want to think I played my part well too.

So even though it was my first relationship, I don't believe it failed or somehow it developed wrong. We genuinely had a good time together. It is just that... It is not for me. For some time I feared that I was going to die alone, but now I realise that that ending is not bitter or fearsome, but colourful. I have meditated for so long about this and the conclusion is, for me, undeniable. My path of happiness is lonesome.

Understanding this, what I believe to be truth, has allowed me to enjoy my life even better. Now I can talk to strangers without imagining how our lives could be together, because I don't want to be together. Now I can go to sleep at smile at my small bed, for that is the perfect size for me. I had shackles made of questions, wonders and possibilities, no more. Loneliness was never a demon I had to defeat, but an ally to embrace.

It feels so good to be alone.

So, I have a message to you, lonely reader. Two messages... A promise and a warning. Make efforts to understand yourself and become the person you want to be, life has many obstacles and they are not meant to challenge you, life is what it is, whatever it is, it is up to us to find our motivation that will push us forwards. However, be aware of the darkness, for its cold embrace can damage you and drown you without noticing until it is too late. Do not be alone for the sake of being alone and do not allow loneliness to be your graveyard. While it can be a powerful friend, it can also be a nasty enemy.

My truth is not necessarily yours as well. Explore the world, search withing yourself and follow your heart. What you are looking for might be by your side right now... Or not.

Thank you.",lonely,I feel happier being alone,2020-04-21 18:19:07

981,pawelbrzl,1587447919,1,"Life... it passes quickly. When you are between adolescence and being an adult, things go by so fast that you become afraid. Not being prepared for the responsibilities, the maturity and the new outlook on life. From a young age, our parents are responsible for teaching what is right and wrong, where these values ‚Äã‚Äãare challenged and even changed in adolescence, where it is a phase of new discoveries. We fight, we argue with our parents, receiving punishments, where they want to impose what is right and show that this is the way. The truth is, we don't have to fear failing, reflecting, trying again. This is the same when we are in a bad time, falling a thousand times, but still, lifting a thousand times. Life is a roller coaster of emotions and lessons, just living and going through all the difficulties and never giving up is what makes us stronger and more capable. Don't be afraid to change, to be a better person, to do differently, because tomorrow you may regret things you have not done in your life. Life is short, but if you stop to think about so many things we have learned, most of the lessons do not come only from good things, but mainly from bad ones, we learn a lot more from our mistakes to seek to be our best, so don‚Äôt have fear of living and making mistakes. Human beings are always looking for happiness, many of them in something material and forgetting feelings and emotions. Money does bring happiness, I would be a hypocrite if I didn't say it, but it is not everything. What is worth if a person has everything but at the same time has nothing, empty inside? We have to be more humble, patient and help others more so that we can learn to love more and especially love ourselves more, express your love, your happiness and enjoy life, don't be afraid to make mistakes and change for the better.

Hey, recently my life feels so chaotic, these couple of days have been difficult for me mentally, and now I think I lost my only friend. 

We know each other for almost 8 years, ever since I came to UK. We were always very close, and both respected each other and nothing was ever wrong. After I left my other best friend that was very toxic we started to hang out more often and I think that's the problem. We started to see each other every single day, she expected for me to call her at least once a day, or talk to her for 2 hours straight while she's going on a walk (when I have better things to do), she expects me to do whatever she tells me to. She's basically starting to become like my old best friend that tried to control me and manipulate into doing things that are in her favour. She thinks I don't know but I exactly know when she's trying to manipulate me. Few months ago I noticed she was stealing from me, she stole my expensive headphones and makeup, she was always lying herself out of it when I once confronted her about it, she actually got very mad at me but I should be the one being mad. Once she even made a theatre acting like she found them next to me when in fact they were mine. I was honestly shocked when I noticed she's been stealing my stuff, I let this girl live in my house and god knows what else she stole from me back when I didn't notice. 

She lost respect for me. She basically thinks it's okay for her to shout at me and embaress me in front of people. She raises her voice at me and always over reacts with stuff, if that was me she would just laugh at me and not make a big deal but with her, she over exaggarates whatever I do. If I stick up for myself I basically lose her and I have to apologise because she won't take it. She always has to be right, she's always the smartest one and I'm the ''retarded one'' as she always calls me, even though she knows it upsets me (she knows my ex bestfriend was calling me that all the time). She always says how toxic and horrible my old friend was but now she's acting exactly like her. 

She thinks I'm so stupid, whenever I say something that's on my mind or that's actually true of course she has to be right and says how stupid I am or just stares at me with blank stare and gives me a dirty look.  She also has zero trust in me, she doesn't believe in me, she thinks I'm a dumb failure when she didn't even pass a single subject. She always has something bad to say when I talk about my accomplishments.

I can't even be myself anymore around her, I literally have to watch what I say because she will make a big argument out of it. I always have to talk and smile because she will get mad at me that I'm a dead company (I feel depressed at time I can't control it but she doesn't understand it) . The atmosphere is so different than what it used to be.

She talks about herself ALL THE TIME. When I say something about me she doesn't listen she just continues to talk about herself and I have to listen because she will get mad at me. 

I really can't do anything here. If I stick up for myself I will be all alone and with my poor social skills I will be alone forever. I think she will still talk to me to use me for me to get her dog back (her dog is at my uncle's house and he doesn't want to give it back to her). She's literally my only way to going out to gym, and just to be social overall. I have nobody. She will never be alone but I will. Everyone loves her, even though she's so fake. She just always licks everyone's ass and buys them shit so they like her, I'm always nice and I'm always hated my everyone. She has no problem being cool with people that talk shit about me and she always listens to them trash talking me but she never stick ups for me.

I did/do so much for her. She even lived at my house for free when she had nowhere to go. I was literally the only person that was there for her and she treats me like trash now. I thought she's the most important person in my life and it's crazy how much and how quick she changed. She really wasn't like this before, her ego changed her. Too much attention from guys/''popular'' kids. I'm her slave, if I don't do as she says she will leave me and she knows damn well I'll be all alone.

Today she called me and she was going for a walk so she wanted me to stay on call for her for 2 hours, but she said '' you know that you're going for a walk as well right'', (I would go by myself, we dont live close to each other so idk what's the difference for her) I basically told her that I just have stuff to do, I had to help my mom and clean bathroom and she told me its bs and said ''do your makeup right know put your clothes on and leave, now. She told me that like twice and when I started to say that she cant just tell me what to do she hung up. She texted me a paragraph how I dismotivate her and to stfu about my insecurities when I'm so lazy, and of course she told me I'm lying as always. 

Today I realised, even if I will still be friends with her, I'm officially alone, with her or without her. She actually makes me feel more lonely and really hurts me with all the stuff she says, I was literally crying for hours after she hung up to me. It just made me realise that nothing changed in my life, people are still leaving and still turning against me,treating me like trash. I'm just so scared of being completely alone, I wont have the courage to go gym, college and my life will revolve around my room. I'm so heartbroken. I'm just scared to stand up for myself because I know that if I do I won't have any friends. I basically allowed her to treat me like this. I just feel so alone now, I thought I cant cry anymore but today I couldn't stop. I don't know what I should do, I didn't even open her message. 

She basically got angry with me because I didn't do something I didn't suddenly ran and left my house on her call to do something that wasn't in my plans. The thing is she's not like this with anyone, just me. It's ridiculous but it really hurts me, she just has 0 respect for me.",lonely,I'm losing my only friend,2020-04-21 10:51:17

Most of them didn't want to know me anymore after I fell into depression-- I managed to get over the worst of times with distractions but I feel like I fell off the treadmill with life in a big way. 

I made a few online friends and things have gone sour a few times. At one point I was in a fandom, lost interest in the topic, boom, friends didn't want to know me. Countless times I tried to be proactive and make friends with people but they weren't giving me much back, some were totally rude for no reason! I went to a concert and was going to meet a few of them and they kept lying/changing where they were so I couldn't meet them. I made a couple of friends in the line but it hurt my self esteem a lot.

It's so frustrating. I don't know what is wrong with me to have had people scorn me so much. I keep good personal hygiene and brave myself to be bubbly and friendly even when I don't know people. It's not that I feel entitled to friends I just don't understand why it's been impossible to make any. I feel so hated by the world I just want to stay in my room and wither away.

My heart is full of love, aching to be released from my lonely chest. To find someone to be given to. It will never happen, I know it. I'm struggling to accept it, but what else can I do when my past relationships ended up so badly and are...

Nevermore.

&amp;#x200B;

I have so much will to live. Will to experience life at its fullest. So many dreams and desires to be brought alive, to make them beautiful and special. It does not matter. Because they are all...

Nevermore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm full of thoughts and ideas, ready to be shared, to be expressed. So many of them, glorious, innovative, unique. Yet no one will ever know about them. My will to bring them into the light is...

Nevermore.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I am still here, walking amongst you. My loneliness shall remain unbroken and with it, my soul shall be lifted...

Nevermore.",lonely,Nevermore...,2020-04-21 04:55:14

1049,AnonymousAmber,1587396278,1,"Good Morning Everyone! This quarantine SUCKS. Has totally put a damper on my life and goals Ive set for 2020. The beginning of March started out lovely. I just moved out of a shitty apartment situation where I was living alone in the city and moved back in with my Dad to help him around the house (my mother passed a few years ago.) I got a new job, alot of my friends still live locally so I had a really good plan of action with turning my life around for the better.  


Welp the quarantine stopped that. Im obviously stuck at home and Im not feeling as connected with my friends as much as I was hoping, (mostly because our conversations are now purely text messages, Ive never been a huge fan of phone calls, which is now totally biting me in the ass.) So Im looking to broaden my relationship hopes more.  


I am looking to speak with someone around my age, females mainly but guys I dont mind as well, (Im not looking for a relationship but also dont mind if something happens.) I really ultimately would just like to just talk to someone everyday that can check up on me and vice versa and a friendship can ultimately grow.  


I dont mean to be ageist about this, its just what I prefer as Im hoping to meet someone that I can be friends with for a long period of time, and this is why location is important to me too because I would love to eventually be able to meet as well. After messaging me for a bit, Id really like some proof of who Im speaking with. Im not in the mood to get catfished, just be honest about who you are. I promise, Im being honest about who I am. I guess a short videochat would be ideal but we can talk about that when the time comes.  


Just to point out some of my interests. I love to read, watch movies and tv shows. Horror is my favorite genre. I love to laugh, so if you can do that, we're golden. Im pretty introverted but am extremely extroverted when Im comfortable with someone, ( I note this because my friends would NEVER think I was introverted, but I REALLY do enjoy my alone time.) I work in media, (artist,) but have recently started a new career in regards to making more stable money. Im pretty spiritual and healthy, (and you dont have to be, its just the path Im currently on.)  I used to party alot when I was younger and in the past maybe 5 years, really dwindled down. I drink occasionally but really prefer a soberish lifestyle.  


If you sound interested, please feel free to hit me up. Leave a message and tell me about yourself.&lt;3",lonely,"33/F/NY --Looking for sometime to talk to, similar age and area",2020-04-21 01:24:38
1050,oriku101,1587395983,1,"Just a quick note. Hopefully it can be helpful to someone.

Since starting the quarantine, I've been feeling pretty lonely, to the point that the things I usually love doing stopped being interesting, especially since there's no one to share the positive emotions with. Remembering that that is one of the first signs that my old nemesis, Depression, was readying to surface once more, I did my usual anti-depression routine: heavier than usual exercise, meditation, fasting, etc. One part of my routine is to watch one of my favorite movies, but just as I was getting ready to watch a movie, I thought I'd give Reddit a quick read.

I found a thread in the Horror Movies group that had people wanting to watch movies at the same time as others. I chatted with a guy/girl from Australia and we agreed to watch Doctor Sleep tonight. And then we did.

It was really nice to know that someone out there was doing the exact same thing I was, and I was really looking forward to chatting about the movie after it ended. 

We chatted. We had the same thoughts. I felt a connection with another human and it was wonderful refreshing.

Loneliness... gone.

I have no idea who I watched the movie ""with"". I don't know his/her name, what he/she looks like... I just know that we both love horror movies, and I'm thankful that he/she exists.

Thank you, Reddit, for existing. I wouldn't have experienced this without you.

1051,toppedwithgarlic,1587395930,1,"I moved right around in the middle of December and at first I was okay with the move; I did know that I have to make some major changes to my routine, but I was okay with it. I didn't really have any string feelings towards the move, or the house that we were moving to, or to a new community, a new neighborhood. 

The first night I couldn't sleep since it was so quiet, I've lived in like the city *city* my whole life, but... We had to move to another city because at the time my mom was about to get married to her boyfriend, and they decided to move in with each other. The thing is, his parents have to move in with us because his parents were kicked out of the house for construction purposes of the new landlord. 

Haha anyway, this house was a  bit of a commute to my high school. It didn't bother me to wake up early since I'm up at like 12 in the morning, but I have to wait for my step-dad to pick me up, but he gets off at 4:00 and I get off at 2:20, and my little brother gets off at 3:50 in his middle school. So we've decided that I wait for the car ride in Mondays and Wednesdays, and take the public bus to the mall transit center to get picked up on the rest of the weekdays. 

These little things start to get annoying, I start getting a little irritated. (But I've always been irritated haha) And the things that are going on in my life aren't helping the situation, like stuff with my dad, keeping up with junior year, and now this whole quarantine is making me realize that this house doesn't really feel like home.

I googled what a home should feel like, and it said that it should feel like being wrapped up in a blanket after playing outside on a cold day. It really doesn't feel like that, I feels like I'm crashing a someone place.

1056,ltpcel,1587391645,1,So with the Covid 19 epidemic all classes and social events were cancelled so I (22M) had to move back home and end my final year early without the chance to have a send off or say goodbye to friends. The thing is for my 3rd year I had a year abroad so the majority of my friends from 1st and 2nd year graduated and moved away so I had to try and make friends again for my final year which I did with two of my flatmates but that fell apart after Christmas because me and one of them started a sort of relationship but it didn't work out and I realised I didn't want to be just friends with her and she never really made too much of an effort to be friends with me. So to not go crazy I joined a uni club which went well and I met lots of cool people there who I became friends with. However obviously I only had a max 5 or so months with them and they all had other friends that they were closer with so I knew it was only really a temporary thing just so I wasnt entirely miserable during my last term. Then the coronavirus pandemic started and everything was shut down and I had to go back home which kind of made me feel depressed because I never got to say goodbye to anyone and we were planning a big end of term party. Since I've moved back home no one has really reached out to me which I understand why because I'd only known them for around 2 months but I feel very lonely luckily I have my family and I feel very bad for those who live alone during this. I fell out of contact a bit with my old school friends since I started uni and I get a lot of anxiety texting people first because I feel like I annoy them and they don't really want to talk to me. I know I need to get back into contact with them since I'm probably not going back to uni so I need friends at home but I feel it's a little pointless because I'm not gonna be able to see them in person for a long time however I am feeling lonely.

1058,Nooblious,1587391194,1,"This is a message for you, for those who are still fighting, for this struggling to hold on, for those who needs to believe. I am going to share the stories of my own, and I know this will be helpful because I‚Äôve been here before. 

I tend not to share to much with strangers, but I know you are brothers and sisters fighting the same war.

I grow up being rejected from most people, as friends and even with girls. Everything stoped when I stoped trying so hard, I was true to my self, and now I have a lot of friends. But yet still I felt like too much of a coward to ask any of my crush out, judging on my looks and experience. Every night is like a torture to me, I would...well seeing that we‚Äôre here...pretend to have a gf, and we all know how that goes. Any chance to a relationship to a girl I would grab on, but most of them ended up rushed and creeped out, I am not proud of that. I was devastated.

And then one day, I met a girl at this camp, it was only two days, so I guess I could pretend to be someone that I‚Äôm not, for some odd reason, I was one of the guys, if not the guy that has all the girls attention. I was funny, nice, and confident, I didn‚Äôt have anything to lose, and being at the wonderful camp, there‚Äôs zero time to think about how miserable I was. Anyways I was able to impress most of the girls, but there was thins one girl that I took particular notice. She was very nice, cute and probably the funniest girl I‚Äôve met. So I asked for her number, and we talked after camp was over, funny enough, she asked me out (not dating) I agreed, though she lives on another island. Things escalated, and three days after I asked if she wanted to date me, and she said yes. 

She was everything to me. Everything. Though she‚Äôs really, really busy being a school model, swimming, band, and everything else, we still talked everyday, through FaceTime or just texting. And being the guy that was lonely for his entire life, I naturally put too much into her, too much to pull out. One day, and I mind you this is shortly after, she told me that she can no longer bare it anymore, she couldn‚Äôt see me because of the the time, the distance, and her parents. She said that she could bare not seeing me anymore, and that the pain is effecting her life too much. I was completely horror struck, that night was the worst night of my entire life, I‚Äôm pretty sure I was suffocating, it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a expanding metal ball in my chest, I thought of killing myself. But I held on, because of a promise that I had with God, I told him that I would hold on because I know that I can trust him, that he answered my called when she came into my life. Still I struggled, we became just friends, and after a while things seems like it‚Äôs going to be bearable. Until one day I crossed the line and suggested to be together again. That was the biggest mistake of my life...she blocked me out completely.

It‚Äôs been a while now, for most of the time was pretty much normal, infancy better now that I don‚Äôt do desperately want a gf, but this whole quarantine business...and this video... let‚Äôs just say I was constantly reminded. But even though it was painful being lonely, it was nothing like being dumped, but at least it wasn‚Äôt constant. 

I sympathize with everyone here, none of you are creeps, I get how it feels to think that you‚Äôre going to die alone, and the thought of a gf is laughable. I don‚Äôt blame anyone to doing anything (just don‚Äôt hurt anyone). People say that we are losers, creep, and fucking scum of there world, but I know better...I know that we are soldiers, holding the fuck on. Those people had it easy, they was born with ‚Äúcourage‚Äù, but let me tell you what true bravery is, it is the very thing that dances with hope, it‚Äôs is the core of your existence, it‚Äôs is the very reason you are here today. You held on, you‚Äôve won every night, alone, by your self. It‚Äôs fucking overwhelming, but you held on like a man. Sure, you cried, but isn‚Äôt that what makes us human? Isn‚Äôt that the very thing that streams through your vain? The very essence that powers, fuses and the very thing that gives you strength? DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT YOURE A SOLDIER!? You‚Äôve won the battle that killed our brother and sister, the ones who gave into the fear, so won‚Äôt you fight for them? Won‚Äôt you fight for your future? WONT YOU FIGHT, FOR HER? Because i know she there, even though you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been though it all, and it is not with sheer luck that I had a gf, it‚Äôs is because I held on long enough for me to find her. You never ever know who she is and when she will come. It is no matter if if, it‚Äôs is, and I repeat, a matter of WHEN. 

So for those of you who had the heart and soul to read all of this, congratulations, because this is the manual to get a gf. Hold one, be true, and mean while, enjoy life, because you‚Äôll only have it once. Work on your self, for her, do everything in your power to make sure that when she appears, you will be there, wrong as eve you can be. Because one day she will come, oh yes, she fuckkng will, because you‚Äôve won the battle. 

There will be those who are not your final partner, but merely armor that requires you to kill the bosses. They will hurt, oh yes beyond anything you‚Äôve ever felt, but just like always, you will hold on, because you believed. And when you see her, you will know, that all is won.",lonely,A message of Hope,2020-04-20 23:59:54

I ( from Belgium) feel lonely and I live in a place where there is nothing, not even a bakery or something. So quarantine or not, nothing changes for me. I have no social activities excepted school where I don't have a lot of social activities either. It makes a long time that I haven't got real connections with someone (as friend, nothing more).

I am quite afraid of people but on the other hand I want to be friends. I am a only child and I don't have so much friends in the same passions. 

I am passionate about Python devloppement and open-source software as well as music and ecology. I know it's not really the kind of stuff that is common, especially where I am.

I followed this one girl on Twitter a while back (before the lockdown began) and we started talking casually. I thought it was weird because, honestly, I have no idea why anyone would want to talk to me in the first place.

I always get attached to people so easily, especially when they're showing slight ""signals"" that they might _actually_ interested in talking to you. 

But then I started thinking that it's the lockdown and people are bored... And people will talk to anybody when they're bored. I might be overthinking this way too much, I'm a definite overthinker, but it just bothers me a bit. She'll message me during the late hours of the night, I'm guessing she's just bored during those hours or something.

She'll message me, I'll respond and after 2 or 3 messages, I'm ignored for _hours_ like I'm nothing. I don't know. I just may be nothing to people and people will just step all over me.

First, it was the regionals. Everything postponed and cancelled. Then it was school. No more high fives in the hallways or dicking around with drones at lunch. Then all the plays.

I am not very lucky in achieving help such as Social Security to Unemployment. To Food Stamps to Food banks. To quarantine to roommates in a one bedroom apartment. To keeping it together to wanting to scream my body apart.

A wanderlust at heart. My first wandering away was when I was 18, freshly out of high school, decided then to move to Arizona with a guy who I fell for. He was my first. And to this day, still my last.

Being inside had made me curious about the ways to move again. Maybe with a little bit more of a challenge. Maybe out of country. Or back to the East Coast. The whole being employed has been a bit more hard now that I wear my hearing aids more often now since my latest hearing loss. I haven't before and that was also the time I had two jobs. 

On top of it all, I am just not so sure how to see past the moments I am living now. Is it supposed to be this hazy? Not knowing? Is this normal? Or am I, like everyone say, delusional? Why must it be a bad thing to be honest?

I was looking at Portugal last night. Daydreaming through the night at the idea of getting away from everything that I ever know, things that are lacking me or letting go. Truth to be told, I still lose everyday to something because I truly believed that it wasn't meant for me here, that I wasn't enough to pull through the denials or the pushing aside for something more. 

I flushed my anti-depressants back in February. I did my withdrawals. I focused on the picture I had in mind. I had ideas of how I would want to write, to share. To go places that I want to see and possibly live. That is until the virus outbreak and on that same day, my trailblazer had a flat. Coincidence?

I've read books and watch videos about getting friends but it seems that I can't make it work, most of the time people just don't care when I try to just talk with them.

If I can't experience it, at least I can watch other people enjoy having friends.

1112,hamartiated,1587350422,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-20 12:40:22
1113,definitelynotareddit,1587346809,1,"
Today (forgot to mention she is my coworker and every workday I have I see her) after a long day of work and having little moments of flirtation with her I decided to just see it as her being friendly. After work, I went over a friends out for a quick workout session and on my way home I got a random wave of sadness....making me wish I could spend just one more day with her....I have the urge to message her and ask if she‚Äôs ever down to hangout like we used to. But then again, something tells me she doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me(after all she said she found someone else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), but the way she treats me at work makes it seem like she still wants me in her life in some form, she‚Äôs occasionally trying to start small talk with me but lately I‚Äôve just been very dry in my responses to her. She‚Äôs very playful with me and it just makes me think 
‚Äúis there still a chance to have fun with her....?‚Äù








Background info:


Recently I left an odd relationship where I was (to my knowledge) led on and basically used for emotional/sexual comfort. From the very start she told me not to expect anything/she didn‚Äôt want a relationship and I totally acknowledge this, however I ended up catching feelings and eventually she ended up breaking us apart, saying she found someone else that she liked a lot

At first I was really devasted, I was constantly thinking ‚Äúwhy/how did this happen...out last date seem to go so well‚Äù and just kept replaying our hangouts over and over trynna found out where I went wrong. After 2-4 days of me doing this I got over it and decided to focus on myself a bit. 

It‚Äôs been roughly one month since our last meet up (actually one month and a day).",lonely,Random Wave of sadness just hit [rant?],2020-04-20 11:40:09

(This is my first time posting and my first time ever really using reddit, so please bare with me.)


Ever since quarantine and social distancing started, me and my friends for around 5-7 years have fought over a big misunderstanding.

Basically my 2 ex-friends didn‚Äôt approve of me liking our mutual friend‚Äôs ex-crush. Even though I talked to our mutual friend if it would be alright for me to pursue her former crush, she supported me and gave me her best wishes. However my two (now former) friends told me to not believe what she said since it‚Äôll hurt her ego. So when our mutual friend came up to me about her problems, she opened up on how she was disappointed in me for not telling her about how I could possibly like her former crush sooner and later on, mentioned my former friend‚Äôs name in disappointment. I took that as an opportunity to ask her if what they said about her was true (since I really didn‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings and wanted to really make sure). I did tell her beforehand that I didn‚Äôt mention them and what they said out of spite or whatsoever, I just wanted to know if that‚Äôs how she would feel (since they knew her so well as much I did). I realized that what I said hurt her and I kinda regretted saying it (even if I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt anyone).

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I did realize the gravity of my words once I said it, so I did say sorry. I know people might say that I should‚Äôve just trusted her, and you all have a valid point. I could‚Äôve just let them say what they wanted to say and just trust her word. But I didn‚Äôt, because of the fact that I was worried that what they said might‚Äôve been how she really felt. I know maybe telling her wasn‚Äôt really the optimal choice, but at the moment, I felt like I wanted to be honest and know where everybody stood in the situation, most especially my friend‚Äôs feelings towards her former crush. 

Eventually, I told one of my former friends about me telling our mutual friend about what they said since I wanted to reaffirm them that our mutual friend is okay with it and that what they said about her ego and feelings won‚Äôt get hurt. However, it became some misunderstanding that apparently, I wanted to cause drama wherein they thought that I wanted our mutual friend to confront them about they said about her and her ego (TAKE NOTE: these ex-friends of mine REALLY value our mutual friend‚Äôs judgment on them... It‚Äôs always been like this since high school... unhealthy I know). 

Ex-friend 1 and I talked, and I said sorry for everything that might‚Äôve offended them and we were okay (but things changed when ex-friend 1 talked to ex-friend 2). 

Apparently ex-friend 2 asked for info from our mutual friend about our conversation beforehand, and because our mutual friend can be neutral, she said things in a ‚Äúas-a-matter-of-fact way‚Äù (she left out personal stuff she told me since mutual friend said so herself that she trusts me more than she trusts ex-friend 2). And because of what she said and how much she left out, ex-friend 2 thought I lied about my intentions, that I said what they told me so that I can apparently get our mutual friend to look at them in a bad light or as the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù. Which was never even my intention in the first place!

Basically both of my former friends were talking and thinking that I conspired for our mutual friend to basically hate them. And I‚Äôm really hurt and so frustrated by it. We‚Äôre growing up, we‚Äôre no longer in high school... yet why does it feel like we never left? 

I know I‚Äôm perfect, and I know that I could‚Äôve just kept quiet. Maybe some things are truly better off unsaid. Yet at the time, I really wanted to be an honest person, with no spite towards anyone. It just hurts me how the people I thought who knew me the most, can see me as someone I‚Äôm not.

This hasn‚Äôt been the first time they misunderstood me and my actions, and heck, maybe this was a sign that they‚Äôre toxic friends? I just felt like I gave so much love to them, didn‚Äôt get mad at them for misunderstanding me and gave them the benefit of the doubt for many times already, yet only for them to take it for granted when they wanted to. 

Now both of them have not talked to me, they unfollowed me and I just decided to deactivate since this problem + more personal stuff have been really affecting my mental health. As for my mutual friend, I know she technically didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, but I decided that maybe it‚Äôs best if I just didn‚Äôt talk to her too (I will talk to her again eventually) to avoid further misunderstandings. I know it‚Äôs unfair that I‚Äôm probably not talking to her, I feel bad about it too, but I feel like if I‚Äôm not comfortable talking to her, knowing that she‚Äôs talking to them... Idk I might suddenly say something that could cause an issue unintentionally (TAKE NOTE 2: me and my mutual friend also had a big falling out in high school, but we slowly repaired that since the beginning of college almost 2 years ago. I started to trust her again recently but this issue is making me feel like I can‚Äôt trust anyone).

Bit of an embarrassing post but here we go. 

So I'm in my mid 20's (M) living in Glasgow, Scotland. As the title says, I don't have any pals. Used to have a good group of ""friends"" from secondary school but that almost immediately fizzled out after school due to defending my now wife from that group picking on her all the time. That was 8 years ago. Been on my own since then really. 

I've tried socialising with colleagues in work but never seemed to connect with them all that much to warrant hanging out with them outside work. 

I suppose eventually I'd love to have a little group or circle of friends of my own. Being out the game for 6 years though I'll probably find it quite hard getting into the swing of socialising but I'd love to try and give it ago.

To make it even harder, I don't drink either so I guess pubs/clubs are out of the question? Been quite hard finding people that also aren't interested in going out and drinking all the time.

This girl called me on the phone today to talk about the assignment and a little later she said something very unnecessary, insensitive and rude.

In the following months I joined the Army and graduated made some good friends. Now I'm at my unit and deployed. And I'm just as if not more lonely as I've ever been. I'm a pretty shy person and really self conscious. So I avoid going up to different women and trying to make small talk. And if you know Army women the majority of them are unfaithful. 


And online dating apps are a dead end for me. They usually lead to being left on read or conversations that slowly die. My friends back home are always busy and rarely if at all text me usually only texting in response to me. Nothing against them they're just more interactive if I'm around them but unfortunately I'm five thousand miles away. Which leaves me pretty lonely. And now to get to the main point. I often find myself wanting to talk to my ex even though I know she wants nothing to do with me.


I also know she's manipulative, verbally abusive and cruel. But that doesn't stop me from wanting to talk to her or develop some sort of friendship. I know a relationship is out of the picture and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want that anyway. I'm not sure if it's because of desperation or loneliness. But whatever it is it made me reach out to her about a week ago. To surprisingly positive reception at first but quickly died out rather quickly. I was left on read multiple times and ultimately ghosted. 


It left me feeling extremely pathetic and depressed. But I should've known better and have know one to blame but myself. And I still find myself at times wanting to talk to her. Even making excuses for what happened like I used to when we were together. I just want someone to love and that loves me. Someone to talk to after a bad day at work which is often for me. Someone I can tell anything someone who can hold me. 


Someone who wants to talk to me and I don't feel like I'm burdening with my presence. Sometimes when I listen to one of my roommates who is one of my best friend's. Talk to his wife I become jealous of what a beautiful relationship he and his wife have. I'm ashamed and embarrassed that I feel this way and wish them nothing but the best. And then my other roommate who is engaged.


Dose nothing but talk to other women and try to have an affair. And it infuriates me to no end that someone could do that to someone that they say they love. Sometimes I want to tell his fiance what he's done but it's not my place. It's just that I Know what it's like to have someone who says that they love you and then they talk to other people. 


I don't know I just wanted to get this off my chest I'm too embarrassed to talk about this with my friends. I know they won't laugh at me or anything but I still don't want to say anything. Which brings me to you kind people I'm glad there are communities like this.

1143,-Lazzy-,1587322485,1,"Hey guys. So, this quarantine made me think a lot about my life lately and I decided to put my thoughts into words. I don't have any friends so I decided to post this here.
I am a 2-year college student and I've been able to keep my grades up on a passable level for some time. 
However, this semester is different. I started skipping classes and ignoring my tasks rapidly. I skipped several weeks of college just before quarantine was issued in my country.
I didn't do any studying from home either and I've been skipping online classes for several weeks as well. 
Previously, I was studying lazily, but I was still able to force myself to binge at the last moment, do tasks at 3 a.m. and so on. 
But now I can't force even open up a textbook or look up what my homework is. Whenever I try to do that I just can't. 
And so, I've been doing nothing but watching, playing and reading for about two months now. I completely rely on my mother when it comes to housing and food. In fact, I've never worked in my entire life. Our family is in a lot of debt and all of it will eventually be mine to repay. It is quite worrying.
It's not like I don't feel guilty. I do. A lot. However, whenever I think about my real life and how to fix it I immediately sink into a depressed state. 
I'm a fat, dull and emotionless person. Furthermore, I'm very introverted, to the point that I find it hard to engage in a daily conversation with people even if I'm aquatinted with them. 
Finally, I don't have any friends right now. I've had them in highschool but my relationship seemed to drift away from me until it was almost non-existent. I didn't have a decent conversation for a full year now that I think about it. 
Whenever people approach me it seems like they are very far away from me. They always talk about things I don't have any experience with. I can't start (throw my self at) a conversation without cracking some stupid joke. I try very hard to keep the conversation going but can't do that after all. 
And so, I think my current situation is pretty bad. If I don't try my hardest in the next semester I will drop out of college (I decided to give up on this semester for now). ""Relaxing and taking a break"" doesn't seem to work for me (it makes me even more lazy). Whenever I try to think of my problems I sink into tears or force myself to sleep. 
I think I should go to a psychiatrist or someone like that but I've never been to one and I'm a little bit afraid. I think that the only option that can help me right now is antidepressants. I don't know whether it's a good idea but it's better than nothing. And so I've been waiting until the quarantine will be over so I could go. I hope it will be over soon.",lonely,I am afraid of slowly becoming a NEET with no friends and I don't know what to do,2020-04-20 04:54:45

TL;DR
Was alone, somehow made friends, crushed on one of them, she got together with someone else in our friend group.

Some background:

I‚Äôve been lonely for years, at one point I managed to make some online friends, and now...well you‚Äôll read below.

A little over half a year ago I dropped out of uni. (Starting a new course in September though, there‚Äôs still hope for me.) Now I only had some online friends and my retail job to get me through the day. I went up to my manager and told him I could work more hours and I now work there full time. I got assigned to morning shifts. There I got to know some people and even somehow managed to make ‚Äúwork friends‚Äù with some others on the morning shift. You know, those people at work or school you‚Äôre friendly with but you never really meet up outside of work. A couple of months down the line that changed and Girl, Boy1, and I did some stuff outside of work. We had a little friend group and a couple weeks later Boy2 joined in as well. 

Over the last couple of months I had started to crush on Girl big time. We worked together a lot, we talked, we laughed. Maybe I just can‚Äôt differentiate between having a girl friend and wanting someone to be my girlfriend, but no matter because I was crushing. 
She knows I walk my dog all the time and one day she suggests we walk our dogs together. We do, we have a nice time, it‚Äôs great. 

Around this time the corona stuff starts happening in my country and our group of friends can‚Äôt really properly hang out anymore. You can still get together with 3 people or less though.

At the start of this month my workout app gave me a challenge to walk X kilometers this month and in a group chat with Boy1, Boy2, and Girl, I asked whether anyone wanted to go on some walks together. No one responded at first but the next day Girl messaged me. She said she‚Äôd like to come along on my evening walks with my dog. I agreed and about two weeks ago we went for an evening walk together. We talked, laughed, gazed at the starts. It was just great! And this was all with the girl I had been crushing on! We walked together every evening that week about 90 minutes each time! This could actually go somewhere!

Then came Monday evening of the next week and we both had to work. We didn‚Äôt feel like walking afterwards so we skipped a day. Then the next day came and both of us kind of forgot and as it was already late, we agreed to skip another day. Wednesday evening I had work until late in the evening and we skipped another day. The next day she saw my message asking if she wanted to go for a walk too late. Then she didn‚Äôt feel like walking. Long story short, we didn‚Äôt walk together this week (today is Sunday of that week). However Boy2 and Girl has been going on walks in the afternoon this week. I ran into them once and a friend of ours ran into them once. Since I was crushing on Girl I did feel a sting in my heart but it‚Äôs cool I thought, she can go on walks with her friends. 

Then about an hour ago Girl and Boy2 sent a message in our group chat. They‚Äôre officially a thing now. It hurts. My heart hurts. Especially when it‚Äôs two friends of yours getting together. I want to be happy for them but I just feel really sad. And now I have to act happy for them. I sent a happy message congratulating them but I just feel horrible inside.

I really thought this could‚Äôve been it you know. That maybe she could like me back, and that maybe, for the first time in my life, I could openly show my love for someone. Better luck next time I guess...

I‚Äôll see Girl at work again on Tuesday so let‚Äôs hope I get over this by then.

I get that i should man up and just deal with rejection but now im just sick of it because i have been rejected so many times , its almost embarrassing. 

I just ant a girl to show me some affection. It does not have to be sex necessarily but i just want a girl to cuddle with, kiss, take a walk in the park, talk about life  ,and do other stuff.  

I have visited 2 strip clubs and i didn't find the affection i was looking for. I do understand it isn't the strippers fault or the strip club's fault. I also understand now that the affection i was looking for can't really be bought with money. 

Sometimes I think about getting an escort. The only thing that is stopping me from getting an escort is high prices they set (+600 per hour) . So until i get a job that pays really well, this will not b an option for me.

I know this sounds really dumb but sometimes i will think about the idea of dressing up as a pretty looking girl and think that it will all of the sudden make me feel a little bit better.

1166,Difflock123,1587300699,1,"Although the ‚Äúalpha‚Äù male is not a myth, a specific form of it is often prescribed to by lonely men. They commonly believe that by being as physically and socially dominant as possible that they will be treated with respect by other people and no longer be alone.

This isn‚Äôt entirely untrue, but it‚Äôs important to note that the efficacy of this strategy is very dependent on the situation and the social group. Simpler groups, often composed of younger college students or teenagers, will be easily affected by this. There, dominance and respect often is almost entirely determined physically and socially (you may say ‚Äúof course it is social, they are members of a social group‚Äù, but what I intend to say is that their competence elsewhere is less of a determinant factor).

I propose that social status (and thus a decrease in loneliness- because we must face that social status is one of the strongest determiners of our ability to make romantic and platonic relationships, especially within larger social groups) is often increased by our proficiency or competence within specific multiple areas. If you are good at math, excellent. As you reach the end of high school, many will realize that your math ability will take you far in life in fields that actually matter. Although it won‚Äôt automatically make you attractive or high status - nothing will - it does provide some measure of baseline respect from other people.

What I hope to convey by this is twofold. First, being proficient has the power to improve your social status and make you no longer lonely if you are a man. This applies especially to unattractive males because it provides an attractive characteristic- if a man is competent he is much more likely to attract a woman because she knows that he can support her financially. Social status isn‚Äôt just a brutish Neanderthal fest. There is some nuance provided by the modern world. Second, you truly must come to terms with the fact that no one cares about you as a low status male (outside of close family, if you have them). It is incredibly hard to increase your status if you are at the bottom. If you have decreased social status within a group and hope to increase it again, it will be much more difficult the second time around. What you have to realize is that competence is your saving grace. In a modern world, your survival can depend on it. Count yourself lucky you are not fighting with Neanderthals, but at the same time recognize how primal tendencies are blatant determiners of our lives. Loneliness is something to be ashamed of because it indicates low status, and if you want to escape you should never admit to it. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much hardship you have been through as a socially isolated individual, because it is undeniably true that no one cares. Work hard towards proficiency in something that matters and it will be your salvation from pity.

1171,mystwave,1587296832,1,"No doubt in my mind would say I'm not lonely. It used to be when I was in school that I fooled myself into believing I wasn't lonely. I truly convinced my own self that my loneliness didn't exist and that I was fine. But enough lamenting about the past. Afterall, no way I can travel in the past and slap the shit out of myself for thinking that way among other regrets. 

Anyway, I've reached a sense of complacency. Sure it might be depression or whatever other infliction one may wish to call it. I wake up, take a shower, go to work, come back home, eat some dinner, and watch youtube/browse the internet, and go to sleep. On my off days, I couldn't careless about my sleep schedule. I mostly just spend time at the computer. Sure I may take a walk on a nice day or see a movie in the morning that's been out for a while, but chance occasions don't make up for the days where I just spend my free time at the computer. 

I just don't have much interest, let alone motivation, to do things. I'm just living life day by day because I just can't see the point in doing much more. I just want to work to make enough money and seriously hope that this year I don't need to use my savings towards my health or my car. I won't lie, I';; be blunt. I hate living in a world where I must work just to survive the basics of rent, utlitilies, food, and the internet. I'm only here because my family for whatever reason needs me to keep existing even if we rarely interact.  

Nonetheless, I'm just going through the motions in life. These are stressful times, and it's made work especially stressful. Yes, I'm still working, but despite being so stressed at work, nothing is different in my life. Sure I might go to the store less, or omit seeing any movies, but still. Nothing's really changed. 

Like I said, day by day. No one wants to be with someone like that, irl. I mean, talking to my siblings and dad is just small talk anyway. Not much going in my life means that's all I have to say, and I know they understand I'm not much of a conversationalist...but my family already accepts me cause we're family. 

Part of me wishes life would just hurry up and end. I've loneliness my friend. It's been with me all along like a companion in disguise. It's always there, but I accept them because it's all I have. I've convinced myself that I can live a life of loneliness, and I'm living proof of that. I'm fine with it....always have been.",lonely,I'm fine with it?,2020-04-19 21:47:12

Now, I'm making efforts to meet new people and make new friends. Fortunately for me, I'm finding it to be relatively easy to form acquaintances (as easy as it could be for someone without much initial socialization practice).

However, I'm finding a common theme: None of the people I'm meeting are even remotely close to being very relatable to me and it results in the connections feeling fragile and weightless. Anyone else experienced this or something similar? It feels like I don't even have one close friend because I can't relate to anyone I know on a deep level, and that being friends with myself is my only option at the end of the day.

I‚Äôm turning sixteen and I‚Äôm 6 foot and 120 lbs. I eat more than my fat dad so it‚Äôs probably something with my genes. I talked about it to my parents but they just say every time that I‚Äôm normal and than my dad was skinnier than me at my age and that what matters is to stay healthy( my dad was raised in a poor african family and had nothing to eat most of his childhood so fuck what they say).I asked my doctor but she just said the same annoying shit: stay healthy :). I asked my uncle who‚Äôs a professional in the human body shit and nutrition but he just told me that what matters is to be healthy, first of all, fuck health if I cant beat the shit out of people, and also, how does body health matter more than mental health? I just released some of my inner hidden hate, I just feel like worthless shit ,even tho I started working out, my muscle mass keeps going up but extremely slowly.

About me:

- J. Cole the main light source in my life. I'm for real, I'd be much more numb and incognative to my thoughts if it wasn't for him. 4 Your Eyez Only is my favourite album, such raw thoughts n ideas yet so developed. 

- I write music of my own, heavily inspired by the aforementioned. I'd be sure to show you some if you'd wanna see. Nothin to listen to tho (yet). I mainly do it as a form of self therapy, it's unreal for that. But it also allows you to confront your own thoughts in a way that I feel is unparalleled.

- Tech n Gaming is another huge hobby of mine. My room's defo a testament to that lmao.

- I draw obsessively, drawing is another form of therapy for me. So rewarding, in my younger years it was Lego.

- Here's what I look like:  http://imgur.com/gallery/4E1vKCN

Have you ever been in the situation where you don't text your friends to hang out with you, because who would wanna hang out with you? 

Have you ever failed a test because you panicked becaue you taught you didn't have it in you? 

These are just two simple situations to which everyone can relate. I know the second example doesn't really have to do with being lonely, but not succeeding at school is definitely bad for your mental wellbeing. 

What if you did have the confidence to text your friends? Or the confidence to go out and meet new people? 

I'm wondering what you guys think about the role confidence plays in our lives. And please do link me any studies  about self-confidence and the effect on life.

I'm 22, 5ft7, 60kg, study Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), and live in central London.

As far as my personality is concerned, my female friends have always said that I'm quite cute, charming, loving and affectionate, so I'm hoping that's your cup of tea! I have always been quite sociable and popular throughout life, but deep down, I am fairly shy and introverted. I'm quite fun and enjoyable to talk to, however, so I'm sure we'd get on just fine! :)

In terms of my interests, I thoroughly enjoy reading books on philosophy, history, and economics, as well as non-fiction and detective fiction. I also like travelling (lived in 9 different countries till date owing to my dad's job!), discussing politics, following all kinds of sport (especially cricket, football, tennis, chess and badminton), spending absolute hours on good old YouTube, doing loads of window-shopping (I've always had a habit of trying on *reeeally* nice clothes, but hardly ever purchasing them!), playing the piano, listening to a lot of music (primarily EDM, classical, and folk), going on lovely long walks, watching plenty of documentaries and films (mainly comedy and romance), cuddling, and so much more...

I enjoy trying out and doing a wide variety of things, so I can almost guarantee that I would have great fun doing a hobby of yours that is not mentioned in the list above! Just try me! ;)

On that note, thanks a lot for taking the time to read my post! I hope to hear from you soon :)

Then I graduated school, which meant that I didn't see my friends everyday, the only time I would see them was at parties. This was fine however since I had my girlfriend to talk to and hangout with, but recently we broke up and I've now realised that I'm completely alone. Everything I used to have is now gone. I always had many friends and usually a best friend, I would see them everyday at school and play video games with them on the weekend. But now  that I don't play games anymore and I'm single, I have no one. I still consider these people to be my friends but I'm not close with any of them. If I initiate a conversation or ask them to hang out then they would, but none of them would message me first.

1276,Revathy_Rupakula26,1587201098,1,"Why there's always a need for us to constantly think about one thing that didn't work.. why is that I brace myself so hard and finally reach a point where I can assure myself I am not breaking down..

Why do the nights remind me of the guilt, regret and sorrow that what time I have invested in a person now, none of them even have a second to spare for me... 

I can't blame them, it's not right on my part, I can never bring out XYZ things to prove that I did for them and by default they should be with me, I am not up for a trade..

My feelings would have no meaning if I went back and begged them even though they don't want to listen to.. I can't keep knocking the same door again and again thinking this time it would open. 

That door was closed and is closed and I am not the one who is an expectant entrant, as I sit beside the door to open, it won't open though I keep knocking it, because it's locked for me. 

How much ever I try to break in the door it won't break, few things can't be broken, you might break yourself in this process but the door nor the other side would be, that's how we end up in this illusionary world

For few it's a dexterity to just move on from you, because not always people seed plants with you, with an intention to grow them with you, they seed it and leave, you can't keep watering it and expect them to return, they had a plan they did their job and left 

You might keep giving the sweetest of the sweetest fruits to them but remember you are left with the bitter ones, they might enjoy the fruits, you can't blame them because you are the one who is still watering it..

It rains, outside as well as inside, but there will be sunshine, provided you open your windows, no one is going to do that for you.. your limbs might become numb and you might get cold.. but you should be the one to open the window.. 

Hunger, Sleep, Happiness they might not matter you much, you either do it too much or not at all, there would never be in between but still remember, you are the one who is getting effected at whole... 

Though the feeling might be magical, happy, content not always what you give is what you get, the real feeling is when you see the same favour being returned to another instead of you, you might tear out and run behind... 

You end up in circles of chaos, and that's how you keep falling apart from your life and yourself day by day... 

Tears rolling down on the cheek is just the proof that I regret, I never say that you are bad, it's just that you never found me good enough for you... 

I can't question you nor can condescend about that to you, because at the end I stand as none for you where you are everything for me... 

Promises and words might reverberate inside me, but you are happy over there right, it's just that I am no more part of it.. 

I leave this writing here..as I have an ocean to cry I might not let you know, or let anyone know about this, it's a close secret between my pillow and me, we were together since long, probably the only cloth which bore most of my tears....

i hate drama but everyone has always pulled me into it some how and make me seem like im the dramatic one. it usually doesnt bother me bc ive had other friends who understand me and ive moved on past that. but it just rlly bothers me bc it feels like ppl dont like me when ik that‚Äôs not true. ik im a good person/friend and i just have a big heart. so the little things ppl say rlly bother me.

anyway, the point im trying to get at is ive never rlly had a friend group. i was always just friends w ppl in other cliques but never was in one bc they had all been friends for so long and never rlly took in other ppl and bc they always had drama and i was just sick of the negativity. that was hs tho and im hoping it will get better in college. i havent found a solid group yet but idek if i ever will? i feel like ive been traumatized by my old friends and i find it hard to trust new friends bc im afraid theyre just going to end up treating me like how my old friends treated me.

1295,MrUnknown1996,1587187274,2,"I‚Äôm 23(M) and I have never been in a long term relationship before. I have plenty of lady friends and I have even been on a few dates over the past few years, but nothing has ever materialized in a long term relationship.

For most of my life it has felt like I have never had time for a girlfriend. Before I graduated High School I was always involved in a lot of other things. Boy Scouts, Sports teams; and probably the biggest time consumer was tutoring and spending all hours of the night doing homework (I have a learning disability). 

I thought that things would be different in college. But I got really busy with my school work and spent a lot of my time studying, so I didn‚Äôt have time to meet anyone new. For a while I considered online dating, but for a while I was reluctant because I was worried about what my family would think (I later found out they wouldn‚Äôt have cared). 

Eventually I gave it a shot and that eventually materialized in the only date I ever went on in college. With the amount of messages we sent each other and the fact that we went on a nice date, I guess you can say she was technically my girlfriend. But maybe not considering that was the only date that we went on, we messaged each other some more after that and I tried to plan a second date before we both mutually decided to break up. 

She was a single mother working two full time jobs to support her kid, and I was a college senior trying to finish my degree. So I guess you could say that the odds were stacked against us from the beginning. 

Soon after I graduated and started my first post college job. I decided to take a break from online dating until I get accepted to graduate school because my job involves a lot of traveling and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to start a long distance relationship. I tried, the whole prospect freaked me out, I wasn‚Äôt really ready for it. 

All of the travel for work, my failed attempt at a long distance relationship, and my reminiscing on my past has made me feel incredibly lonely. What makes it even worse is that I am getting rejected from the grad schools that I applied to, there‚Äôs one I haven‚Äôt heard back from yet.

1320,LazeFox,1587167098,2,"Hello. First of all, I'd consider this a phase of mine. I happen to let out most of my feelings on certain occasions, and they simply overwhelm me. Pay no heed if you'd like to avoid reading some fool's banter.

I'm still fairly young, and thus inexperienced. As a result, I tend to make some awful decisions which I, to this day, regret having made. Toughing everything out is what I normally do, I never reach out for help, and I simply try holding back tears whenever they well up, even if it's rare for me to do so. 
My past has been somewhat rough, I'd call it. My mother conceived me with a man she had an affair with, and we used to visit him up until a few years ago when he suddenly disappeared. It's not that I hate him, I wouldn't even say that it lies that heavily on my mind, but it's just that I can't tell anybody about anything really given that society perceives most things as unethical. Since my parents (stepfather and mother) usually fight every day, though, it's not all too serious as violence is not involved, I'd like to move out in about a year once I finish school. This quarantine, as well, is just adding to the already existent pressure on my chest, and not being able to talk to my friends isn't improving the whole situation. I know, none of this is really severe, but I felt the need to cry out for once. I wouldn't ever decide to pester about it in the presence of my friends. I'm there to provide a shoulder to cry on, people don't expect me to cry all by myself in bed. All they probably see is some boy, who allegedly is happy 24/7 when in reality, I'd just want to drop everything, say ""fuck it"", start a new life. This post is already turning into a jumbled mess haha. Anyway, all I'd like to say is that I'd want to receive a heartfelt, warm hug. If that is too much to ask for, I'll simply wait and work towards a better view of myself.

Thank you.",lonely,A hug is all I need,2020-04-18 09:44:58

1323,cloudcrossing,1587163849,12,"I‚Äôm sorry in advance for how long this is. I‚Äôm sorta writing into the void.

When I was in elementary school I had a best friend (E) who I was attached at the hip with. We were so close, then my family moved away when I was 10 and I forgot her birthday that year. She called me up and said she was hurt I forgot her bday. I tried to backtrack and say that she never gave me the chance to, but the truth is I forgot and she knew that. We never spoke again. 

When I moved to the new school, I became best friends with a girl (B). We were also very close and she had recently stopped being best friends with a girl that same year. I should‚Äôve known I‚Äôd be next. When we got to middle school, she decided I wasn‚Äôt cool enough and friend dumped me. She harassed me online and in school and we were no longer friends. In high school I found it in my heart to forgive her again, and we were in a fairly large friend group. She then proceeded to turn every friend in the group against me and kick me out of the friend group. I had two friends for my entire freshman going into sophomore year, and through the summer. I‚Äôm still coming to terms with the fact that technically, I was bullied by someone who was supposed to be my friend, and by those other people who were supposed to be my friends too and chose to not speak to me for no reason. I still to this day don‚Äôt know what I ever did to her to deserve that. 

As this was going on, as I mentioned above, I had two friends. One of these was A. I considered A my best friend during all of this because she stuck by me, and was always listening to me, giving me a shoulder to cry on, etc. Maybe I put too many of my issues on her. But I always tried to be a good friend. The only thing was, A was very flaky. She‚Äôd only respond to my messages every couple of months‚ÄîI understood she was busy, but I felt upset that I wouldn‚Äôt hear from her for months at a time. When I tried to ask her about this, I guess she felt cornered and that I put too much pressure on her/our friendship because she ghosted me. We went to different high schools so she never had to see me. I haven‚Äôt heard from her since. 

My second friend during this time was S. S‚Äôs family took me in like their own. I felt so understood and supported there. But S and her mom had severe bipolar disorder and I witnessed a lot of traumatic things while there. At this time, S was a little selfish and wasn‚Äôt the best friend. I put up with it for awhile, but eventually we grew apart. 

After this, during my junior/ senior year of high school. I was friends with C. C was and still is someone I really care about. Our boyfriends were friends and we met through them, &amp; we had art class together. We became very close but she was going through very rough issues at the time and her life was becoming chaotic, and I was being dragged into it. I supported her through everything, but once I started to get involved in the drama I knew I had to distance myself, but I did the cowardly thing and ghosted her for a month rather than have an adult conversation. Eventually I apologized and we talked it out, but I regret that to this day, because our friendship was never the same. We keep in touch, but we aren‚Äôt as close. I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend of the time bc it was a toxic relationship, so I saw her even less, especially because her bf and my ex are best friends. Because of this, I also wonder if secretly they are actually against me because of what happened with my ex. I miss her but I accept I fumbled that and did exactly what was done to me in the past. I should‚Äôve known how that would feel. 

Since then I‚Äôve been ghosted by my most recent close friend because I argued with her over something stupid and instead of talking about it, she decided to end the friendship. I guess I got my karma, and I‚Äôm not innocent in that situation, either. But now I have nobody. 

TL;DR: I‚Äôve lost every close friend I‚Äôve ever had, because of cruelty and circumstances beyond my control but also because of myself, and my own self-sabotage. 

I‚Äôm lonely, and I just feel unlikeable. There were cases where things were my fault, but there were also times where people just didn‚Äôt like me because I guess I‚Äôm just not likable, or forgettable, or annoying, or weird, or some mix of all of those things. I‚Äôve never ‚Äúfit in‚Äù anywhere in my whole life. I‚Äôm now 20 years old and without a close inner circle of people I actually trust. I don‚Äôt have friends who I can just call up, or go out with, or even just have someone to talk to about the things that go on in my life. Everyday I‚Äôm filled with negative thoughts about myself. If someone out there feels this way...you‚Äôre not alone. I just pray that one day I can finally have a friend in my life that I won‚Äôt lose.

1335,ItzTimbitz,1587157942,0,"Hey guys! So a couple of days ago I've made my first post on here, I was really down hitting rock bottom. I've had a serious emotional breakdown that day because I just felt like I was useless and worthless and just didn't fit in anywhere. I've had a tough time sitting home all day and ""working"" from home since I never really have a lot to do but I at least had a place to be when I got to the office. My life never felt so empty after the first week of home office. Most of my life I've been single and people kept asking me ""how are you single?"" and I never knew how to reply to that because it wasn't like I wasn't trying. Now that you know what really got me down to this point I'll come to the uplifting part. A day after I've made my first post here a really nice person texted me and we like instantly clicked. We were like joking around a little and found out that we have basically the same interests. I know its a little early to say that I want to be with her forever but we both fit together really well. After unsuccessful 6 months of ""dating"" on tinder and not meeting anyone decent just some random girl starts texting me without any real intentions on my side. I mean what are the odds that this happens right?  


Here is my theory: If you keep your options open fate, god, karma, the universe, whatever you believe in will make it happen. You are not alone with your sad feelings and bad past. There will always be someone who is perfect for you and who will work together on your issues it just takes time for everything to work out the way it is. Don't ever rush into things but if you have the feeling that something is just really good go for it. If you make mistakes or mess it up just think that it might be meant that way. Even if you lose someone there are always people that got your back even if you can't see them you'll find them where you haven't been looking.  


I hope you all are going to have a great time and I just want everyone to remember that nobody ever is really alone with anything. We live in a big big world with many ways to connect to eachother, you can do everything with the help of the people that got your back.

Hey I‚Äôm thinking about starting a group chat for people in their 20‚Äôs - early 30‚Äôs to kill some boredom through lockdown so we can make some friends and acquaint ourselves with people across the world.

General idea:

- share in each others culture

- talk books, tv shows, gaming, etc.

- share memes and pics and videos

If I get a good response I‚Äôll make one but I think at least 10+ would be needed. If anybody is interested either comment or dm to let me know.

I also have another ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that I KNOW is toxic, and I‚Äôve known this for over a year, but here I am, still somewhat regularly talking to him. I keep talking to him for a multitude of reasons: I hate hurting people‚Äôs feelings and will go very far to please people, I have low self esteem so if this is the best interaction I can currently get it, I guess I‚Äôll accept it. It‚Äôs also hard because one day he‚Äôll treat me like absolute shit but the next he‚Äôll act like we‚Äôre best friends. He shares my private information to others, insults me (what he calls teasing but he very obviously strives to actually hurt me), etc. He‚Äôs always liked finding out exactly how to push people‚Äôs buttons but he especially goes hard on me. And one day I can promise to myself that if he ever talks to me again, I will confront him and tell him everything on my mind. In the end, though, I always sigh and act like everything is normal. Cause it really does feel normal, for a bit. You know, I laugh at his jokes, we‚Äôre having fun, until...it starts to get bad. My least favorite part is how he always manages to get me to do what he wants, which I guess I can‚Äôt blame him for since I‚Äôm kinda a pushover. It‚Äôs just frustrating to see him being all cocky and assuming he‚Äôll get his way, and it‚Äôs even more frustrating when I inevitably succumb to his wishes. 

But... I‚Äôm lonely. I literally had a dream of me just cuddling a random person, and it was the highlight of my week (lousy alarm clock ended it though). So I don‚Äôt really want to lose more friends since they‚Äôre limited in numbers. Ughh. I also know ‚Äúconfronting‚Äù him won‚Äôt do anything, I‚Äôve done it before.

1380,NOT-JEFFREY-NELSON,1587102493,2,"I want to preface this by saying I am mentally healthy, and extremely headstrong. I am not at all considering any type of self-harm or suicide, I just want opinions on how I feel.

Recently, I've been feeling what I normally feel after long periods of being alone. Loneliness. However, this time it's different. It is the same feeling as loneliness, but it feels more physical. Physically sickening in fact.

It's so incredibly difficult to describe here. Hopefully one of you understands what I mean. I understand the stereotypical feeling of being ""empty"" inside, but in this instance I can physically feel the loneliness to an extent I find concerning. I have been reaching out to people I haven't talked to in years in an attempt to speak with people... to converse. This, however, has proven ineffective. It's difficult for me to reach out on Reddit of all places, but I am curious if other people experience this feeling.

I have been lonely many times in my life, but after this period of extended isolation due to current events, the loneliness is near-physically debilitating. What's worse, it makes it more difficult to have legitimate conversations with people because I think I come off as craving conversation. It's all so hard to describe. My mind is diving into other people's minds to try to simulate what their thoughts would be on if I contact them, how to effectively talk to other people, etc.

It's almost as if I am a recovering addict and I am craving my stimulant, but my stimulant was conversation and people. I know it's a horrible comparison, but that's the extent of my desperation. I was **never a social person to begin with**. I am quite introverted, but I am not at all shy. It's just that this isolation is starting to get to me, especially when all other avenues of curing my loneliness have largely failed.

Am I going crazy, or is this just how extreme loneliness feels? I feel almost physically sick from it, despite knowing that it's all in my head.",lonely,Extreme loneliness?,2020-04-17 15:48:13

1390,FalseSand,1587100288,2,"This might be long:
The past 2 years the nawing feeling has become more noticeable to the point today it became obvious as I came to this subreddit. 
5 years ago in my senior year of high school I became good friends with a girl who later asked to be my gf when she went to boot camp and I went to college. This I knew at the time wasn't a good idea but I was being hopeful. The first couple years I tried to keep in contact but she would respond after days, which I understood she was very busy. It came to a point where I accused her of not trying and she apologized and there whole thing became uncertain. I became a person who I would hate and hope to never see what I wrote to her. That fizzled out after we didn't talk for a year and assumed we were done.
After another year a became close friends with two friends from our friends group. Since most of the people we knew graduated we're the last of our group. The two have been a couple for a few year and I third wheel them but it didn't bother them and they always had me over for dinner. Seeing them made me happy but after I go home the itch starts to happen. Recently one of them got sick and was in a coma for a month and has to wait till next semester to graduate. She worrys she won't mentally be able to finish as she gets confusion and difficulty remembering. My other friend and I are still cool and I help him in one of his classes but since quarantine I'm home alone a lot.
This whole story leads to today where a few hours today I got on Facebook after years of not being on I see the ex says she has a feance. That just just hit me weird as I haven't thought of her in a long time. 
Everything felt annoying at the time but school and friends had my attention but now not being around people pulled the feeling the front. Did I always feel this? Do I have any right to complain? Is it more depressing using Reddit to talk about this?  Am I sad or am I longing?  I guess I needed to get this off my chest.",lonely,I might be lonely,2020-04-17 15:11:28

1392,hamartiated,1587097383,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I started school not really knowing anyone and I‚Äôm bad at making friends (social anxiety, shy,etc.). When people get to know me they say I‚Äôm kind and funny and really talkative and so on. I just get really scared of people judging me so i end up hiding my personality and blending into the crowd. 

I really just feel alone. I hardly text anyone anymore and have been feeling really down lately. I haven‚Äôt gone out in so long. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm so desperate, I‚Äôd rather have fake friends than none at all. 

Before the pandemic happened, I used to want to always stay inside and would dread seeing people. Now I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve really taken the ability to do those things for granted and I should have tried to be more out there. I wish I had tried to make more friends and stopped hiding in my shell.

I even used to have a friend who I constantly had on edge that I would stop having as a friend that always seemed to ask me for guidance because of his anxieties.  I dumped him after college because he seemed to be more aggressively and sort of bully me and say strange things like I made you or I just want to keep pushing to test the limits of our friendship.  

There was the passing little things.  Then there were the big things like a sort of bf I had in college.  Long story short I denied him what I offered and the relationship seemed to evaporate.  It wasn‚Äôt much of a relationship anyway since we didn‚Äôt really hang and only talked at work.  Sometimes he would even bully me and once told someone within earshot that he hated me.

1412,Velitar,1587076922,1,"TL;DR
Sometime it feels like I want and love thing I can't have. 

Sometimes I feel like my whole life is just some cruel joke. I realy like physics, I always did. Since like 5th grade I dreamed about visiting college and studying physics. I really sucked (and stil does) in mathematics but I was like second best in class in physics for whole elementary school, so I thought it would be ok. Later I went to grammary school where 
everything was harder and my grades from physics dropped. Now I fullfild my dream. I am studying at university in neighbouring state and I realized that maybe I don't have what it takes to become physicist. I stil can understand like everything, but the mathemarics is really hard and sometimes I feel like I can't solve more complex problems. I think most of the people here are really briliant, they can solve everything, they have great grades and so on. My friend swhom I met here also got an internship after first year. Now is my second year, fourth semester from six. I am still hanging on but I don't know long I can last. I am repeating my second subject, which I thing I will fail again. All of it makes me little bit depressed and worried. I fell in love with physics and I don't want to lose but I thing I will. 

Also my social life makes me sad. I was loner in elementary school and still it is little bit hard to make a friend for me. All the harder find a girlfriend. I am 21 and had not been in relationship because like to my 18 I cold not find courage to ask someone I like to date. Now it is better and in first semester on party organized for physics studets I met a girl whom I fell in love with. I tried to ask her out but she was like only girl in her ""class"" (she is studying astrophysics) and there was a student who was really sexist and he wanted her but she hated him and she was sick of men because of him. So I tought I should wait and we became friends. Later he dropped out and after some time I asked her out but she said that she has no time. I thing it was true but I also took it like she is not interested. It hurt, still it hurts because (as a friend) I asked her if she want to write a comics with me (she is really good artist) and she agreed but every time we met for discussion she seemed like she was in hury and so on. Now I thing she is avoiding me which makes me sad. But I am not surprised, I am not someone handsome. I am skinny and almost bald. Anyway I tried to move on. I met a girl from lower grade and I think it looked good. Even we went to date! But she did not pass last semeater and she lives too far away. I was really hoping for the best. 

Now I am home because of the pandemic, studyng from home overwhelmd with homeworks and I fear that I can't handle it. Also I can't go see other people and I am thinking about the girl I fell in love with and that she does not like me in that way. All of it makes me really sad. But maybe it shold not, that is life and maybe I am just a cry baby.

I suffer with depression and anxiety and it‚Äôs tore my life apart. I crave human interaction, but I‚Äôll never initiate conversations with anybody. Phone calls are persistently rejected unless they‚Äôre from my family. 

At Uni, I never made any friends. I remember during every seminar I‚Äôd sit by myself listening to the other students‚Äô free flowing debates in disbelief how effortlessly their words came out and so articulately. 

I was too afraid to speak for fear of humiliating myself as I have done in the past by forgetting halfway through what I was saying or just speaking gibberish nonsense. 

I‚Äôm always beating myself up after every interaction with my support team for not being able to keep the conversation going. They have to think of a plethora of topics to keep me communicating with them and so there‚Äôs no awkward silences. 

Whenever somebody responds to something I tweeted, it takes me several minutes or hours to compose a reply just because of the overthinking I do. Is it offensive? Is it just too weird? Does it make sense? I don‚Äôt know.

Guess I also find it difficult to talk because I‚Äôm so ashamed of how little I have accomplished. So I‚Äôm always scared that once people know I struggle with finding a job that lead to three suicide attempts last year, hence my embarrassment.

1424,CntSpellMeWithoutDie,1587069500,8,"I remember a few years back when I had my worst birthday ever. I came home to an empty house. My pet rabbit, basically the only living creature that was friendly to me, died a few weeks before that. I entered, saw the empty space on the floor where his cage used to be and burst into tears. I spent the birthday with my mom and I'd never felt that lonely. 

I remember next year when I had my most wonderful birthday ever. I had a loving (or so I then thought) girlfriend, I was headed to a very good college. I was actually happy for once in my life. I remember the wish I made while blowing the candles - that the next birthday I could spend with Her again. 

I remember the next year when I had my worst birthday ever. Destroyed, depressed, anxious and mentally exhausted. She left me that summer and it obliterated any sense of self worth I had, I'd argue that it actually collapsed my identity that I had had to rebuild ever since then. I remember having recalled the wish from last year and bursting into tears over the cake. I was alone again, only me and my mum in that room.

I don't really remember the next one. And I'll probably forget this one in a bunch. Nothing of substance has happened. I've hit my rock bottom and I'm steady as she goes from then on, dragging my belly through the filthy mud down below. I went all in on one person and lost, I have no close friends, no one to wish me happy birthday except for my mum and no one to care about anything about my life. My mum doesn't really like me anyway.

Don't listen to them. It doesn't get better. No divine intervention, no miracle to cast your darkness away and no unexpected friends when you're drinking your sorrows away alone in your room and cutting your wrists because the insufferable existential dread that creeps on you every day, every night, and every fucking year on your damn birthday is so excruciating that you'd rather rip out your veins than have to wake up ever again.

1430,darlene_alderson,1587065926,5,"Hi guys,

To get straight to the point, I've liked this guy from my college for a long time now. When I first started liking him, it was during my second year of college and he had a girlfriend. But after college ended, I told him how I felt and he said he felt the same way but needed time to figure out what he wants.

In September (the start of university) he told me that they broke up. So we started a long-distance thing since he moved somewhere else for uni. In December, we finally saw each other and had a great time. We made out and made plans to spend a whole day together the next day. But when I went home, I got a text from him that he still isn't over his ex. This was really upsetting since he kept reassured me the whole time that he's over her, but he wasn't.

We didn't speak for 2 months until he messaged me to just catch up. I thought I was over him but as we kept talking, those feelings came back. Not long after, he told me still has feelings for me and I said the same. We agreed to try and start things up again but it's been really delayed due to Covid-19.

I feel super lonely not being able to see him, especially since he is a very slow texter (he goes days ignoring my messages). It makes it even worse that him and his ex are at the same uni and it makes me a little paranoid sometimes, especially since he said that he 'thinks' he's over her now.

No matter how bad the situation is, I can't seem to let him go. I don't know what to do since I am now in love with him and he doesn't even know it.

I think the day (the 14th) before it took me a while to get to their messages but we chatted most of the day as far as I can remember.

We hadn't been talking that long but I really enjoyed his company. I don't think he was lying about his identity. We would share face pics and videos that I think were recorded in the moment, but I guess anything is possible.

Anyway, I looked forward to talking to him and I'm genuinely really sad I don't have him to talk to during these long work at home days.

I've been back in the States for almost a year now, having been a missionary in the Philippines for the two years prior, and I'll be honest in saying I've struggled socially when I got back. I've had issues with depression and anxiety for years and since coming home I haven't been able to bring myself to really make friends, despite desperately wanting to.
I did make a new friend at work back in August, we'll call her Sara, and for a while that was really great. However, with her being kind and intelligent and attractive I developed feelings for her that in the end she simply didn't reciprocate and I haven't seen or spoken to her since January.
Last night I had a dream that the two of us spent the day together. We sat in a tea shop, listening to music and making jokes at one another. I held her hand as she laughed and we talked about the meaning of all of this.

I suppose this dream is just my mind telling me I'm lonesome and finding me of what I'm missing in my life. With this quarantine going on there isn't much I can do to change my situation, but it seems I ought to be ready to make a change in life once it's all over.

He‚Äôs been a huge part of my life because he would help me get through the times when I was feeling awful. I also helped him too, we were both very depressed and lonely people.

He‚Äôs always wanted a girlfriend, and recently he finally got one. He hangs out with her almost everyday.

So that‚Äôs been hard on me.

Then I thought I might‚Äôve made a real connection with someone on Reddit tonight and I thought maybe we could end up good friends, but near the end of our interactions they just kinda left and stopped talking to me, with no real reason given.

My girlfriend was already prepared to leave me over it before and now that it‚Äôs happening all over again so soon, I get the feeling the days of our relationship are numbered.

The few friends I had before have just slowly drifted away since I don't even live in the same town as them anymore, and I'm struggling to come up with any reasons to live. I try to tell myself things get better but when that's all I've done for the past few years and nothing has gotten better it really doesn't mean anything. The only people I feel comfortable talking to about this are some online friends I met a few years ago, and they have genuinely helped me during my suicidal period and are all-around great people. I wish I could talk to them more but I'm scared of coming across as needy as they all have other friends and things to do, I don't really want to disturb them.

Obviously COVID-19 hasn't helped at all, my parents have forced me to come home which makes me feel even more isolated and powerless because we live in the middle of nowhere, and I'm struggling to keep up with my uni work as working from home is really difficult for me, so uni only serves to pile on more stress at the moment. I miss being able to go in to the studio at uni and just chat and work with people there, as superficial as it might've been it kept me at least a bit sane. I enjoyed my first few days at home with my family, but after a week or so I just cannot stand them, we aren't really compatible people (they're much more outgoing and boisterous than me) and I just need my space, but it's hard to get when they keep insisting I join in with their games and conversations. I don't want to open up to my family, I've never really felt that close to them, and after mentioning that I'm lonely to my mum she just says stuff like ""you need to get out there and talk to people sometimes"", which just makes it frustrating to talk to her.

I'll keep it simple, I want to die. 

I don't enjoy living, I don't have friends and my family hates me or is afraid of me. My own mother even told me she's afraid of me. In our household things are almost always my fault and almost everything I say or do is wrong or bad.

My father committed suicide as a birthday gift and I was so worthless to him I was mentioned once in his last message and not even by name. 

I genuinely don't see a reason to stay here. I'd like to die. Of course with death come costs. Because nothing is free in this world. 

So am I an asshole for wanting to die?

After telling my parents and them not believing me for years, I eventually told them I‚Äôd kill myself if they didn‚Äôt help me, about a year later I ended up going to the hospital and soon after started medication. I‚Äôve taken different antidepressants for the past two and a half years, but nothing ever helped, few weeks ago I decided to stop all psychiatric treatment and just continue therapy and try to rehabilitate myself w/o any meds. Anyway, the point is, through all of this, I have an unflinching feeling of loneliness which is often accompanied by strong feelings of detachment, like I‚Äôm not even there. I was a v shy kid, but after being frustrated heavily by social anxiety, I eventually forced myself to learn how to talk to new people.  What I‚Äôm trying to say is that since highschool started, I have had no problem making friends, and I even fell in love sophomore year, but nothing changed. I felt as alone as ever. It used to be more than I cld handle, the thought of being like this for the rest of my life was terrifying, but at this point I‚Äôve reluctantly accepted this is how it‚Äôll be forever. Let me clarify, I have a set of friends, and I would kill for them as they would for me, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs them, as they‚Äôre the only people I‚Äôve ever had a connection with, outside my family. I‚Äôd also like to clarify I feel empathy and other emotions, I‚Äôm not psychopathic. But back to the point, I feel so far from the people around me, and it never goes away. I don‚Äôt know what made me decide to post this, ig I‚Äôm asking if anyone feels or has felt similar, as when I‚Äôve brought this up to my many drs and therapists, they don‚Äôt seem to understand.

1513,ZfpAtz991,1586989062,85," 

I'm a 21 M and I'm a very shy person (when I'm around people I don't know), some people say being shy is cute, but it actually just sucks because someone who is shy is usually perceived as obnoxious and rude, and that's not always true.

I've always been a bit ""different"" since I was a kid, and I used to be very judged and rejected when I was younger for having different interests or different points of view from most people around me, so I guess that made me ""allienate"" myself and that's probably why I became a very quiet person.

I consider myself a really nice and kind person, and the people who know me well agree with me, but when I'm in social situations a lot of times people just think I'm really rude because I don't talk much and I just remain with a self-assured quiet posture in order to not become vulnerable.

Romantically, it's a disaster, even though lots of people keep telling me I'm handsome I simply can't approach girls, and I usually get a lot of attention from them, I just don't know what to do with it so I end up looking like a weirdo, and women like confident guys.

So basically being shy is just terrible, and especially if you're a guy, I'm not saying shy girls have an easy social life, but it's not the same because shy girls are considered ""cute"" even though they're shy, and according to social norms men are expected to be confident and out going so guys who are shy are just seen as creepy, rude or awkward.

I wouldn't say I can't be confident because when I'm around people I know well and trust, for example my close friends, I can be very playful and talk for hours, but when I'm around people I don't know very well I just remain quiet because I feel like I will be judged if I say anything and I suck at small talk.

It's actually unfair in my opinion that people perceive shy guys as obnoxious or someone with bad manners because that's not always true, but I can't blame other people for judging me that way because I'm the one who's wrong for not being able to communicate well with strangers.

In conclusion, the social life of a shy guy is absolutely horrible, I just needed to share this thoughts.",lonely,Being shy just sucks,2020-04-16 08:17:42

For two years I've been lying about my progress in university, drinking extensively and living of the money she was providing. Lies have finally caught up to me and the whole thing came crushing down. She gave me 2 days to move out of the house I was then living in. I was devastated, scared of what future holds and furious at myself for being so selfish, lazy and ignorant. After two days mother arrived and with tears in her eyes told me to go. I left with backpack full of clothes, phone and 5 euros. At that time I had two friends and one of them had talked his brother into letting me sleep in his garage. So there I was: lost, angry, broke. But the most prominent feeling was loneliness. No one gave a damn about where I was, how I was and will I be there in the morning. I remember that I didn't blame anyone, but I really wanted someone to talk to, someone to tell me what to do, how to get out of this mess. Eventually I found a job, a place to live, made peace with my mother, made some friends and met a brilliant girl. Last night I dreamed of this and it hit me hard. I woke up and it got me thinking: how many guys out there are suffering the same way I did? I believe that it is my obligation to share what I've learned in order to help at least one person.

1544,IMrGreyI,1586953433,3,"Good morning, everyone!
I think I really need support rn. I‚Äôm 17 and I feel really lonely over the past year. I haven‚Äôt ever gotten a gf in my life and actually, I wasn‚Äôt caring about it before. I was telling myself that I didn‚Äôt need a gf until I graduated from school (I think I will say the same thing at a university, work, and so on). Actually, I really need a person who  can support me, who I can talk to, with whom I can discuss different things. But I never got ANY attention from any girl EVER. I mean, I do everything I can for that: I have great stylish clothes (shirts), I‚Äôm slim and tall, I behave myself friendly and confident but it doesn‚Äôt work at all. I do have great friends but I can‚Äôt discuss my feelings with them because they all already have had relationships and also it‚Äôs just uncomfortable for me to talk about it with either my friends of parents. Also, I‚Äôm a furry so it‚Äôs really difficult to hide it because people treat us extremely negatively without any reason. (Please, don‚Äôt hate me because of it :(  )
Recently I was watching Alpha.m‚Äôs videos and it actually helped me for some time to feel happier but now I‚Äôm feeling really bad and lonely again. I can‚Äôt get why I never get a chance to get a gf. Why do I never get any attention? I‚Äôm a very friendly and open guy but I‚Äôm always kinda an outsider (Every company of friends is just a bunch of jerks smoking weed, eating only fast food and walking in shopping malls all day long). I frequently dream about my imaginary relationships and even what would I do if I was a father (How I would parent my kids, etc). No one normal would think about it at my age. That‚Äôs weird. (To clarify, I‚Äôm not an old-fashioned guy. I‚Äôm actually very much modern).

I always tell people to be happy, give advice over relationships and THEY DO WORK! I look like a happy guy but actually, I‚Äôm really sick of it. I make myself look confident but I‚Äôm not happy with the way I look or behave. I‚Äôm trying to change it and I changed my personality a lot past several weeks. I just want people‚Äôs attention because I try so hard. I can do a lot of things (be a team leader (I‚Äôm always one but everyone does almost nothing except me. Although I‚Äôm not a ‚ÄúNice guy‚Äù,  I‚Äôm pretty persistent), easily say or present anything in public, even be a DJ (I learned it after a party just in case), there is almost nothing I can‚Äôt do or learn). 
I understand that my mental age is WAY older than 17 as I am surprisingly more experienced (And that ‚Äúmore experienced‚Äù guy is writing a post on Reddit. Lol)  and sober in a plethora of ways (life situations, style, way of thinking, etc). It‚Äôs just sad to see than my peers do so many immature things that any sober adult would NEVER do.

Omg, this post is so teenagerly stupid. I‚Äôm sorry about that. I just need to talk to someone...",lonely,I need help,2020-04-15 22:23:53
1545,L3gtphantom,1586951242,16,"You say you care, just to prove you don‚Äôt

My name is Ryan (21M). I feel like I‚Äôm writing this because at this point, I‚Äôve got nothing to lose. None of it matters to anybody I know anyway, so I might as well just tell all of you.

I haven‚Äôt always felt how I feel now. Up until about maybe grade 7, I had a ton of friends. People that would show genuine excitement on their faces whenever they see me, phone always going off from texts, people talking to me everyday. But ever since I‚Äôve left middle school, things have been going downhill.

It seems like everybody I used to know just stopped caring. Whether that be because they got busy, got bored, or just didn‚Äôt care enough anymore. People always say when people want to leave your life, let them go. But after they all live one by one by one, that philosophy begins to fade. You start to look at yourself as the issue. Yourself as the problem. 

Why can‚Äôt I seem to keep people around? I‚Äôm now 21, I‚Äôm in college and I hate how I took those days for granted in the past. Where I had friends, family that showed they cared. I don‚Äôt feel like I belong anymore. Like nothing I ever do makes a difference in anybody else‚Äôs life anymore. I‚Äôve tried to be the best friend I can be because despite how shit people treat me, I still treat others how I‚Äôd want to be treated.

Maybe a week or has passed since I‚Äôve first tried to reach out to people who feel like me on here. At first it seems some of you all care, then by day two you guys are all gone. I hate being selfish, you all have your own lives and own stuff going on. I just wish there were people that genuinely wanted to stick around is all. I met someone on here who called me their favorite person ever after just talking for a few days. Honestly, I felt the happiest I can remember since they said that. 

But now, days later it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve just forgotten I exist? Paragraphs fade to one word responses. ‚ÄúHow are you feeling‚Äù every morning when I wake up, turns into no responses from them at all. A different person I thought genuinely cared about me seems to forget about me every day until about an hour before she goes to sleep that night.

I have one real friend that lives five hours ahead and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm smothering the hell out of her. She knows how great of a friend she is and how positively she‚Äôs impacted my life since she became a friend of mine, but I feel like I rely on her far too much. Like she does what she can, she says she likes being here for me but I can feel it crushing her.

I‚Äôm not looking for answers from anybody. Or solutions. Not looking for anything honestly. Stopped looking a while ago. I just wish I didn‚Äôt disappoint everybody in my life and was enough to keep people around is all. Every day I read about people who have succumbed to illnesses, tragedies and suicide. It‚Äôs like I feel like my life could‚Äôve been utilized better by so many other people who have lost theirs. I don‚Äôt know...just felt like getting this out.

I hope nobody ever has to feel how I do. It sucks feeling this way. I hope you all stay safe out there. Better me be dead than any of you.",lonely,"You say you care, just to prove you don‚Äôt",2020-04-15 21:47:22

1555,archerz2,1586942326,3,"Ever since young, I was always taught to put my studies first and focus on school over everything else. Whilst everyone was out playing together and socializing, my parents thought all of it was a waste of time, so I spent most of my years inside watching YouTube and such. I've never had friends over to my house, been to a friends house, gone to a birthday party or anything of the like. I didn't even have a phone until 2 years ago, once I begged my parents constantly. This didn't do much though, as everyone else had a phone 4 years ago and had already made their group chats etc without me. I had people I would talk to daily about common interests, but no real friends that cared about me other than what I had to say, and didn't have any interests in meeting outside of school. Furthermore, my school wasn't exactly full of angels, and most of the people were antisocial and not open to the idea of making new friends. 

I don't think my situation is too uncommon but to summarize: I have no real friends, everyone views me as a temporary option. Everyone says to make new friends in the future in a new place, but I have missed out on so much socializing that I won't even be able to do that. So here I am now with good grades, staring at a screen all day to forget my lack of social life. I hate being alone like this, but I feel like it is also too late to practise socialising at an age where everybody is good at it and has their own friendship groups.",lonely,"Lonely, and too late to rectify my situation",2020-04-15 19:18:46

This is a throwaway, and I'm going to do my best to not divulge any information about who I work for, or where I live. 

COVID-19 shut down half the country, and sent the other half into dissary. While many business have had to temporarily (and permanently) close their doors, a few select industries and business's have quickly implemented and rolled out new ventures to try and keep things going, and to ease the stress on other companies within that industry. 

I've been thrown into the middle of this situation, and surprisingly I've flourished. My boss is loving how well our branch is coping with this extremely annoying and manual process, our customers are super happy, and I'm doing well. I'm focused, I'm calm, I'm somewhat collected. 
I used to work in hospitality, so I'm no stranger to stress, long hours, and pressure. I've worked through earthquakes, and I've given up nights to help cook for victims and survivors of massive incidents, some naturally occurring and some not. 
It's in those situations where I feel I thrive. When the pressure builds up and I can just switch off and get shit done. This is no different, I'm getting shit done and I love it.

But this time it's different - I've never had much of a life outside of work. Hospitality never afforded me the time to take a weekend off to go away with friends, or attend that wedding, or celebrate my birthday. Growing up I was always told that if I worked hard I'd be successful. Well fuck, I've worked hard, but I've lost what should have mattered most, and gained nothing for it. 
I turn 25 next month and I'll have nothing to show for it. I'll bake myself a cake and probably sit alone on my bed wishing I could rewind to my highschool years.

But for the first time in a long time, I feel wanted. My phone is constantly buzzing, I'm constantly answering emails, and I'm constantly working. I do my 13 hours at the office, and then I go home and remote in to keep on top of any other issues that my pop up. There's always something to do, or some fuck up to fix.
My employer loves that I'm working hard, and my paycheck reflects that. But I can't help but feel that once this lockdown ends and normal business resumes, that my life will go back to the boring, monotonous drag that it once was. I'm dreading that.",lonely,"I'm an essential worker, struggling to get up everyday",2020-04-15 18:39:20

the thing is that i‚Äôm pretty alone in life. i have a great family but i don‚Äôt live with them so it‚Äôs not as easy to talk with them. i don‚Äôt have any friends. i‚Äôm not sure what i keep doing wrong to not be able to keep any friendships or relationships. i‚Äôm always open and caring, and eager to do things yet no one seems to want to include me in their life. granted i‚Äôve dealt with this my entire life so i‚Äôll admit i‚Äôm used to it but some days it kills me to the core. i‚Äôm constantly thinking of every trait of myself and how i can be a different me in hopes someone will want to stay. but lately i‚Äôve given up on that, kind of in a hopes to just be myself and know that people will come along who will love me for me, and want me around but in return in kind of made me antisocial and stuck in my head. 

i‚Äôve deleted all my social media and i‚Äôve stopped replying to texts from anyone who i slightly know. at the beginning of all of this quarantine shit i was motivated and creative, feeling good about reinventing myself during this but i‚Äôve lost steam and i‚Äôm so fuckin unmotivated and sad. staying busy was my only way to cope with my depression and now i‚Äôve lost all motivation to wake up, i just want to sleep forever and just not even more from one position. i need help. i need connection. i need some type of light. i want to talk with someone so fucking badly but no one seems to want to care.

1583,hamartiated,1586919608,2,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-15 13:00:08
1584,curioserandcurioser3,1586918885,4,"Being apart and lonely is like rain.
It climbs toward evening from the ocean plains
From flare places rolling and remote, it climbs to heaven which is its old abode. And only when leaving heaven drops upon the city

It rains down on us in those twittering hours when the streets turn their faces to the dawn,

And when two bodies who have found nothing, disappointed and depressed, roll over; and when two people despise each other have to sleep together in one bed

That is when loneliness receives the rivers

That poem is a joke yet still disappointing with its purpose, the loneliness of thinking you matter to nothing and thinking your loneliness matters to nothing it‚Äôs not because of other people, people in general just don‚Äôt like you that much, that‚Äôs the reality of it all nobody likes anything the only reason we‚Äôre alive is because we‚Äôre so far removed from a survival enviornment that we just have to sell our selves to support ourselves, with no reward, same with people you can be like ohhhhhhhhh or you can shove it up your ass pretty much, it shouldn‚Äôt be that way no one wants it to be that way but good luck putting all your faith in someone to be your entertainment and your slave and your mirror to distort your self image, perhaps the most honorable path I could take is you know what, still the call of misery is all I have the tolerance for, ask yourself are you lonely or are you scared

Every time I meet someone new I'm terrified they'd figure out who I am and leave, so I try to be who they want me to be so they'd stay longer, or I try to be myself so they'd leave sooner, but eventually they always do and it feels so horrible it's difficult to feel anything else.  
Why does it seem so easy for other people? To have people to lean on and to go back to, to have someone who would see you as irreplaceable, that if it's not you it's no good. Are you just born into it, because you felt it growing up it's easier to find and attract it yourself?   
Or is loneliness something that I'd always feel? I've felt it for so long I don't know who I am without the empitness and fear and sadness and self loathing. Even when I am with friends, even when I share how I feel, even when they reassure me they'd be here for me no matter what, it won't stop.

1624,SmokeWineEveryday,1586878010,4,"So I've been doing this for as long as I can remember and I was wondering if someone can relate. Whenever I'm home alone, or at some other place and I'm absolutely certain that no one can hear me, I just start talking to myself but in a way like someone is there with me and is able to hear me. It can be about all sorts of things. For example, back when I was at high school and I was walking to my bus stop, my ""conversation"" could have gone something like ""Ugh I really hated that test. And what was up with question 4? I had no idea how to answer it, like what did that question even mean? Well at least I'll be home in 45 minutes. Can't wait to play \[whatever video game I was into at that moment\]. Oh guess I better hurry or I'll miss my bus. We don't want that do we. Nope we don't.""

So that's just a quick example. And sometimes I just start quoting a bunch of random stuff from series or video games or start singing weird made up songs about whatever comes to my mind and I guess I'm basically trying to entertain both myself and my ""audience"". I also do this when I'm in bed. But then my conversations with myself often go a bit deeper and then it's kinda like I'm talking to an invisible therapist or something. Or I just talk about some things that I can remember from my past.

I don't consider myself to be a crazy person or anything, as I probably could stop doing it if I really wanted to and it's not like I hear voices replying to me or anything. I'm pretty sure that's just my way of avoiding feeling lonely. I'm fully aware that no one can hear me, but in a way I guess I still kinda hope someone does, if that makes sense? I definitely did have a pretty lonely childhood and unfortunately I can't say that things have really improved now that I'm 25 years old, so I guess that's why I'm still doing it to this day.",lonely,Does anyone else just constantly talk to themselves but act like there's an audience that can hear them?,2020-04-15 01:26:50

1642,Mei8Mei99,1586856083,7,"Throughout my entire life I've always been bullied and it wasn't until high school that I found a ""decent"" group of friends. (side note: my parents are pretty neglectful generally).

I really really thought they were decent people. I mean they didn't go to my school but they treated me like I was a person, which is rare. They were all very nerdy and not very attractive people, but they were a family and I loved them. I happened to meet these people because I was volunteering at a dog rescue center. I was pretty close with this group for a long time, but when college began things started to change...

The ""leader"" of the group really liked me and supposedly we were best friends. We did so many things together and for once in my life I felt wanted. However, as soon as the first semester of college started she kinda became cruel. She would spread nasty rumors about anyone who disagreed with her or anyone who liked a person she liked.

For instance, I dated a guy who was in this group. For whatever reason he really p\*ssed her off and she kept feeding me all these lies about him. She would say things like ""he's cheating on you"", ""he doesn't care about you"", and ""he really doesn't want to have sex with you."" Maybe, I was dumb to believe her, but who was I to question her? She's my best friend. She'd never lie to me. Eventually, she got everyone to hate him (including me) and he was forced to leave the group.

Her tendency to lie just kept getting progressively worse and worse. No one in the group really called her out on it. I suppose it was because we knew each other for so long and we were ""a family."" Idk. I regret not saying anything sooner, but I was really scared of getting kicked out of the group. Mostly, because I had no one else to turn to.

Things really hit the fan when I told her I liked a guy she liked... I told her cause I trusted her. I really didn't think she would turn to harassing me. She would leave me texts/calls telling me how much she hated me and how I was such a wh\*re. Eventually, I had to block her from everything, it was just too much.

A couple of days go by and I start to pursue the guy. TMI: we would make out and cuddle like everywhere on campus. Little did I know they were f\*cking dating... I mean he was so affectionate to me like out-in-the-f\*cking-open. I obviously broke it off, decided to unblock her, and told her what had happened. I was really hoping she would understand what a sh\*tty human he was but that was wishful thinking. Instead she pretended that she was sorry for hurting me and that she'd break it off with him.

She also faked having an asthma attack and I skipped class to make sure she was ok. She then proceeded to scream at me for being a wh\*re and trying to steal her man. I couldn't handle her sh\*t anymore so I left the group. I tried really hard to keep in contact with everyone else in the group, but it was too late. They already chosen a side. I was the ""enemy"" of the group. To this day I have no idea why, even with text message proof of her sh\*tty behavior.

So I tried to find new friends. I was really lonely and felt so out of place in college. I don't remember how but I met a really attractive dude who, in retrospect, was a massive loser. (I thought he was so cool and I had no idea why he'd ever want to date someone like me). He seemed really kind and we had some major chemistry. We ended up taking each other's virginity, though it was strange to me why he never had a gf. After a couple of months he would get so aggressive with me and threaten to hurt me. He told me constantly how replaceable I was. Like literally he'd show me pics of other chicks and threaten to leave me for them if I acted up.

Again, I just got fed up and left him, but that just angered him more. One night he was driving me home (not sure why I agreed to the ride) and proceeded to drug me. I woke up without any clothes on and the car windows all fogged up. I hated my life so much at that moment.

I never saw him again. I avoid him and his friends like the plague. I reported him to my college and nothing came from it, not even a restraining order. So I left. I left that college. I left all of my hopes and dreams.

1664,DrummerSammay,1586845064,1,"Fair warning this is going to be long so if you don‚Äôt want to read all of it there‚Äôs a TL;DR at the end :)

 I was homeschooled K-12. My only friends were my cousins, and kids from church, and the church kids never asked to hang out with me outside of there. My only socializing time was on Sundays for a measly hour, and whenever there was a family get together. Because of this I have always been extremely awkward socially. I can have conversations just fine, but even to this day I still sometimes struggle to come up with topics interesting enough to keep a conversation with strangers going.

Not being around people my age drastically impacted my social skills.  What mostly made me awkward was my cringe attempts at humor. I‚Äôve always had pride in having a great sense of humor, but in my younger days (especially around 8-12) it was a really weird sense of humor. I know we all have our own quirks that some people may find weird, but considering I was homeschooled I didn‚Äôt know what other people found funny. Looking back at it I think most of the kids from my church just tolerated me. They didn‚Äôt necessarily dislike me, but sometimes my jokes went a little too far (e.g. I thought it was funny to say my friend dressed like a douchebag for some reason).

What especially didn‚Äôt help my mental health as I grew up was having my best friend (from the church) bring a narcissist with sociopathic behaviors. I think he only talked to me because he didn‚Äôt like anyone from his school, and having a dark sense of humor myself, he enjoyed being able to make dark jokes with me. But of course, he was a narcissist. He would barely ever want to hang out. We only chatted through gmail. He never showed actual care for me. In fact looking back on it I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever actually said anything positive about me. That is definitely not a good friend to have, but in my mind, even though he hurt my feelings a lot, he was the only person who would give me attention besides my parents and brother. 

On my 13th bday, I got a computer and started playing Minecraft. After a little bit I met a cool group of people from a server, and started talking to one guy who lived in Germany. I saved up enough money to buy a microphone and we started talking on discord everyday. At first I was super nervous but once I got to know him I got much more comfortable with him. He was also an awkward kid and we bonded pretty quickly as we had a lot in common. Him being from Germany and not talking to people in English very often helped me be myself without feeling awkward for the first time in my life. We‚Äôve been super close friends for nearly 6 years now and I‚Äôm always going to be thankful for him. But of course, he lived in Germany. We thought we would never be able to hang out, at least not until we‚Äôre 18. It sucked because we had so much fun playing games and talking, but that‚Äôs never the same as being with someone in person. So at this point in my life I was getting more comfortable with social interactions, and had a best friend who was actually a good person, but I still felt so lonely. 

Once I turned 15, I got a job working as a food server at an old folks home. I would talk with my coworkers and the old people every shift, but there were only about 2 people I ever had real deep conversations with, and they were both over 60 years old. I was finally starting to get the hang of what‚Äôs socially acceptable, and a lot of the old people loved me. Even though I was awkward at times, I always treated them with kindness and respect, which goes a long way. 

Then once I was 17 I started working at target. This place is where I FINALLY bloomed socially. Almost everyone working there besides the managers were my age, and they are such cool people. I‚Äôve been working there for nearly 2 years now. I have so many friends there. I am finally able to just talk to any of the new people, and connect with them. Obviously it doesn‚Äôt work out with everyone (there were some really bitchy people I just didn‚Äôt want to associate with) but I am always greeted by just about everyone when I come in for work. Even my managers love me, and I‚Äôve been told I will be considered if there‚Äôs ever a manager position open. I almost cried when I went back to work for the first time in a month the other day (I was on a leave of absence cause I didn‚Äôt want to catch corona) because literally EVERY ONE OF MY COWORKERS SAID THEY MISSED ME. It just feels so great to finally be loved and appreciated by so many people. 

TL;DR: I had no real friend until I was 13, and even then they lived thousands of miles away from me. But now at my job I‚Äôve been at for 2 years I‚Äôve found so many new friends! I finally have people that appreciate me for who I am.

Anyway I‚Äôll wrap it up, and I‚Äôm sorry this was so long but I want you all to realize that no matter how bad you might think your personality is, or how boring you are, there WILL be someone who will appreciate your presence. You just got to have patience and be willing to work through your problems.

So he'll be gone a long time, at least 4 years I think. And we never spoke outside of work anyway. So why do I still think about him? I hardly knew him at all.

If I ever think of being with someone, I think of each and every possible thing I can mess up. Maybe her family doesn't like me for my lack of drive and therefore she can't see me, or she won't like what I'm into, or my lack of interest in sex. That's why every chance I get alone, I'm always imagining myself with my perfect girl. I remember one time that I talked myself to tears because I was thinking of how she'd never exist. I'm tired of being lonely, but more than that. I'm tired of not being happy. Every family event, I've got the same unhappy, bored, depressed expression. Speaking softly and monotone. I honestly wish sometimes I could fall into a coma so I could just stay in my dreams where things are actually working out for me. My family and I are moving soon, but it's to the country. Maybe the change will help me, but the physical isolation on top of the mental isolation will feel so much worse. Anytime I try to talk to people about it, I often get the same response about how I should pray for help and guidance. I'm not violent towards people, but everytime I hear that, I feel my fists clenching automatically, and something clicks in my brain that I'm basically talking to a wall. I calmly (or as calm as I can be) tell them that I don't believe that bs and they respond with ""Maybe that's the reason."" I don't wanna turn this into a rant against religion, but I'm just gonna say don't bother praying for me, it's never worked before even when I was a believer.

1677,ShadeofBlu,1586839394,22,"There comes a point, in most of our lives, where we fall asleep hugging a pillow, longing for that one person who you might not even know yet. A person who gets you, loves you and accepts you the way you are. You feel the sinking in your chest and somewhere in your mind you know that a meaningful hug will fix it. This is often followed by a feeling of incredible loneliness and a sense of disconnect from the world. Yearning for someone who understands you and seeking a deep emotional connection is something that many of us want. We yearn for that warmth and acceptance that person might bring to us and how you can do the same for them. 
The unsettling reality is that the person we yearn for during our loneliness most probably exists somewhere in the world, and it is entirely possible that you may or may not meet them. This thought has crossed most of your minds and the uncertainty has haunted us ever since you hugged that pillow.


Loneliness is a powerful feeling and it is quite natural to experience it. It is also incredibly subjective for when a person feels it and how often. Some might feel it at a young age, some during their 30s or 40s and some in their old age. It is also powerful in a way that makes you humbler and more appreciative of that person when you do eventually find them, but also devastating when you don‚Äôt. 


The very core of our human nature is built upon having a shared experience, and while this might not apply to everyone, it applies to most. It can be quite disheartening when you achieve something, or have a particularly good moment, and don‚Äôt have that one person to share it with, who you know would truly care about hearing it. This is where your own consciousness might devalue your experiences and achievements. Which can be quite dangerous for you as an individual. This leads to grief, discomfort, and depression. It is a slow and painful process. 


What is fascinating to me is that most of the time you find that person purely out of luck and coincidence. And you are glad you found them just as they are glad, they found you. It also takes some time for you to realize that you have found the person you are looking after you initiate a relationship, Sometimes too long. But you‚Äôll know for sure at some point, as you realize that words aren‚Äôt necessary for you two to understand or stay with each other. It is quite beautiful.


We yearn for this connection every day when we realize we don‚Äôt have it. For some it might be subtly and for some it might be prominent but what is constant is our true desire to seek that warmth, acceptance and love.


Even though it may not feel like it, remember you are not alone in this. Hang in there. I hope you all, myself included, find that person.",lonely,We all yearn for that one deep connection.,2020-04-14 14:43:14

The Backstory goes like this. 8th grade was very stressful for me, I was barely passing, I was going to be in High School in months, and I had little to no friends. Until a girl, we'll call Sharon, joined my 7th period class, she was absolutely breathtaking, I recall first seeing her and introducing ourselves, we were both nervous but got along well within a few days, she didn't have many friends until about Sophomore year, I've been told by her friends back then she really liked me and I should ask her out. I knew she had a crush on me after talking to her for a few days. I liked her back it's just my social anxiety prevented me to. So it never blossomed into a relationship and we remained friends since. We just recently found each other on Facebook.

Yesterday, I shared a meme from r/gaming (at least I believe it was) it went something like this. *Me: God, give me a sign. God: SUFFER (it was a light bar that said suffer, like one you'd see on a metro bus or in a subway tunnel)* either way, Sharon sees it, post a laughing emoji, then messages me minutes later.

The convo went a bit like this.

Sharon ""Are you doing ok?""
Me ""Yeah, I'm fine""
S: ""I don't think so""
Me ""What do you mean""
S: ""It's okay if you don't want to talk about it.  You posted that suffer thing and at first I thought it was funny but I was wondering if something was going on""
Me ""No, I'm okay it was something I found funny on Reddit""
S: ""Oh, okay""
Me"" I appreciate you checking up on me though.""
S: üòÅ
Me: I really do. But my phone is overheating so I got to get off.
S: You're good. Night.
Me ""Good night ""

Why does this matter to me or you?

But now that all communications is email, I have this strange feeling of being lost. I have no interaction with other people. Is this really what it's like to be lonely? Waking up with a strange emptiness and desire to talk to people, yet having none to do so? I've always been rather introverted, but I feel like now I've crossed a threshold I didnt know there was.

It was too late. She was living a lie and didnt feel the need to tell me. She told another guy. The other guy is ""just a friend"". She tells him everything. She tells me nothing. She confides in him. She doesnt think he has alterior motives. Im a man, I know better. It doesnt matter though. 

Its so confusing. We have been trying/not trying to fix this since I found out about it (her true feelings) in october. 

We went to counciling. She hated it. The councilors told her the inconvienent truth. That she was doing things unkind to me and bad for our realtionship by secretly talking to this other guy and even hung out with him alone a few times. Her friends on the other hand tell her what she wants to hear. 

She went with what her (new less than a year in length) ""friends"" said. She is moving out ""to find herself' and filing for likely a divorce or perhaps a legal seperation. 

Im moderately lucky in that she doesnt want ""maintinance"" (aka alimony).... But she wants her half of the house.  Ita going to suck.

Where this leads to the loney page is that my long term friends do not share the same world-view as me. In fact im not sure I know anyone with the same world-view as me. 

So after she leaves I dont know who to talk to. Ive reached out to a few and they seemed supportive at first but one ditched me twice on biking plans. One talked to me for a day and then radio silence. Another seemed annoyed with me after a minor difference of opinion was expressed. 

So im a 31 yr old male in quarentine at an ""essential"" job with a wife that is likely leaving me for another much older guy (she ia 25... Other guy ia 37?.. Yeah wtf?!).  I dont know how to connect with people anymore. Online dating sucks and i dont want dates. 

I used to be in college, or school... But if you arent in college and arent in school, how do you meet people? And how the heck do you meet people with the same views? Im part of a small church but have not seen many females in my age catigory. I mean... Grocery stores arent likely places... Im not a bar guy and frankly I dont want to talk to a woman that does not dress modestly. 

I feel alone again and feel like there is no point. I wake up, work, come home and ponder the point of playing a video game pointlessly or watching a movie pointlessly. 

Im going to get financially raped in this divorce and im just so fricken angry and resentful at my soon to be ex for messing this entire situation up with her idiocy and impatience and disloyalty.  

Do I lock myself down to this home I love? Or do I cut it let alllllllll the work i put into it go? If i stick myself here i'll be tied down but since we were married I was settling down into a career and this house and...UGH wtf..

Throughout the 23 years I've been alive I've always valued myself as lesser than everyone else I always put others a head of me and gave people attention when they needed it I always helped out people when I could and never wanted anything in return. I've made many mistakes in my life too many to count but I always did things on my own ofcourse I had friends but I've learnt to keep my circle small due to many of them slowly drifting away and I understand that. Some of them have stabbed me in the back and at one point I was bullied for being dumb they would call me names make fun of me and try to break my spirit. Those were tough times in my life so far eventually I got tired of it I set my goals and started to work towards them. I've always wanted to help people even if that meant risking my life I'm willing to put myself in danger for others even if that meant death. I don't enjoy making things about me. 1 more thing I need to get off my chest I've always been afraid of getting too close too others because everytime I do I hurt them in someway not physically stand alone my soul is jealous it wants love but I reject it because I'm afraid what would happen to me how I would change would I go back a step or forward I've been asked out 9 times total but ive said no everytime mainly because I don't want to hurt them although I do still care for them even if none of us speak anymore and every year my mom pushes me to go out and find someone but I just don't think I'm ready for someone else yet I'm still changing and growing and rn all. and ive been in love with a girl i cant have, i just dont know why god put me in this path and i dont know why , why god i dont care if i get rejected from her. a friend is all i need rn. and also I want to do is help people and I know I can't help everyone I can't cure depression or save someone dying from cancer or Corona all I can do is be there tho and give them attention and try to help them to my best capabilities I just want to protect everyone I can and I know I can't do that I'm just a boy in a world much bigger than I can imagine but maybe when I risk my life for someone they can protect someone else they care for or cherish the ones they love that is my true goal in life to help people in there time in need.

I just discovered this sub and after crying for 30mins straight after realizing how much I relate to all of you I started thinking about my loneliness and the first time I really noticed it. 
I told someone when I was about 7 years old, that I made up stories and worlds in my mind and played them out in my head before falling asleep, kind of like a goodnight story for myself. The other person just looked at me weird and laughed at me. She told others and they all made fun of me.


The thing is, I still do this. I still make up a story for myself while trying to fall asleep. Mostly the stories will be inspired by movies/series/books etc. 
I like to imagine myself being the well liked lead role or my own character who's liked by everyone in that imaginary scene. It makes me feel powerful and not so lonely anymore. 
Due to corona my school is closed so I have a lot of time and lately I've noticed that I will take about 3-4 naps a day and set 5 alarms for after my ""big"" sleep so I can fall asleep multiple times. That way I can make up more stories instead of facing the hard truth that I'm lonely as fuck.
So I guess my question is wether anyone else imagines scenes in their head as well and if anyone has tips for kind of getting control over it again?


tl;dr:
I make up stories before I go to sleep where I'm well liked and it's gotten to a point where I'll sleep multiple times a day just to imagine a scene in my head.

All throughout high school I never felt like this, even though if I look more closely I had reason to be concerned. Even though I was sometimes bullied for my background (Indian) and for being shy I would eventually overcome this and move forward.

During high school, I met new people and always seemed to have people to talk to in class or during lunch. I never felt alone during school hours. However, after class was over I would head back home and not communicate with my friends from school. No meetups, movies, parties or even sleepovers . . . Nothing. I wasn't allowed to play video games and wasn't given a phone till year 11 because of my strict parents however I didn't organise anything verbally with school friends.

Here's the crazy thing: I was ignorant of it and didn't think twice. I had YouTube, music (hip-hop), tv shows and Reddit to make me feel like I was having interactions; the comment section took the place of banter between real friends. This went on for all 6 years of high school.

The penny dropped once I applied for college, got accepted into my first preference (like a good Indian boy) and started to transition to this next phase. I had played off my lack of socialising as me being a nerd and focusing on studies (makes sense). However, I always had looked up to college kids and thought ""This is where I hit my stride"" ""This is my moment to be part of a friend group and go to parties"". At my first orientation, my heart sank and everything got worse beyond what I could imagine.

Do you know when your in a large group of people and you look around to see everyone in their groups: laughing, yelling, bantering. You immediately become self aware and a wave of anxiety and depressive thoughts envelopes you. You string together about 100 of these moments and this sums up the worst years of my life: college. The worst part is that I know that I have a lot to offer and I try to make everyone around me feel good and welcomed when I do interact with others. Even if they laugh and banter with me;again once they leave campus or the train carriage we were on its . . .  silence. 

I make acquaintances and not friends. People tend to use me for whatever they information or resources they need or will only talk to me if I bumo into them. Then I'm  tossed to the side or as they go back to their ""best""/""original"" friend group. 

So here I am. Sorry for the wall of text. If you've taken time out of your day to read this I appreciate it. Have a great day and stay safe during this quarantine.",lonely,I need help and I don't know where to go. My youth is slipping away (22yr),2020-04-14 01:49:10

1735,OlimpiaegerOfficial,1586789804,1,"Couldn't think of a good title.
I wish I had true friends. My parents and relatives do care about me, and try helping me even through these difficult times during the pandemic.

I used to have friends. Not the best, but at least someone who I could understand. Don't want to insult them but most of them had several mental problems, which I completely understand.

Time went on and High School came. Even during the first days I was bullied and got name called several times. However, I ignored them and they left me alone. I made a few friends but only one of them actually writes to me, asks how I'm doing, but even that doesn't happen recently.

Making online friends for me is easy, but that eventually ends up the same as the latter from before, the care slowly decays and they don't write back, even if they do it's either lines like ""good"" or some other short message.

Since the COVID-19 is thriving across the world, everyone is forced to stay home. I don't usually go into town a lot, even if I do, it's for sports.

In my class I tried acting louder and slowly realized that I was verbally bullying cooler kids, they wouldn't tell the teacher because that would spoil their image, so next year I'm gonna stop and act silent. I just wanted to gain attention, but even that failed.
I'm not usually the one in charge, but I INCREDIBLY hate being bossed around by kids the same age. For that one I didn't even try, because that would fail miserably too.

I get some recognition from teachers, but my image in the class is very forgettable.
Every day, going up to Discord, writing to the same person who only replies with things like ""good"", ""yeah"" etc. I honestly have no person to talk about this.
Now, immediately you would reply that ""you need to speak to your parents"".

It won't help.

I tried talking to them and hinting that I'm very lonely, but they said they can't assist me. And I understand them. They are often busy and even when they are available for a chat, we often talk about something else, because like I said before, they can't do anything. You need to make friends yourself, your parents won't find you one.
Of course, this is purely my opinion.

I was very desperate about a relationship, since when I go to parties there are more boys than girls, and those parties are even held by people who don't have too much friends themselves. They just invite guests to add a theme to the ""party"".
I am still thinking about it. But many people have mixed views, from calling girlfriends useless to claiming that every teen must have a girlfriend.

I don't know why am I so unpopular. I am not the prettiest person in the world or the most talented one either. I don't want to be popular or anything, just have a few friends. I never had a girlfriend, in both meanings. Never had a lover, or a person who I truly loved, or a girl who I would claim as a friend.

I used to have suicidal thoughts back then, where I would cry myself to sleep and was thinking about killing myself. However, that ended when I graduated and left Primary school (here we call it Primary school, there are no things like Middle Schools). And then came High School.

I'm not English, but I have more friends abroad than in my own nation.
Summer is coming soon and I know that it will end up the same as every other summer. Me sitting down and playing games, excercising and sleeping, possibly having a vacation. That may sound good, but it's getting boring. I am boring.

I'm not the best student, as I have bumpy grades/marks. But I don't even have motivation to move on to College because no friend is ever encouraging me. My parents want me to go there so that I could continue studying and have a good job, but I told them it will possibly change, and get a job after High School because I am already having enough of it.

Anyway, on with the show.

It's currently 2 months away from my 25th birthday and as of late (or I guess especially as of late) I haven't felt whole. I've craved some sort of romance or some sort of excitement in my life to break the sad routine that hasn't been fulfilled. I'm growing more bitter and jaded as time goes on.

Let's start with my love life and lack thereof. I find it funny when people on here say they haven't had sex for  a few months or even a few years. I've never been close to it ever! I think maybe a girl tackled me and kissed me once as a joke and then played the harrassment card on me when I started to like it (figures). I've never been approached by a woman ever, not even for a friendship.  If anything like that did happen, I've had to pursue it which tells me that I'm not physically or emotionally attractive in any way. I had what I thought was a long distance relationship once but it was very high maintenance due to her being emotionally unavailable most of the time and she eventually walked out on me without even so much as a goodbye, so I guess I'm a loser for that too.

Now let's look at one of my friends; He's good-looking, lost his virginity at 14, banged a hot co-worker who came onto him at his first real job (18) and now is dating someone very affluent, intelligent, and beautiful (21-23). And I have other friends with more social as well as romantic experience than me. 

Going back to this friend who I know very well, dare I say hes my best friend. In spite of this, I feel resentment towards him behind his back for having what I couldn't dream of, and with all this claims hes depressed. Please! If I had half of what he had of a life, I'd shut my mouth forever.

I've never held down a job for more than a few months and that was just recently. I've been turned down by god knows how many employers and got fired from a volunteer job placement once because they didn't like me, soul crushing, I tell you.

At my recent job, I thought I'd make friends but it wasn't happening. I dont know if I'm the problem or I live in a socially frigid town. I was mostly annoyed by my peers there.

I've never had one crowning achievement or a great moment in my life that I can be proud of, plenty to be ashamed of though. My upbringing didn't help things, my parents despised each other and got divorced pretty quickly.

Perhaps this is selfish of me, but I hate how I dont have one talent that only I can do and I guarantee you that anything I can do, someone else can do better.

Sometimes I have hope for the future. Other times like right now i wonder what death's warm embrace would be like and how it would probably give me the closure that I probably need.

&amp;#x200B;

I figure I'll make this short and truthful. I've tried to make a post, my first post, many times now, but I feel like I ramble into nothingness after the first paragraph.

&amp;#x200B;

For all 19 years of my life, and still now as a sophomore in college, I've been lonely and alone. I was always the fat loner kid in school. Only managed to shed most of that weight by not eating anymore, and slowly wasting away. Never had a real friend or gods forbid a relationship, no matter how much I ache for one. Never really talked truthfully about this at all, I guess. I know I've always been the hopeless romantic, the kind of person that just wants another to share my time in the world with fully, but I think I've lost the will to try anymore. I don't know if it's the spiritual side of me, but I've gotten so much colder in the last few years. Nothing describes it more than a bleeding heart of stone. Maybe if I let that heart harden, it wont bleed so much anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost count of how many nights I've fallen asleep crying quietly or unable to bear being awake anymore, desperately holding a pillow like the love that's never going to be there. I feel like I've been broken open, and each day another small piece of me dies under the moonlight. I wonder how much longer I'll keep this up, really. Too proud to get the help I desperately want and need, or maybe it's too terrified.

In my gut I knew he was wrong, but at the same time I thought maybe I was being over dramatic. Luckily for me, I finally listened to my gut and broke up with the emotionally abusive scumbag. Months after our breakup, I would have a couple of flings that were fun but empty. Dating again was draining, I scared off a guy that I liked because I told him he was only in it for the sex. I regret that deeply. But it was my fear that I was being used and abused again that made me do it. I don't know if I could ever be in a functional romantic relationship.

1799,RUSSIAG_5,1586734765,2,"I struggle to talk to people I haven't spoken to in years. A recent time I tried to talk to someone I didn't speak to in years I was at a school activity and there was two people from another school there aswell. This activity thing lasted a full week and I wasn't sure if I should have said hi because she was talking to someone else so I thought it would have been a bad idea to talk to her. I tried talking to her being like ""Oh my god I haven't seen you in ages I didn't recognise you at first"" and then she said ""I recognized you since day 1"" (I tried talking to her on the 5th day of the thing)
I always had anxiety about talking to people from my old primary school because I was diagnosed with aspergus syndrome when I was 4 (Not severe and I have not symptoms now of autism or aspergus) and when I was in my last year of school I thought that people in my class only where speaking to me and where friends with me because I had this syndrome and they were told by their parents and teachers to be nice to me. I have no evidence to back this up other than every time in art class I once purposely put no effect into my art work once and people walked pass me and said my work was amazing. Another reason why I thought this is because when i first started primary school at age 4 I used to throw tantrums alot for the next two years to the point where my parents told me the parents of other children in my class wanted me to be out of that school and into a specialist school. Although the parents of my friends later accepted me (although they could have done that because of my syndrome)
Another friend who was in the year below me stopped talking to me when she left primary. I don't know why I haven't spoken to her since and my parents and her parents are still really good friends. 
Another person I knew because my parents and their parents are still good friends I have a complicated friendship. My parents told me when he came over with his brother me and my brother would be babysitting him. At first we argued alot for the first few weeks but eventually we talked properly mainly about school and how shit it was. They only needed someone to walk them to their after school activity thing and somewhere to stay for like an hour or two after they finished their after school activities I don't know why my parents considered it babysitting and I cringe at the arguments and thoughts of it being¬† babysitting. I haven't really spoken to him lately because like the last two he has other friends and probably have moved on.¬† 
Over the summer I helped my brother and friend out a summer camp with the leaders of the camp being people from my primary (Not in my year they were either younger or older point is they knew me from school). We played one game of bulldogs and when I was about to catch one of the leaders they turned the head so fast to avoid another person, didn't see me and ran straight into my hand however I was startled a bit by how fast he turned my hand sort of clenched into a fist slightly and I feel really shitty. I tried to say sorry but he acted like I didn't exist and it was like no one saw. Also they try to give me extra help with things even though I don't need it such as planning a quiz, I can easily come up with questions that relate to what the quiz was but they insisted on helping me. They also never included me in conversations or anything which i'd say is fine because I get it there are people in the world who don't want to be friends with other people. 
Or it could be because of my brother who has the same syndrome as me but there are times when he tries to have ""banter"" with other people or ""live in the moment"" (I'm not sure what to say it's like it's him trying to be enthusiastic) but for example if I'm with him he either tries to pick on me like brotherly banter type thing or he's trying to be funny but I look at people's faces around me and they have no idea what's going on. I feel like they think I'm like my brother in that way which I'm not. I'm mostly quiet and shy and I keep to myself but when people get to know me,They know that I'm very chatty and expressive. Since I went into secondary school I met new friends and I've never told anyone that i have aspergus syndrome (except for one friend). I guess what I'm trying to say is I wish the people from my primary were honest with me from day one. My friends in secondary school would be like ""what are you fucking retarded"" if I did something dumb because that's what friends do in my opinion, They make jokes that are in their friend groups. Even though I do have friends now it's very limited to just my school. I kinda wish I could get to know people from other schools but it's near to fucking impossible. Any advice and opinions on the other people?

I haven't been in a relationship since I graduated high school which is coming up on 5 years now... Nearly 5 years without any love or affection. Nothing at all now I'm nearly 21 and it's all starting to creep up on me.. I live in a share house with 3 of my closest mates from highschool, and it's been awesome.. but seeing them happy the way I want to be is destroying me, I'm super happy to see them happy but at the same time it only makes me think about how lonely and deprived I feel.. I'm one of those guys that hates talking about feeling or even the idea of crying but it's all getting a bit much, I find myself staying up till sunrise every night sitting in a dark room with music playing that only makes me think more about how alone and worthless I feel.. I average maybe 3 hours sleep a day and eat once every couple days.. I try to hang out with my friends still but I just feel like a 3rd wheel. Watching them cuddle and kiss and just be happy with each other isn't too fun to be around when your literally sitting there constantly feeling alone.. and the thing is that feeling doesn't ever go away, it just sits there. When I wake up and before I go to sleep it's always there, I try to utilise my art to help me keep my mind off it but I recently ran out of paper and ink for my black pens and due to the whole pandemic I ain't working and being a NZ citizen in Australia Im unable t claim anything and on top of that my mum's really sick, in and out of the hospital.. So I'm in a bit of a dark place right now... I just feel so lonely.. as I said I love with my closest mates but even then i still feel so alone.. I want nothing more than to cuddle up with someone and hold them close and just  forget the world for a moment... Someone who wants to be there at my lowest when I can't help but cry... I just want to be happy and feel loved... To be able to love someone .. I'm sick of sitting up all night alone crying in the dark by myself because i just don't know what to do.. I'm trying to cope but I'm failing and no one around me seems to notice..

1832,AgentTsu,1586700172,12,"/Vent\ I put up this fence whenever I meet people because of my experience in high school. I actually had a big group of friends in high school. Specifically my tenth grade year. I was playing football and interacting with a lot of people, and everything was going great. Then I started hearing about a lot of people who I thought were close friends talking about me to each other. It's one thing to think someone is gay, but it's another thing to talk about them in a negative manner to other people. At that time I wasn't sure of myself, but it definitely hurt hearing the things I heard. I did not even know who to trust at that point.

By my 11th and 12th grade year I had crawled into a shell. People still talked of course, it is high school. I had very few genuine friends, but it was never on a level of friendship they had with others. By the time I graduated, I was super alone, and when I started college I had a rough Freshman year. I could not connect with anyone because I was afraid to build any kind of relationship with anyone in fear that they were only going to be temporary. I'm trying much harder now, in my sophomore year of college to put down my guard and allow people into my life. I've joined a club, but even then I sometimes feel alone within a group of people. I feel I don't belong or can't connect with anyone because of my own insecurities. It's truly a bad habit that I want to be free of and that I'm working towards breaking. That is why sometimes I blame myself for being lonely because I could totally just suck it up and put myself out there, but I'm just afraid of feeling vulnerable again :( Sorry for the vent",lonely,Sometimes I think it's my fault that I'm lonely.,2020-04-13 00:02:52

So first i‚Äôd like to apologize for my english if it isn‚Äôt perfect, and i‚Äôd like to apologize too if i‚Äôm too emotionnal but i just don‚Äôt know where i can express this feeling in my chest.
Well yesterday was my 22th birthday and i wasn‚Äôt feeling it even before the day.
Since my 10‚Äôs, my birthday always‚Äôs been synonym of a kind of loneliness feeling.
I don‚Äôt really have any ¬´¬†family social environnement¬†¬ª (?) but it‚Äôs okay, i understand and i don‚Äôt take any of my family‚Äôs member responsible for this feeling even tho i know they should, but i know they tried and try to do their best, but you know, life lmao, so it‚Äôs okay.
But when it comes to whom i may consider to be my closest friend, i find my self lost.
I don‚Äôt know how i should describe my friendships, but i‚Äôve always seen anything around me as a kind of superficial, empty, been wondering why are ppl acting this way, and why they feel the need to express some things, but i‚Äôve been aware of my own issues and insecurities so always tried to understand them, learn from them and stuff, put in my head that people and so, my friends, have their own paths to live and that they can‚Äôt always be wondering about me, how i may feel, like, i understand.
I‚Äôve always let my friends have their own space, let themselves grow, but always been there when needed and tried to show them that they‚Äôre part of this world and that they‚Äôre loved ;
and they‚Äôve always thanked me a loooot for that, and told me that i‚Äôm ¬´¬†special¬†¬ª for them, that they love me, that i‚Äôm so kind, bring me to their safe place etc even tho i‚Äôve never asked anyone to put me in a higher place in their heart, i‚Äôve always been a giver without any expectation and been okay with that, i just love to help people and watch them grow.
But being told to have any special place in someone‚Äôs life brings me to those ¬´¬†what should i feel for them, what should i do¬†¬ª kind of thoughts and i‚Äôve always tried to believe them, tried to reach peace in my psychic who‚Äôs at constant fighting when it comes to social stuffs, always tried to ¬´¬†rationalize¬†¬ª when it comes to my fears.
And yesterday, actually none of those people reached to me and told me anything for my birthday, and i‚Äôm so in pain but i don‚Äôt want to, because it‚Äôs just a birthday, like i‚Äôm not dying or stuff, i don‚Äôt even like birthdays, but i feel like i‚Äôve been ¬´¬†lied¬†¬ª to, that i‚Äôve tried to find within my self a ¬´¬†matching love¬†¬ª for those ppl, and this is what brings me this feeling.
I truly want it to be nothing, like ¬´ it‚Äôs okay, they might‚Äôve forget , it doesn‚Äôt mean they lied to you, or they‚Äôre just maybe no ""happy bday wishers""¬†¬ª but why do i always have to be the one whom it‚Äôs okay to forget, why are people around me always SOOOO SORRY when they realize the wrong they do me but they never realize it before, why do i always truly believe and forgive them?
Like, i understand ppl don‚Äôt always got the time or the energy, but i also know they would‚Äôve done it different to other friends who ¬´¬†are not that special¬†¬ª so why always me? Am i an ¬´¬†envy person¬†¬ª for that? 
All i‚Äôve ever wanted is to be a part of the reality everyone live in, even if it hurts, like i know i‚Äôm TOO kind however it doesn‚Äôt mean i‚Äôm fragile, i‚Äôve never asked to feel special within anybody‚Äôs life, so why do i always feel like ¬´¬†i‚Äôm asking too much¬†¬ª , am i actually asking too much..?",lonely,I feel like i‚Äôve always been living a social illusion,2020-04-12 22:54:04

I have a small family. A little broken and my father died from alcohol five years ago, but there are still some people who love me, no matter what.

My boyfriend for eight years loves me more than I probably deserve. I love him too. He‚Äôs my safe harbour although we‚Äôre in a long distance relationship due to his career. Although I sometimes feel we don‚Äôt connect on an intellectual level, but you can‚Äôt have it all, can you?

Based on the society‚Äôs norm I am beautiful, and for that I‚Äôm very thankful of course. I have a job, a degree and food on the table. Still, I feel so incredibly lonely.

1840,empty_shell21,1586694058,2,"So I went a few dates with a girl I met online a couple years ago. The last date ended very awkwardly. I remember going to dinner and that went alright. Conversation wasn't great but not terrible either and then we went on a walk through this mall the restaurant was located in. Then she took my hand and held it as we walked, and I just clammed up and basically froze. Just didn't know what to do or how to handle it. Because something like that handed happened to me before and I guess I didn't see it coming. So we continued walking in silence for the most part and I walked her to her car, gave her a hug, and she left. I texted her that I had good time and she texted back that she felt the same. Then I just didn't text her again and she never texted me again either. I felt like I'd blown it and that I should just move on.

Fast-forward a couple years and I texted her a few months ago, because for some reason I wanted to, see what she was up to and try to find some closure or maybe see if it was possible to start over. So we ended up meeting up and had some coffee. We just caught up with what each of us had been up to recently and then I left without really asking her what she thought about how things ended. I ended up texting her to find out and she acknowledged that she felt the awkwardness too during that last date and said she wasn't really interested in dating at the moment. I asked if we could just hangout again, just to have fun and not go on a ""date"". She agreed and we did hangout again and it went pretty well.

I've text her a few times since then and it always seems like we little nice back and forth but she doesn't seem to ask me any, or very few, questions. And I'm almost always the one who reaches out to her, not the other way around. I've gathered from my interactions from her that she's pretty reserved and probably an introvert too, which makes us pretty similar. So I'm not sure what to do, that I should keep reaching out to her and try to hang out some more or wait for her to initiate because I don't want to hang out with someone who isn't as interested in building a relationship with me as I am with them.

I think I should move on if she doesn't reach out to me again but I'm pretty lonely so letting go of a chance to have a relationship with someone, especially when they've shown some interest in me in the past, is really, really hard.

I fell in love with this incredible awesome, and beautiful girl, honestly I would of never of thought that such a girl would go out with me. 
After dating for almost 5 months everything was all right, until the pandemic hit and since our only way of communication was though cellphone(she hated using her phone for interaction) I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to kiss her or be as close as I was before, so I baked brownies from scratch for the first time in my life, that way I could at least show her that I loved her even though I couldn‚Äôt touch her or see her.
I even gave her a birthday present since I would not be able to be with her that day, I told her to open it up until her birthday(18th of April) and yesterday she called me and told me that she thought I was the one who gave everything on the relationship, and that she wasn‚Äôt giving what she should, and that she was afraid that in the future she wouldn‚Äôt give what she should, so she told me she needed time between us a break, so that way it wouldn‚Äôt hurt me as much.
 I told her I didn‚Äôt  want to prolong the inevitable and asked her what she really wanted, she said she wanted to break up with me. after that I had a panic attack, and hung up, since my aunt died yesterday, my mom is really sick and I‚Äôm in a crippling college debt I‚Äôve been trying to pay by working as a freelance lawyer. 
After two hours of trying to get my mid together I Told her I loved her and she told me she would love me as a friend, but I couldn‚Äôt, I love her so much, after a while I realized I was being a jerk by not being her friend, I love her and why not love her as a friend, I care a lot about her; I‚Äôm from Mexico and there is a difference between love , te quiero and te amo,  and te amo is this pure love and affection that you feel from the bottom of your soul, and I love her as in, te amo.

Just don‚Äôt really know how to handle not being able to be with someone whom I thought was my soulmate, maybe I have to understand that she needs this, and that if I were her, I‚Äôd probably do something similar.

I've watched this movie for about 7 times now, but that was a year ago. The more I watch, the more I see my personality, characteristic connect to Travis Bickle's. He's a God's lonely cabbie, who suffers from depression living most of his life alone. Some of his personal aspect are quite related to my social life.

1/ I push myself away from people that I think care about me because of my insecurity. I always think that the presence of myself among them would ruin their days. I'm blessed that I have a good co-worker who actually talks to me, but for some whatever the fuck reason I keep a cold vibe toward them. ( Travis Bickle is cold and distant to his cab buddies despite that they actually like him and try to merge him into conversations)

2/ I'm socially awkward. And I swear, as a waiter, social awkwardness is a quite big liability for the job-performance, and of course my empty social life. (please don't tell me to quit for another job, my circumstance is complicated even though I fuckin' hate my job for that reason).

3/ Rejection from romantic interest becomes a regular thing to me since high school (probably almost a dozen of girls now). I'm average looking but they think I'm either needy, too introverted, underconfident, etc. Some of the girls that I had a crush on and really cared about, turned me down in despise, and after that, I just wanted to do some mad, crazy thing to flush my frustration and sadness to the toilet, before I moved on ( not assassinate a presidential candidate haha). Man, I'm already feel lonely right now. Can't believe it's 2:45 am now. The more the list goes on, the more I hate myself.

4/ Watching porn regularly ... hmm ... Glad I've reduced the amount of time spent on porn haha. And for sure I'm very aware that I would never take a girl to a porno theatre if I'm lucky enough to find someone lol.

There are some more minor things that I can see myself in the character. I'm God's lonely man :( .

Even though i‚Äôm a relatively social person (as far as having friends, talking to people, etc) i severely lack in one area of my life: physical affection. (and mental but we won‚Äôt get into that now.) Growing up in my family, we really never hugged each other, cuddled, or had any physical contact - except for my infant and toddler years of course. But since i‚Äôve been single my whole life, i literally do not Know what it feels like to be held - cuddled, have someone play with your hair, or stroke your arm, grab your waist, give you a kiss on the cheek - nothing. My family doesn‚Äôt even say i love you. We know we love each other, we just never say it. But sometimes i can physically feel the sheer extent of my lonlieness and touch starvation to a point where i end up hyperventilating and crying in bed because my body feels wrong - isolated and alone and like i need a hug that would last a thousand years to feel better. Also small side note, i‚Äôm extraordinarily insecure about my body even though i know many people who look like me, and i deal with body dysmorphia and all kinds of appearance-related insecurities. So when someone tries to touch me, even if it‚Äôs just a sibling messing around or a hug from a friend of a friend who i don‚Äôt even care about - i hate it, but simultaneously feel like i need it extremely badly. But my mind makes me feel bad about thinking i need physical affection, so i turn sour, and often deny this simple physical contact, and feel terrible about it because i know i need it. Not that i get much of that often anyways. But i feel like i‚Äôm predisposed to rejecting physical contact and in the rare cases where i‚Äôm presented with it, my mind makes me feel weak and like i‚Äôm emotional (in a way with  negative connotation) and basically like i should not be allowed to feel good things or emotional things, and i don‚Äôt deserve to.

1853,MintyDoughboy,1586676808,5,"You know what the worst part of being lonely is for me? Having to adapt to my loneliness. 

I wake up everyday and something is always different. I lose friends just a little each day. I have no person to like/love and have them be there for me. I wish I had someone to devote my time and attention to and genuinely say I loved or liked. I wake up and realize less people like me each and every day. Having no friend or person to like you or enjoy your company and having to get used to it and adapt to it being like that is the loneliest feeling in the world to me.

I don‚Äôt know I just get sad and lonely from time to time. I think about things and it all falls apart. I hate feeling lonely.

1857,ThereShallBeNothing,1586670889,5,"I have isolated myself from the social world for almost a decade, and I have never had any friends since my early childhood for the nineteen years I've drawn breath into this shell of an existence. I've made myself invisible to common eyes for most of my life. I just don't see the point, I feel so insignificant, so small, so useless... I am and have always been a ""shut in"" outside my responsibilities. I am normal, I am not scary or unique looking, I don't suffer from any mental disabilities or something like that. I just want to be seen, to be heard, and to be understood. Yet whenever I scream into the valley darkness for help, I only hear the emptiness my own miserable &amp; shallow voice echo to me in return. A part of me enjoys the suffering and loneliness, it gives me a twisted form of purpose, but I know what kinds of reapings those sowings could bear. 

Being alienated and forcing myself to be anti-social for seven years, has left it's scars echoing through my conscience, making me feel guilty or insecure of the slightest mishavings. All I see is darkness, all my good memories bring regret, It hurts to know I exist, I am so full of hate, for myself, and the world. I don't know what to do. I wish I had someone to talk to. I'm tired of being lost in this void, suffering in plain sight, and nobody sees. 

I remember during my early teens, how I was ""that guy"" the majority collective chose to ignore, or just never noticed. I was always stuck in my thoughts, in my own dimension, giving myself advice and motivation to fill in a black hole of lack of group care. I tried for so long, even until now, to be my own friend. I went to the extent of adopting social constructs like the Abrahamic God, to be my opium and hence heal the feeling of painful alienation from society and lack of understanding from others. However, I was never integrated into a social group, of any kind. As far as I can remember I have been alone since birth, with no one to relate to. I haven't ""experienced"" what most have. People to me, are like pixilated characters, or contrasted personalities in stories. I can see them, and read them, but they do not see me, or read me. It is like a one-sided glass, and behind that glass is an enchanted painting called ""life"", of which I am the solitary observer, in the empty museum.

There is no point to anything I do anymore. Everything becomes duller everyday. Living is suffering, my motive for surviving has become to understand that suffering. I wish I was not invisible in plain sight, because it makes me feel like I shouldn't exist. It is the worst feeling, walking in crowds, because that is where I see everything that tortures me. Friends enjoying themselves together, a gleeful family, a romantic couple, and the priceless happiness and laughter of children, all reminding me of things I once had, and never had at all. All of this, while I feel death's nihilistic finger on my shoulder, mocking my lonely dim existence. 

I am stuck in my own alienated version of hell, where my evaporated and unseen halo of tears could fill an ocean. I am in a shadowy prison cell, missing a fragment of my soul, awaiting the end of my world. I wish it were different, that I could be reborn, or time-travel. But this universe, seems it is just so unforgiving to the ego...

I don't know what keeps me going. It is that curiosity that keeps me alive. It is the fact I don't see the point in almost anything, that keeps me from dying,  it keeps me from ""living"" too.",lonely,I live better in my dreams than in this hellscape.,2020-04-12 15:54:49

1865,hamartiated,1586663564,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Whenever I'm with a ""friend"", they always seem more invested in the other friends they are with.

I am like their last choice. They always look at their other friends when they are talking. Their facial expression changes when they look at me. They smile at them, but they don't really when they look at me. I thought it is because I don't smile as I normally just don't, but even when I try to smile, I don't see their facial expression change. Only when I try to ask them a question do they look at me.

Even when they have their own problems, I try to be as understanding as possible and help them. When their other friend who did something mean to them but they like spending more time with them, they just talk to that other friend about their problems. I feel like because they don't trust me as a friend and think of me as more of a ""acquaintance"", I just feel distant and never tell how I truly feel. I just feel so alone.

1883,RUSSIAG_5,1586644615,2,"I struggle to talk to people I haven't spoken to in years. A recent time I tried to talk to someone I didn't speak to in years I was at a school activity and there was two people from another school there aswell. This activity thing lasted a full week and I wasn't sure if I should have said hi because she was talking to someone else so I thought it would have been a bad idea to talk to her. I tried talking to her being like ""Oh my god I haven't seen you in ages I didn't recognise you at first"" and then she said ""I recognized you since day 1"" (I tried talking to her on the 5th day of the thing)
I always had anxiety about talking to people from my old primary school because I was diagnosed with aspergus syndrome when I was 4 (Not severe and I have not symptoms now of autism or aspergus) and when I was in my last year of school I thought that people in my class only where speaking to me and where friends with me because I had this syndrome and they were told by their parents and teachers to be nice to me. I have no evidence to back this up other than every time in art class I once purposely put no effect into my art work once and people walked pass me and said my work was amazing. Another reason why I thought this is because when i first started primary school at age 4 I used to throw tantrums alot for the next two years to the point where my parents told me the parents of other children in my class wanted me to be out of that school and into a specialist school. Although the parents of my friends later accepted me (although they could have done that because of my syndrome)
Another friend who was in the year below me stopped talking to me when she left primary. I don't know why I haven't spoken to her since and my parents and her parents are still really good friends. 
Another person I knew because my parents and their parents are still good friends I have a complicated friendship. My parents told me when he came over with his brother me and my brother would be babysitting him. At first we argued alot for the first few weeks but eventually we talked properly mainly about school and how shit it was. They only needed someone to walk them to their after school activity thing and somewhere to stay for like an hour or two after they finished their after school activities I don't know why my parents considered it babysitting and I cringe at the arguments and thoughts of it being¬† babysitting. I haven't really spoken to him lately because like the last two he has other friends and probably have moved on.¬† 
Over the summer I helped my brother and friend out a summer camp with the leaders of the camp being people from my primary (Not in my year they were either younger or older point is they knew me from school). We played one game of bulldogs and when I was about to catch one of the leaders they turned the head so fast to avoid another person, didn't see me and ran straight into my hand however I was startled a bit by how fast he turned my hand sort of clenched into a fist slightly and I feel really shitty. I tried to say sorry but he acted like I didn't exist and it was like no one saw. Also they try to give me extra help with things even though I don't need it such as planning a quiz, I can easily come up with questions that relate to what the quiz was but they insisted on helping me. They also never included me in conversations or anything which i'd say is fine because I get it there are people in the world who don't want to be friends with other people. 
Or it could be because of my brother who has the same syndrome as me but there are times when he tries to have ""banter"" with other people or ""live in the moment"" (I'm not sure what to say it's like it's him trying to be enthusiastic) but for example if I'm with him he either tries to pick on me like brotherly banter type thing or he's trying to be funny but I look at people's faces around me and they have no idea what's going on. I feel like they think I'm like my brother in that way which I'm not. I'm mostly quiet and shy and I keep to myself but when people get to know me,They know that I'm very chatty and expressive. Since I went into secondary school I met new friends and I've never told anyone that i have aspergus syndrome (except for one friend). I guess what I'm trying to say is I wish the people from my primary were honest with me from day one. My friends in secondary school would be like ""what are you fucking retarded"" if I did something dumb because that's what friends do in my opinion, They make jokes that are in their friend groups. Even though I do have friends now it's very limited to just my school. I kinda wish I could get to know people from other schools but it's near to fucking impossible.

Hello all, I am a 22 male and I have never really been in a relationship.

throughout middle school, high school, and college I have never developed any meaningful relationship with others. The friends that I made throughout have disappeared. females seem to have no interest in me. I compensated for this by working on myself because everyone says it is not their fault, it is probably you. So I spent most of my academic years learning about myself; I'm pretty sure I am highly introspective. even though I am self-aware, I am always thinking why I'm lonely and it leads me to the worst of thoughts. I love myself (I'm really smart, kind, athletic, slightly average), but when others don't want to be involved with you, one will naturally think there is something wrong with you. My self-hatred is growing because I don't know what others see in me that they don't like.

I know most people here will comment something along the lines of 'work on yourself to attract who you want' or 'be happy being with yourself' or 'go to therapy'. The problem is I have been alone with my thoughts for so long, I am sick of hearing it. I have talked to myself, comforted myself for a long time. Improving myself doesn't seem to be working. I can make friends but I won't be the person they'll invite to their wedding.

My biggest concern is if something doesn't change that I won't be able to trust future relationships. Right now I am on track to financially secure my future. being rejected for so long, I will be suspicious if somebody is slightly interested in me.

TL;DR Having been rejected and formed 0 meaningful relationships, my lonely thoughts are causing me to breakdown and although I am mentally strong (years of battle) I am beginning to lose.",lonely,I am slowly starting to feel depressed due to being lonely,2020-04-12 04:56:45

I was doing quite well for a while.  I've relapsed a few times with self-harm but aside from that, I've felt good about life. I don't like hanging out with people all the time and I kinda like quarantine because I have a good excuse to avoid others (self-isolation isn't mandatory where I am). 

I have a boyfriend. I have a good friend group and we're always chatting together. I'm not on my own but I feel like I am. I want to see friends now and then but I'm not allowed to leave the house because I have a lot of schoolwork to catch up on, so I have to rely on social media for interactions. People don't really make an effort to reach out to me specifically, aside from my boyfriend. They address the group chats and I'm included in the conversations but it's not a 1-on-1 deal.

I feel like such a burden and it's affecting me. I'm anxious all the time, at a low level, but I get spikes now and then. I really want to talk to people.  I messaged someone and told him to talk to me or I'd bite him, as a joke. His immediate response was ""im cleaning fuck off"". I'm lonely because I actually want to be social but trying to initiate it constantly is driving my self-worth into the ground. One of my close friends only really talks to me when she's doing badly. I don't mind helping her, I love her, but I wish we could talk normally. I wish I didn't have to post on my private stories, maybe twice a day, ""Someone go on a walk with me"" or ""Someone talk to me"". I don't get replies. 

I want to message people first. I want to take charge and start conversations. But I feel like people are beginning to talk about me behind my back because of how obviously desperate I am. I feel like I've crossed the boundary between ""endearingly social"" to ""overbearing and exhausting"" and I don't know what to do.

My boyfriend is hosting a get-together for his friends tomorrow and I'm supposed to go but I want to stay home instead because I'm scared I'll just annoy everyone present. I'm scared I'm annoying him as well and I've thought about breaking up with him purely to save him the trouble of dealing with me. I have a lot of problems to work through and he lets me talk about them to him but I know he gets upset hearing about them and that's another reason why. I feel like if I were single then I wouldn't have any attachments with anyone and I could just delete Snapchat. It's my main way to communicate. If I don't have it on my phone, I can't message people and annoy them.

In Conclusion: I'm lonely because I feel like I annoy everyone

1917,awkwardly-british,1586623359,1,"I'm almost 19 (f) and started uni last September.

I've never been in a relationship, never even had a first kiss.

The closest I've ever been was this year at uni when I got very close to a guy who ut turned out was sinply leading me on, only to suddenly return to his girlfriend (there's more to it than that, but that's not what this is about).

My best friend at uni, who has become one of my closest friends in general has been in a relationship for 3 years. That is obviously not a problem; I don't expect everyone around me to be alone just because I am üòÇ. The problem is that she never shuts up about her boyfriend. She literally mentions his name in every other sentence.

To be honest, I'm sure a lot of people are like that, but what gets to me even more is that, even though she knows what happened with me and that guy I mentioned, and knows how much it affected me, she will still constantly say things like ""I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have [boyfriend's name]"". I've even heard her say ""um, I'm not a slut, I'm in a committed relationship of three years"". There are many more examples, but frankly, I can't be bothered to write them, and I doubt you can be bothered to read them.

Basically, my point is that this friend (who is a great friend in all other regards) and the things she says are a constant reminder of how alone I am (when it comes to romance). 

I try not to mope around too much. I'm quite an independent person, and I'm happy most of the time, but it is difficult to deal with the fact that I've never shared a mutual attraction with anyone yet.

I am aware that I'm still young, and I most likely won't be alone forever, but it's hard to remember that when there are people around me who are constantly rubbing their own relationships in my face, despite knowing how I feel.

This is turning to a ramble now, but essentially, I know that spending my formative years single has probably been very good for me, because I know who I am, and I know that I don't need to rely on someone. But this doesn't mean it doesn't get to me sometimes.

I feel bad because I worry that I'm a bad friend for getting irritated by the way my friend constantly acts. I don't know, I just don't want to seem like some bitter psycho friend.",lonely,Close friend makes me feel even more alone than I already did,2020-04-12 02:42:39

1934,vcw86,1586603680,1,"So much family drama in the couple of weeks, I‚Äôm pretty drained. 

Some context: 

It started when my cousin started posting pictures and Facebook stories of him and his friends partying it up in close vicinity of each other. Apparently they‚Äôre very relaxed towards COVID-19 over in Hong Kong. So I politely commented on his post, basically saying how I know he‚Äôs smarter than this. Please practice more social distancing. Just because you‚Äôre not in the U.S. or Italy, does not mean you‚Äôre entirely safe. 

He ignores me. 

Next week or so, he post yet another pic of him and a huge group of his friends, in what looks like a party room, arms around each other, faces next to each other etc. This time instead of commenting on his post, I use his pic and post on my timeline. I warn everyone to please practice social distancing and help plank the curve. Even if you‚Äôre in a place that‚Äôs lower risk, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre 100% safe. 

So a few days later, I was randomly scrolling through my profile wall looking for something else, I think I was trying to recall when an event happened. But I noticed as a scrolled past the pic that I used to remind my friends to be safe, I also noticed my cousin in the pic commented. 

He wrote: ‚ÄúHey fuck off bitch.‚Äù

I‚Äôm the bitch? For caring about whether he gets infected, or worse gets my other relatives in Hong Kong infected? All it takes is for him to come in contact with someone who‚Äôs asymptomatic. So I then notice that he‚Äôs also blocked and deleted me from Facebook. So of course I send his wife a message, and I fired back. Repeating myself at this point about the social distancing and just because things are more relaxed there, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre necessarily safe. And that he‚Äôs the asshole for choosing to react like this, instead of scaling back his partying. You know, to help keep everyone safe? Him and his friends clearly think they are immune and completely safe from the virus. I also say at this point, I‚Äôm embarrassed to be related to him. He‚Äôs older, so you would think he‚Äôd also be wiser?

His wife then responds about a week later (who might I add needs a refresher in English grammar), she writes: ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just stay the fuck out of our lives and go fuck your Canadians. I don‚Äôt even know who the fuck you are and you know nothing but just barking. The pictures we taken doesn‚Äôt mean the date posted. So just stop bothering us and being ignoring. We are embarrassed to have a ugly relative like you too. So just fuck off!!!‚Äù 

These pics were his bday pics, which means they were still taken during the period when COVID-19 really got going. So it still wouldn‚Äôt have made sense for him to be partying like he was. I thought my cousin was nuts, his wife is batshit crazy. I also can‚Äôt take her seriously because all I can see are all the grammar mistakes and wrong choice of words lol. 

But now I‚Äôm wondering why my mom has said absolutely nothing, considering she was the one who told me to post the initial comment to begin with! All of this happened on Facebook, she absolutely knows about everything that‚Äôs been happening. Your sister‚Äôs son just called your daughter a bitch, and you‚Äôre being completely nonchalant about it? How about some backup here? Not even a ‚Äòhey don‚Äôt call my daughter that‚Äô to my cousin. Nothing. When I asked her about this, she tells me to just suck it up and let it go? All of a sudden I‚Äôm being too sensitive and a problem? What?! 

So anyway, I‚Äôve been crying the past two days on and off. I feel completely isolated and depressed, getting absolutely no support from my own family. I‚Äôm just saying, if I was in my mom‚Äôs shoes, I would‚Äôve said something a long time ago. Like immediately. I would never let anyone speak to my daughter like that, family or not.",lonely,"I‚Äôve cried more in the past 2 days, than I have in my entire life",2020-04-11 21:14:40
1935,inkhonclusive,1586601895,1,"I have a few rules with dating

No dating friends, and trust is earned

I don't introduce girls I date to my friends because I hate making things awkward

I remember seeing this girl at a party with this amazing looking guy and I was so envious of him.  He was the weight class I wanted to be, and he had a huge place ..

A few months later I'd be nailing his girl ( Alice ) in her mother's place to the background of incense and wiccan books.  I was in Love with her ..  Her best friend ( Bethany ) was in Love with me ..  Until she hated me because I was an insecure broken person at the end of my rope and I challenged our friendship ..

When I broke up with Alice, I moved on to Carol instantly with a short stop with Zoey along the way.

Carol, I met in a game of spin the bottle.  Her best friend ( Debra ) liked me but Carol ended up winning the bottle spin so we kissed and she liked it and so we got together.  I was heart broken from Alice ..

And I've been heart broken most of my life ..  Right now I try to find good games of D&amp;D chasing this idea of deeply emotional games and during quarantine I've gotten into VRChat.

I broke up with Carol recently, and I moved on to Eve.  Who has known me since even before Alice and I ended up sleeping with her because ..  After all the idea of "" No dating friends "" I figured ..  Is she even my friend ?

Before Eve was also a few other girls who said they were my friends ..

.. But I don't think I could have that kind of close intimate emotional relationship because ..  I hate burdening other people with how much it hurts.

Because even if I tell them, what the hell are they going to even do ?

And "" friends "" try to give advice.  Stupid shit like ..  "" You really need a girlfriend .. "" or "" Have you tried X ? ""

I have done everything everyone has suggested aside from drinking.

Just to shut people up.

I hate burdening other people with how much it hurts.

.. And I don't blame anyone else for not looking for my pain.

But I wish I had a friend who knew me well enough ..

A friend who Loved me enough to give a damn

Most of them know that I left my family years ago.  It was a bad situation.  I was trying to build myself into something while being with people who kept pushing me down.

Every year, I spend Christmas alone because I don't want to hear "" What about your parents ? ""

And everyone keeps telling me "" You should reunite with your family again "" but no one knows what my life was like back then.  No one knows how cheated in life I was.

I hate ..  Trying to figure out ways to Love myself.

Trying to find good-hearted friends who aren't such losers, or finding successful friends that aren't such assholes.

And finding myself alone enough without support.

There are only so many pieces of art you can draw, or spa outings, or peaceful museum trips you can take before you take the only fucking option you know works.  The only consistent kind of Love and support you have access to.

Nothing else makes me feel right anymore.

I can't burden anyone either because ..  My pain isn't valid.

I'm not living paycheck to paycheck like people who are really in pain

Or without friends or dating options ..  That's valid pain

In fact, I have the gall to call good-hearted people losers.

I really don‚Äôt know what to say, or even how to convey what I‚Äôm feeling. 
I just feel very very alone right now. Over the years I‚Äôve lost most of my friends or they turned into acquaintances that don‚Äôt really keep up with me anymore. I do thankfully still have a friend or two left but I feel there starting to drift away as well. 
I used to be married not that long ago. Unfortunately things didn‚Äôt work out that well after she decided she liked her coworker more than me and promptly divorced me. There is a bit more to it but that is what it ultimately boiled down to. As devastating as it is, it‚Äôs probably for the best she‚Äôs no longer in my life. 
I think the weird feeling I‚Äôve been having is the realization that I‚Äôm going to be 30 next year. I‚Äôm terrified of turning 30 having no friends left and being single. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never have a family of my own. I don‚Äôt want to grow old by myself but I feel like this is how my story ends. 
Being alone during this pandemic has really opened my eyes to how lonely my life has been for a while. I feel like my life has no meaning, I feel like I‚Äôm living in a purgatory. 
I just feel empty and worthless.

1939,remaininganon1995,1586597367,1,"I just needed to get this off my chest....
So I met him when I was 18 on a dating site. He lied and said he was 28 when he was really 34. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal to me at the time because I wanted to date an older man. I also lived in a small town so the pickings were slim (he was the next city over). I moved in with him within the month. In the beginning, I was toxic. I was so insecure, and it manifested as jealousy, possessiveness and controlling behaviour. I would break down if I felt like he even looked at another women, I just couldn‚Äôt cope with him turning his attention anywhere else but me. About 4 months into the relationship I decided to go to therapy. After a lot of sessions, and a lot of work, I changed from an anxiously attached person to a secure attached person. 

Naturally, I started asking for us to start practicing healthy relationship habits. Things like not being able to go through each other‚Äôs phones whenever we felt like it. Of course, he refused, and gave me the old ‚Äúbut you were the one who made these rules‚Äù. 

He has a bad temper, like, chasing a vehicle down the highway and driving beside them screaming and honking kinda bad. He treats customer service people very bad, and will make scene‚Äôs getting irate with them over things like ‚Äúnot bagging his groceries properly.‚Äù He also loves to call the manager‚Äôs to complain about employees. Whenever he has any negative feelings, and I set him off or ‚Äúfight him on it‚Äù, he takes it out on me. He will say things to hurt me, and will berate me. He takes things I‚Äôve been vulnerable with him about, and will use them to try and hurt me. I know what he‚Äôs trying to do, and I understand he‚Äôs doing it out of anger, so I rarely get upset or raise my voice. I also know that when he‚Äôs angry, there‚Äôs no reasoning with him. Maybe I also feel like I don‚Äôt care enough for it to hurt me anymore. This didn‚Äôt help my ability and drive to fight back. I felt like there wasn‚Äôt any point in fighting and I soon just went with the flow. 

He is also very childish, and...stupid. He will tell me the same things over and over, the same stories, the same facts. If we drive by his bus stop, I can already hear him say ‚Äúthis is where I get off to go to work‚Äù. When he has a ‚Äúbrilliant idea‚Äù, I don‚Äôt even bother reasoning with him about it, no matter how stupid it is. Conversation is impossible with him. I literally cannot tell a joke because he doesn‚Äôt get it, unless it‚Äôs a fart joke or something. His music taste is awful, like worse than you can imagine (this is tough because I feel like my taste of music is pretty great. I am constantly looking for new music). He yell coughs, and growls randomly to ‚Äúclear his lungs‚Äù because ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt help it‚Äù (not in public...usually...thankfully). I can‚Äôt stand to be around him most of the time. And when I do it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm feeling needy for human contact and he‚Äôs familiar, and therefor predictable and safe. There are certain endearing qualities that I enjoy about him, like how he treats our pets (except how he treats our dog). Or how he doesn‚Äôt judge when I‚Äôm goofy or weird. He can be loving, and affectionate. 

Now I‚Äôm so dependent on him, I have no passport, credit card, no car, no licence. The only thing in my name is my cell phone. We also have a lot of pets that we take exceptional care of. It‚Äôs going to be the hardest thing I will ever do to give them up, especially because it‚Äôs not likely that I will find a home that takes as good care as we do. 

I‚Äôm so desperate to get out. To not have him look over my shoulder every time I get a text, or for him to not ask questions. I can‚Äôt wait to have female friends and be able to go out. I‚Äôve never lived that life.

 I can‚Äôt wait to speak with other men again, and form connections with them. Fall in love again. Enjoy intimacy again. Most of all, just be able to talk freely with them. It might sound weird but this is what I‚Äôm most excited for. 


Im also scared that after being alone for so long I‚Äôll be an outcast. I feel it already with my social interactions when I used to work. I‚Äôm awkward and kind of weird. I used to be very social and had lots of friends. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve had any real connections with anyone that I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôll be too far gone.

so i‚Äôd kinda calmed down for a few months and regained my sanity lmao.
since the breakup i found myself struggling to feel anything for anyone. it was hard. 
until i found someone that used to live here where i live, i had stalked his social media for a little because to be honest yes i was interested in him a little more then anyone else since my last and only boyfriend.

so this boy texted me from twitter one night ( i know silly) and he said some the sweetest things, we snap chatted for a little and he wanted to hangout when he visited my city, but things didn‚Äôt workout and so he went home without a chance of hanging out, uea it sucked but i was like whatever, anyway bada bing bada bang, i ended up going to see him the same day he left my city because my sister was headed home and she lives in the same state just 2 hours from us as well, so i rode with her.

me and pretty twitter boy had an amazing weekend, and i know, anyway, i ended up sleeping with him but this time i felt like it meant something rather than the few other boys that seemed to be a distraction? i guess u could call it that. so i really loved his personality and think i actually caught some feelings for him. we talked a lot after i came home but i just feel like he‚Äôs not interested. 

then again he will text me first, but make such dry conversation, but i really love his personality. Although it hurts that someone who i caught feelings for doesn‚Äôt care too much, i really am so glad he exists because even if he doesn‚Äôt care about me, he showed me i can care about someone again.

When I got friend zoned, it really upset me. I was really starting to like him and could see us going out and becoming a couple but it just didn‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs been two years since I‚Äôve been in a relationship. I had a very toxic and unhealthy one throughout highschool and I tried dating him (guy who friend zoned me) for a bit because I had a crush on him my junior year but I broke it off (it was like 3 days so maybe it is my fault and this was payback) and went back to my ex because I was naive and stupid.

I just don‚Äôt know if it was payback for that stint I did two years ago or what but I kept telling myself it was my fault or that he met someone better. Idk it‚Äôs 12:30 and I‚Äôm just saying nonsense",lonely,is it my fault?,2020-04-11 15:27:48

1968,justice5150,1586571303,1,"**I haven't had friends for many years**. I'm only 23. I've been **lonely &amp; isolated** for over **8 years**. When I was young, *I had so many friends*. I was a **leader**, I brought **people together** &amp; arranged hanging out, I didn't have to **think** about anything **social anxiety** wise. 

**This changed** when I got into high school, I don't really know why it happened then. I started **withdrawing**, **isolating**, **missing school**, not keeping up with **friends**. I felt like ***I wasn't caught up*** to everyone **maturity-wise**, &amp; I was always **very poor** so that didn't help when I saw everyone getting cars. 

***Severe Social Anxiety*** is tough to explain.

TL;DR - I feel like **everyone hates me**. I feel like **I'm being judged** by everyone, ***CONSTANTLY***, even ppl who **I don't even see**(like walking passed someones house). I always think **I'm wrong**, even if **I'm factually correct**. I always **feel like something bad is going to happen** to me, e.x. being ***embarrassed***, someone ***irrationally arguing with me***, being ***made fun of***, anything that would **make people look at me**. I always think **I have no future** because going out in public is ***so, so hard***. 

The last time I had a friend, was **well over a year ago**. It's **so hard** to **meet new people**, that ***I can't make new friends.*** 

I've been live streaming video games &amp; a podcast for 7 years, **I met thousands** of people there. I decided to use this to ***help fight my social anxiety***. It has helped **only a little**, after **7 years**, **100+ hours a week**, ***I still have a very hard time meeting new friends. I literally don't have any.***

It's **not as easy** as ""*Facing your fears is the answer*"" because I've done this for **7+ years**, even **outside**. 

*Every time I make a post like this*, I get **really really kind** &amp; **caring responses**, &amp; even people messaging me on Reddit. But, *95%* of them ***never respond*** after first message &amp; the ones that do, ***end up not responding*** after a few days. 

The people I meet from streaming, they usually **come once**, then **never again**. Some people come &amp; **keep coming**, even **every stream** for sometimes **up to months**, then one day **they never come back** &amp; **I never hear from them** **again** or **once every month** or so. 

I'm just having a hard time ***being lonely.*** **I need people**. I **need friendship**. I need to **live life**. We are ***social animals***... &amp; **I don't have anyone**. **Not even my brothers**, they are **too focused on themselves** while I take care of my very sick &amp; disabled mother by myself.

1982,TwinkieMarie72,1586564274,1,"TLDR: I feel like people act like they want to be friends, but it's just not actually happening for now and I need to let it go, completely or be disappointed always. 

This is obviously pre-covid...but...idk...I'm frustrated that I would have people that I thought I was cool with constantly try to make plans and then never follow through. Don't get me wrong, I get it. We're all human and as we get older we just get more tired and want to sit at home and chill. That's fine. But it seems the only time people wanted to go out was when it was to the bar. Which, again, I absolutely get. Let's do that, but not all the time. The same people who would always say, ""Oh, let's go do (insert a non-bar type venue...like a theme park or the roller rink or the movies...or the mall, etc..)"" would almost always cancel once I'm already at the location. or if they didn't cancel they would not show until hours later. Which if it were a party that would be fine. But this is usually for outtings where after a few hours, the hang out time is over. I'm aware that the reality is...I'm not a priority. and that's okay. it's still frustrating even if I can consciously recognize it. My next plan really is to stop sharing what I'm up to. Because I realize before when I was going out by myself, it was fine. I was happy and having a good time. I'm really just bumming myself out by putting myself in the mentality that I'm getting all hyped over having an even MORE exciting experience by hanging out with friends. This way....I'm not setting any expectations that cause me to have to rely on the presence of others for a good time to be a good time.   


since I'm venting....one recent discussion...my co-worker recently said she's thinking about doing some tik-toks and mentions she wants to do them with her, her bf, our other friends.  I said, cool. I'm down for any tik tok you want to do. You pick it, I'll learn it. I said, we should do it in our work clothes here in the lobby, since no one can sit over there anyways. She says, nooo...I want to get dressed up and look cute. AGain....I totally get this sentiment. However, I told her..nah, I'm not going to do that. YOu can get dressed up if you want and if you happen to swing by while I""m working I'm down to do it at the end of my shift before I go home. but I know if we make plans to do this, you're going to wait until the time we're supposed to get together to even get out of bed and shower and decide what to wear and how to do your makeup and hair and stop to get a coffee and snack and gas and do your taxes. and then you'll show up like 4 hours later.   


I'm just ready to do what I can with what I have at the moment. If I wanna do tik toks, either they happen right then and there/spur of the moment kinda thing or they don't.   


Another thing, they've been talking about working out and dieting for the passed year or so that I've known them. I said, okay...what's your plan. I don't mean...what is every single specific step for the next few years, just what is the general plan you're shooting for and what specific things are you going to do to get started so we can do this? To which I keep suggesting different things. One of them shared a IG post with me from this one gym. I said...okay...when are we going to try one of their classes. They said...whenever, just let me know. I said, okay. I went on the gym's IG and looked at more posts. and shared a different one with them that showed more kick boxing type moves which is what they'd expressed a strong interest in. and they responded....where is that? I said, it's the same gym you shared with me. Then they  started asking me questions, ""how far away is it? How much does it cost?""   
I don't know...let...me..just...do...all...the...googling..and research for the gym you shared with me.  
So...I went to the gym and asked questions for myself. I liked what I heard and I gave them my friend's phone number and IG, so they could find out for themselves. and any new questions that may just pop up.   


I've always shared info for anything fun and different I'm doing as an open invitation for anyone who wants to join. It'll always start the same, ""Oh! that sound like so much fun! when is that, what are the details? I want to go?!"" then when the time comes, and a lot of these experiences are like...first week trials...no sign up required, just show up and enjoy. so, It'll be opportunities all week to do whatever and whenever it's good for your schedule. and I""ll talk about ideas with people who are interested for months. so when the time finally happens, and they've spent these months talking about, ""yeah, that'll be so fun, can't wait, let's do that.""  the tune changes real quick when it's time to actually follow through.   


I'm just tired of being strung along. Maybe I'm just not their cup of tea. and they just don't feel comfortable telling me. Maybe they like having someone around that feeds their ego and wants to hang out with them but they get to make all the calls on it. I'm like a platonic side chick or something lol.   


I've spent a lot of time at home crying about it. I feel really pathetic and worthless and unloved. I don't even have much of a connection with friends from home. I try to keep in touch but I guess there's not much to share between us. I don't know. I don't want a romantic partner, I don't want a spouse. I want friends. Maybe this is the time in my life where I recreate that relationship with myself. and just enjoy experiences and learning and aging. and just enjoying the quiet.

This has been ongoing for over a year now.. I need something to break, something to change. And for fear of sounding needy, whiny and every other negative clich√© you can think of, I just want to be cared for and looked after again.

My abusive ex is off out there having moved on like it was nothing to her. Then the few attempts at throwing myself back out there when I felt I was ready have all ended in tears because people are just so goddamn dishonest!

Why build me up when I explain how fragile I am? Why let things get so far and put in so many hours if you had no intention of seeing it go anywhere? It's not like I'm pushing things!! I'm fucking terrified of things always going to shit still so dare not hope anymore, and yet each time lasts a bit longer, and something clicks... Except for me the click is positive and for you, negative.

I'm sick of being haunted by my past... I want to let it go, and u want to stop this obsession of being lonely.. It could be worse? I have a home, I have a life... And yet its not what I want...

I am so deeply rooted with this need to be able to live and be loved in that other level it drives me insane. I know it's not healthy, but I'm sick trying to go this alone. I'm referred to as 'the nice one, the kind one' and yet nobody wants to take that home with them.. And it kills me.

I don't want to turn into another one of the selfish masses, and I don't think it's too much to ask for someone to care in return not because they have to, but because they want to, and I'm enough for them like they would be for me?

I'm just so royally fed up, and I can't seem to claw my way back out of the pit anymore. I don't have the strength or the willpower anymore, and yet I know that only makes my problem worse.

I'm just so fed up... So done... And I honestly don't know what to do any more... I just want this to be over, and to be able to curl up in the arms of someone and just cry this shit out and be held... I miss being close for the sake of it...

Fast forward to a few months later, then the crap started. I was bullied, a lot, A LOT, everyday it was for a new reason. We have a small race here in India called the Tamilians, and I lived in a city where people from the same heritage were hated ( for this and many other reasons I did not know), and every single day I was bullied to death, beaten up, verbally abused for absolutely no reason at all. Every single day in school was hell to me. Some people miss their school, i am afraid of mine. Nobody was ever friends with me, so one day I made up a story about having visited and resided in the USA, for some reason everybody suddenly wanted to talk to me, asked me about how it was, for once I had people who wanted to talk to me. So I continued forging story after story, filled end to end with lies, and never stopped. To this day people know me as someone who's partially American. I was never really good at anything, at all, no sports, I play video games with a few friends, but I'm always made fun of because I suck. Everytime I try to soul my guys about why I'm sad I get labelled as an attention seeker or sympathy seeker and get made fun of and ignored again. Until today I haven't done a single thing that makes my parents proud to state the fact that I am their son, I've always ended up disappointing my father, who worked very very hard to bring us to the comfort we have now. You don't even have to ask me about my love life, topping this all off with around 12-14 rejections all from various diff girls. All I ever want is for people to like me and consider me as a friend. I have never had someone who I can call my best friend, and he or she the same. Havent had anyone except family show any sort of concern about me. I'm 19 now, and I am still made fun of all the time, still lonely, still powerless, still, a loser. I've always had dreams or goals, but I could never achieve them, my mother thought I was messed up in the head and took me through a psych analysis.

tw: suicide, child abuse, pretty melodramatic of me, sad boi monologue, etc.

I feel like I've just accepted my life is happier lonely because the few times I get close to people, it doesn't really end well. The guy I blocked? We were really close friends. I wish I had never been genuine with him, that I had given him the fake persona I give everyone else. He should have never known me. He was insensitive, but I overlooked it, I guess. He said he wasn't scared to tell me anything on his mind because he felt like our friendship was unbreakable. He said he cares more about the intention than the consequences. I finally blocked him after he said ""I kind of miss fighting death with you."" 

He missed the suicidal me. He was a kind person, but he has flaws too. He's clingy because his close friend died a while back, and he hasn't recovered from that trauma. He says he can't live without other people because he lives through them. 

I told him to grow to become his own person. Not to live through me. I wanted him to have a good life. Now that I'm essentially dead to him, I hope he learns to become a person he can be proud of. A person who can live for himself. I hate him so much, but I want him to live a happier life because I think he deserves to be happy. I hope we never meet again, not in this life or the next. 

People have told me to live because I'm a redeemable person. Because I'm a good girl. Because I'm going to have a good life. If I can't live for myself, then for others. But I just feel so empty inside. Even though I've taken antidepressants, switched medicines, had therapy, I'm still hollow. 

I guess I'm just typing this all because I feel so desolate. I'm sorry for all the contradictions about my feelings in this post. I just want to tell somebody. Please don't tell me I have my whole life in front of me, that I can be happy, that people will be good and I will experience life. I know that. I'm fortunate. I have food, shelter, family, more than a lot of people have. I just don't have love. 

So I'll keep living day by day until I can't bear it anymore. I'm going to try and go to college and find a chance in life, away from all the hurt that's at home. I'm going to be poor because of college. I'm going to be hollow inside like I've always been. Maybe someday life will show me what it's like to be happy, to feel normal. Maybe it won't. 

I have a little bit of hope left. I want to learn to take advantage of the life I've been given. I'm lucky to be alive while others die, to have food while others starve, to have a family (even if they're shitty) when others don't, to have a chance to go to college when others might not. I want to honor what I do have, as dull and empty as it is to live every day. I am lucky.

I saved both of them in a way. I had this need to fix them and make them better people, and I did, for the most part. I can credit myself on that. However now I am at a loss. As I have only aged more now, (Currently only 18) I'm only growing more and more distanced from those around me, and more and more cripplingly self aware.

I am incredibly lonely. It hurts to admit it, to be honest. Some days all I think about is how to end it all, how there is no real point to me being alive now that the only two goldfish I ever loved have moved on and become incredible and independent people. Occasionally I do talk to them, the boy more lately however it's not the same. I can't even pretend. Not to myself, and not to them. I'm too honest.

From the bottom of my heart, I genuinely don't mean to come across as cocky or ignorant, I'm a pretty weird and goofy person normally, and I definitely don't usually type like this lol. I guess this is the more self aware side of me coming out of the facade. Shouting into the void that is reddit.

Anyway. Maybe someone can relate. Although I'm not even really seeking that. Guess I just wanted to admit it to someone other than myself in my head.",lonely,I feel like i'm too smart for anybody I meet.,2020-04-10 22:35:47

2025,EyesLikeBlueSky,1586515287,1,"Got dumped last week by my gf of 3 years who habitually ghosted me off and on. Constantly she would assure me everything was ok/good and that it was just work and school getting to her and I didn't want to believe something was wrong because I trusted her and whenever we did hang out/talk things were magical and amazing. If anything was wrong I was sure she'd come to me and we could work things out, I told her this from the start of our relationship and throughout it I offered her help, money, a place to stay, advice, anything.

I gave 110% of my love, loyalty and trust to this lady and firmly believe we would turn things around and be back to how good our relationship was in the first 4/5 months. I always talked so nicely to her, and to my friends about how great of a person she is and how lucky I am to have met her. Nobody really wanted me before her and no one will after. And now it's pretty obvious that she didn't really want me either because she got a new BF and didn't tell me until I messaged her. I was just supposed to magically find out or psychically know I guess. 

So that was wrong and now I'm alone again. It wouldn't be so bad if all the family I have wasn't dying/passed on and all my friends wouldn't ghost me all the time. I have no one to talk to about stuff almost every day and people I used to spend time with and talk to constantly just never bother anymore. Sometimes it feels like they wouldn't reach out at all if I didn't message them first, and even when they do respond it's only out of pity/boredom.

The hard truth I've had to swallow for like 5-8 years is that the people who do love and care about me are old and will all be gone soon, while the people who i call friends/my ex couldn't give a shit how I feel or how much having them around means to me personally. I'm just a nice distraction for maybe a week or month, and after that just someone to ghost and ignore. Frankly I'm just completely tired of trying to make new friends and my family makes me beyond pissed 99% of the time. 

I haven't been happy in so long, and my life feels like it's been in decline since 3rd grade. Typing this out didn't make me feel better, just I guess confirms to me what I've been dreading was true all along.

I can't reread Harry Potter because it became an us thing. I can't sit down to play piano because the last song I learned was for us to perform together, and now her voice will never give words to the melody. I can't play Animal Crossing because I used to play it while talking to her on the phone. Everything that was familiar and comforting feels robbed of its home-y value now because she's not there.

2054,ThrowAway47384729923,1586489702,1,"I often see pretty girls and just fantasize about doing sweet things I could do for them (if I knew them) like bringing her flowers and imaging what her smile will look like. Or maybe seeing their look when I show up to bring her food at her job. I also sometimes find myself seeing a cute girl who is texting on her phones with a smile on her face and just thinking how beautiful it is to see her happy. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll catch a girl in the middle of some quirky little thing they do that is unique or memorable about them, and I just think how beautiful people can be when no one is looking, while they‚Äôre just existing. You know‚Ä¶just those cute little things people do.

And then I snap out of it and realize I‚Äôll never have any of that, or be able to do any of those things and it hurts so bad. Thinking about it produces a rush of emotion within me that I can PHYSICALLY feel in my chest, and I become overwhelmed by sadness.

It‚Äôs weird but I‚Äôm kinda addicted to feeling sad from this. I‚Äôm not sure why but I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so internally dead, that feeling emotions, ANY emotions Is kind of a reminder. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm emotionally dead inside and so anything that produces an emotional reaction (in a stranger, dark way) reminds me that I‚Äôm not entirely dead inside and that I am still
able to feel something ‚Äî anything, even if it‚Äôs deep sadness.

It‚Äôs something that exacerbates my depression and social anxiety. Which in turn makes it difficult to connect with other people. I always hear women say, ‚Äúfix yourself‚Äù. Sometimes we just have to accept that we are not always fixable, and that that‚Äôs ok. But I also think that people who fall into that category like myself owe it to themselves to find a way to cope. To me that means I have given up on relationships. I‚Äôm too damaged to be boyfriend material and now that I‚Äôve realize this, things have gotten a little better. I didn‚Äôt know this at the time, but my depression and social anxiety has kept me from even talking to women. I don‚Äôt approach women in public. I don‚Äôt interact with them at work or other settings unless I absolutely have to. I‚Äôm short and ugly so I know no woman is going to be interested in talking to me. So in a way, my social anxiety help me ‚Äústay out of the way‚Äù of women.

This all kind of happened over many years and now it‚Äôs been 12 years since my last relationship. I think about suicide often, but then I realize at least I still have ONE thing left: I can still fantasize about those smiles and looks of happiness on a cute girls face while knowing I will never have the chance or confidence to do any of the sweet gestures to make that happen.

2076,guitarnerd420,1586475821,1,"Hi, I'm a 24 yr old dude and I don't really have anyone to talk to. Today wasn't a very good day, I've been in a bad mood lately and it seems like everything makes me upset. I haven't talked to anyone in a long time, I live with my brother but he works a fair amount and I am pretty unemployed. I do freelance work and have not worked much in the past year and now with the state of the world I have no upcoming gigs or prospects. I spend almost all of my time home alone. 

About 2 years ago I met this girl who I worked with,  we ended up becoming pretty good friends and I found myself with quite the crush on her. She told me that I was quiet  and that I needed to talk more, and when I did talk she seemed to always listen and genuinely be interested in what I had to say. I told her that I was working on my being quiet and shy and she was supportive of it. I guess I've always been quiet as a kid, but ever since I left highscool and moved away from my home town I've been trying to be more social and talk to people and I honestly though I was doing good. I didn't consider myself to be the quiet kid I was in highschool anymore. But twice in the past 3 years people have called me quiet, this girl and another co-worker on another occasion.  

anyways long story short the gig I was working on with this girl was a bit of an unorganized shit show and her time on the gig got cut short because the company we were working for is always cutting corners to save money and they dropped crew to reduce cost.  I think I was a bit too honest with the company when I told them  my opinion of what they were doing because now they don't call me. So basically this company just kinda ghosted me after I worked for them for like 2 years, so that kinda pisses me off that they didn't even say anything I just kinda got the message when they never called again.   

Anyways this girl who I had the crush on, we continued talking when we were done working, texting and on the phone, I think we both felt fucked over by this company so we could relate on that level. In August of 2019 I was looking for more work as my gigs were winding down so I got coffee with her and asked her for career advice because we work in the same field. She said she could help me, that she could hire me to help her with some stuff she had going on and other things. One of the things she said to me was to keep her in the loop with my life and she told me to not give up.

Ok so talking to people and getting coffee together and just socializing in general causes me a lot of anxiety. so anytime I called her or texted her or went to see her it caused me a lot of anxiety, but I pushed through it because I really liked her and I wasn't gonna let myself get in my own way and ruin it.

So I texted her one day and asked her if she wanted to get coffee this saturday, which again made me very nervous. and then she didn't reply to me, so I was like ok fine. then she got back to me 6 days later after saturday had passed and was like ""sorry for the late reply, sure we can get together soon"" so I relied "" I'm busy until Tuesday and would be down to do something then"" she never replied to me and I haven't spoken to her since August. 

So that whole situation really hurt my feelings because she told me I was shy and quiet and that she was trying to help me and be sort of a big sister, and then when I tried to talk to her she just ghosted me. So I was like I don't want to talk to someone who ignores me so I'm not gonna talk to you. but the thing is I haven't really talked to anyone since august and everyday I want to call her and talk, but I can not put myself through the anxiety of texting someone and hoping for a response just to be let down. So as a result I sort of stopped talking to people because I just don't want to get my hopes up anymore, especially when people just think I'm quiet.  

I guess I just want someone in my life that actually thinks of me, no one has texted me in almost a year and today I was really frustrated because I have no one to talk to so I threw my phone behind my couch so I couldn't see it because what is the point in having a phone if no one ever contacts me. now my phone is broken the screen doesn't work but no one texts me anyway.",lonely,no one to talk to,2020-04-10 09:43:41

I don't have any friends at college, I only had a few on my freshman year and since then I haven't talk to anyone on a friendly manner.

Why is this important? My last two relationships were girls I met on my high school, I lasted about two years with each one. 
I do have some close friends from middle and high school, but I don't hang with them irl, only on discord and messenger.

The people I got to talk to during the last two years were my ex's friends

Even though I like being alone (it's relaxing and calm) I don't want to feel lonely, I was ""fixing"" those things with my therapist, but we only got about half of the normal therapy, she was the only person who I would talk my problems to.

Why do I share this with you?
Why do I compare myself with others
Why do I try to become attached 

Do I make me or do others make me
Who is this person in the mirror -- his colors change bright and dark everyday, causing confusion 
There's a fire inside of him and it burns but he doesn't know why

He feels that he has to search, but for what?
As time goes, so does his patience 

He wants to be left alone but he doesn't want to be lonely

Wishing... Wishing for detachment.
He plays the game that he hates because he doesnt have the courage to quit

2113,ScotlandKing,1586447223,3,"Sorry if this is really shitty to read im jusg trying to get a bunch of stuff off my chest. Feel free to skip if you dont want to read the ramblings of an idiot.

When I was in highschool I had friends and life was good, wed hang out at lunch chat after school and life was good, later in the year I met an amazing person, they were kind, funny, smart, got my weird sense of humour and soon enough I worked up the courage to ask them to be my first romantic relationship.

 Life was good for the first 3 years but friendships end and people drift apart and it seemed they mostly drifted away from me, over and over I would find myself losing people I thought were close. I dont blame them cuz I know for the most part it was me but through out it all one person stayed and I was still happy with just that person, but as more people left I started to question why they stayed and it started tormenting me.

At the beginning of uni these thoughts of self doubt about the relationship finally manifested into me breaking things off. We remained friends that soon moved to friends with benefits because the feelings never truly went away. But as im sure many of you know things never end well in these situations.

After the breakup I felt like something was missing so I tried dating around for a bit but never seemed to find someone to fill the void left by them, they on the other hand remained single almost hinting that they were waiting for me to get over the self doubt and come back. But finally I found someone I thought would fill that void and things were going great for me and at the same time they found someone else. We both agreed to see what happens with our new relationships but vowed to stay friends no matter what.

This worked for a bit we, still chatted and talked about how we were feeling about the new change in our lives and how we were coping but soon enough the self doubt crept back up. I wondered if i had made the right decision with breaking up. But eventually I snapped and ended up pushing them away telling them to never contact me again and I went ghost, removed myself from there life the way I felt they should leave mine.

It has now been 2 months since then and I dont think I have ever felt this alone. It feels like there is no one around to talk to who will understand me, it feels like there is a pit in my stomach that cannot be filled and it hurts. Recently I tried messaging them but was left on read so I took that as my final goodbye to them.

Through out all this I know that I am the one to blame and dont expect nor deserve there sympathy or pity, they gave me plenty while they were in my life and I didnt properly appriciate it. I just wish I could take back the last few years of my life and make things better but I know that that time has passed.

10 years later, it hurts to see how great he is doing. Not because I dislike him or don't want him to be happy, but because he is a *mirror* to what I could have been. He is very toned and regularly posts on Instagram. Then he will get on the order of 500 likes and comments from buff dudes calling him King and sending fire emojis and girls fawning over him. He regularly goes clubbing or to festivals with groups of friends. He goes to a lot of house parties and from what I heard from him they are pretty wild. When he was 16 I met up with him for a night and he talked about all the girls that were chasing him (not surprising judging his social market value) and how happy he is.

Meanwhile I feel empty. I have been through so much shit and social rejection during my teen years that I feel like I can never recover from it. This dude has been banging girls and having the time of his life since he was like 14 or what. We started out the same as kids but he clearly surpassed me long ago. I cannot imagine posting a pic of me and receiving endless validation and girls storming my inbox with heart emojis. I can't imagine having a different activity with great people to look forward to every month. Our lives are so vastly different, I bet we cannot imagine being in each other's shoes.

Recently I cut off my main social circle due their toxicity and how shit they made me feel everytime I brought something up.

The amount of shit they rained down on me because I cancelled on them because of that (they texted a bunch of other shit too), it made me realise this is the moment to now finally cut them off. 

Even though I do have friends it‚Äôs not the same as having a close circle, who you‚Äôd hang out with all the time. I don‚Äôt have a main social circle anymore, I don‚Äôt have people who I‚Äôd think of first to message if something happens, good or bad. 

Believe me when I say I‚Äôm glad I cut those friends off but now I‚Äôm in a situation where I feel alone.

I could call my sister but doing that always just ends up depressing me, she's working at minimum wage while also learning and she's always incredibly tired, out of some kind of weird kindness or obligation she'll talk to me for five minutes if I call before she'll end the conversation. It's not a fun dynamic. Point is I'm lonely. I'm also stressed, although my life is as stress free as it gets I'm still stressed, maybe it's anxiety I don't know. I tried taking antidepressants very briefly but they made me feel completely dead inside so I stopped pretty quickly. The anxiety was very much gone though, I don't know, maybe I should have just accepted feeling dead inside cause if I'm dead inside I can work, and I can be fine with being a loser in life, and I'm not anxious. Sounds like a good deal I don't know. And right now life is as easy as it gets for me.

Maybe I won't be as miserable at a telecenter or a pizza shop as I am in school. It's easier I think. I try not to think about all this but it's hard. I used to always say to myself that I want to die and that I suck, but the truth is, I don't want to die and sucking is subjective. I don't hate myself. I don't think I'm a bad person for being lazy and anxious and alone and a loser. It's fine, I've accepted all the bad things about me and I try to just do what I can do, I make food, I like making food, and I like eating food that I make more than I like eating chips.

2136,LederhosenLeprechaun,1586421542,1,"I may have been feeling lonely lately, but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm pretty damn fortunate to have friends that I can count on, hang out with, share memes and ideas with, as well as corny ass jokes that I enjoy getting a few laughs out of them for. 

I have a friend that I‚Äôve had since High School. One that I can talk with without need for a filter that I usually put on around strangers. I can tell fucked up jokes with him and game with him, and just be someone a lot closer to who I really am. He‚Äôs very brutally honest with me, and he‚Äôs never afraid to speak his mind on stuff. He‚Äôs pretty much like the older brother I never really had, and I look up to him and wish to be a bit more like him.

I have a female friend who is almost 10 years older than me, but who I can also be myself around. I game with her and mess with her whenever we‚Äôre in an online party together, and I can even vent to her about stuff going on, but that applies to the previous person as well. She doesn‚Äôt judge me much, if at all for who I am, and I can rely on her for advice because I trust her word due to how honest she tends to be, no matter the occasion.

I have another friend who‚Äôs about 3-4 years older than me, and he‚Äôs in a relationship with another one of my friends. He‚Äôs super nice, but also straightforward and truthful with most people including myself. He‚Äôs also quiet like I am, and kind of like the first guy, I see him as a nicer version of my older brother. He‚Äôs someone I aspire to be in the future.

I have another female friend who happens to be the above persons girlfriend, and I can honestly say there is no better pairing of people I can possibly think of. She‚Äôs incredibly nice and super upbeat, but can be blunt when the situation calls for it, which I learned once I got to know her more. I share corny jokes with her, joke around with her at work, and I listen to her vent about problems on the occasion where it‚Äôs needed, and she does the same for me. She‚Äôs honestly part of the reason I came to this conclusion recently. She helped me realize how many friends I really had, and how much I‚Äôve foolishly doubted myself for not seeing that. I never stopped to see just how many genuine friends I actually had until she helped me see the truth. And for that, I‚Äôm honestly grateful to have her, as well as the others I‚Äôve mentioned or didn‚Äôt mention as friends.

All these people in particular, as well as a few others, have all been pushing me in their own ways to become a better person than I already am. I may not be as bad as I‚Äôve been thinking I am lately, but I still have a ways to go, and I think I will for a while.

Tbh, there‚Äôs still that voice in my head planting seeds of doubt in my mind, trying to convince me that everything I‚Äôm saying rn is just bullshit to trick myself into thinking that I‚Äôm better. That all my problems that I‚Äôm dealing with are just magically gone. But I know they‚Äôre not. I know they‚Äôre still there. They‚Äôre stubborn little fucks. But now I have a reason to fight back. I have more to fight for than I realize. If I die, who‚Äôs gonna keep the first guy I mentioned company when no one else is available? Who‚Äôs gonna tease the second person I mentioned and make her laugh with my somewhat unique brand of smartass, dorky humor? Sure others probably could, but no other dorks she knows will be able to do it quite like I do. Same also applies to the third guy. And if I die, I‚Äôm pretty sure the 4th person is gonna bring me back to life and kick my ass for dying on her. Or she‚Äôll just never forgive me, but I don‚Äôt exactly want either of those to happen.

Honestly, a year ago didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to say any of this in the future. But lo and behold, here I am doing just that. And now I think I can finally say my goodbyes to this sub. I hope everyone here can reach a point where they become this fortunate, because everyone needs a friend or two. And I have plenty of those.

This is actually my first time posting anything on Reddit, excuse my lack of Reddit lingo. My purpose for coming here is in hoping to find someone to talk to that is either going through the same situation or once was or just to get to know me. I‚Äôll make this short as possible.
I‚Äôm 32 male, meet my love in 2006, we got married 12yrs later. We have 4 beautiful babies. My oldest son is from previous relationship. Perfect, right? She fell out of love for me because I didn‚Äôt put enough attention to her, it was always work work work for me. I admit, I could have done better for her. A woman needs that eye contact communication and the right affection. I learned that the hard way when she had told me she was in love with someone else about 2 years now. I asked her why did you marry me then do this to us? She said she just wanted someone to talk to because I made her feel like she was invisible. She was such a beautiful loving caring person and I didn‚Äôt know what I had. I got laid off work a week after she told me and my oldest son 14 couldn‚Äôt stand seeing his father look so weak crying to my wife.

But it seems like yesterday
It happened the strangest way
My first love affair

Summer day
I'm swimming alone in the ocean
When suddenly I got a notion
That someone was watching

And I turned to see who was there...

I saw this
Beautiful lady, beautiful lady
Only a heartbeat away from me
Two seashell earrings were all that she wore

She was smiling and saying to me

Come away
I'll show you my home in the ocean
And stranger, if you get a notion
That you'd like to love me

Well, just do what you feel, do what you feel

Mermaid, mermaid
I want you but I'm afraid
Part fish, part girl
I don't fit your world

Mermaid, mermaid
I want you but I'm afraid
Part fish, part girl
Oohh

She put her
Sweet arms around me, sweet arms around me
Ever so gently, she put me down
Next thing I knew was the soft ocean floor

And the first taste of love that I found

Let me stay
I'll live in your home in the ocean
I'll give you my love and devotion
But suddenly she told me

You must go back and find
A girl of your kind
So I left her behind
Now the ocean reminds me of

Mermaid, mermaid
It's true love that we made
Part fish, part girl
I still miss your world

Mermaid, mermaid
It's true love that we made
Part fish, part girl
I still miss your world

Mermaid, mermaid
It's true love that we made
Part fish, part girl
I still miss your world

Mermaid, mermaid
It's true love that we made
Part fish, part girl
I still miss your world

I message/they message ---&gt; we chat ----&gt; ""oh we should play x"" ----&gt; they ghost and eventually dip

It's hard for me because I've been used in the past and rarely had a stable friendship. I try to overcome that anxiety by putting effort into things, but it never seems to be worth it. People say online friends are just as valuable as irl friends, and I agree with that. I just wish I had those. 

I don't know if it's something about me or people just lose interest in me that fast. Then again, I guess there isn't much to me. I write and game. That's about it. I wish I had close friends that aren't clingy/desperate or distant/ghosting, but genuine people that want to get to know me. It's a lot to ask for, but it's wishful thinking. 

It also sucks because I get snarky comments for making ""looking for friends"" posts because I'm a girl. Like the ""oh we know why she's getting messages"" and shit like that. I'm so sick of having to struggle to find someone who will just value me as a person and I can do the same. I don't want to be used again.

2154,hamartiated,1586403069,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

She would tell me these things that made me think we will be long term, oh ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go camping this summer!‚Äù 
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go on a road trip sometime, I‚Äôd love to be with you‚Äù 

‚ÄúI want our first time to be something special...I KNOW! I‚Äôll rent out a room for you and treat you right üòÅ‚Äù

And much more....
Even on our last hangout you told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking to anyone and I hope you aren‚Äôt either...I‚Äôd be very jealous if you did ‚Äú

‚ÄúBut just know I don‚Äôt want a relationship right now‚Äù



It‚Äôs been almost a month without your presence around me...
At first I was addicted...I was devastated when you stopped talking to me
I began to wonder what I did wrong...why did she leave. Did she expect my personality to be something else? 

You would always tell me ‚Äúwe can try that next time, we got all the time ‚Äú 

Even on our last date you made it seem like you were ganna come back...leaving your groceries in my trunk saying you‚Äôll pick em up next time
Even leaving your own TP in my car for the next time we do the deed....you played me so well...I was so hooked

Then POOF! You just go MIA and I start to withdrawal from my addiction. I was upset 
But I slowly realized I need to be treated better....I don‚Äôt deserve this feeling you‚Äôve given me....all I‚Äôve ever done was treat you right....got your spirit up to levels unimaginable. I supported you emotionally....physically...mentally 

I satisfied your needs and I didn‚Äôt even care about my needs, as long as you were happy I was ecstatic.

Then TWO whole ass weeks of ignoring me you message me randomly (she worded it nicely but this was basically an arrow to the heart ) 

HEY DUMBASS! I found someone else to keep me company so I don‚Äôt need you anymore, thanks for helping me feel better tho! ü§™ oh btw, I only sent this so u won‚Äôt make it awkward at work, ha! Later 


But by the time U sent that message I was over you....I saw through your bullshit, I wasn‚Äôt fogged up by my loving passion anymore. 


But even to this day...I get jealous when I see hints of you having someone else....whenever I‚Äôm not doing anything to distract my mind I begin to wonder....how did this all go wrong....our last text looked so normal 


I miss your presence....I‚Äôve chased so much....and have seen no good outcome....


But I still want you to know I care for you and I loved you, and still do, as a friend. I want you to know that I will always be here for you....but messaging you even more, trying to fuel back our relationship only makes me seem desperate and you don‚Äôt even seem remotely close to interested",lonely,[VENT]‚ÄúWe got all the time in the world‚Äù -S. ‚Äúain‚Äôt no sunshine when she‚Äôs gone‚Äù-Bill W.,2020-04-09 11:06:06

I must tell me as every human being I live in a fairness balance of divergent emotion

Trying with all my acquired forces to drive-apart my insecurities;

I'm afraid to say,I am insecure about my-self.

In a continuous contrast of sorrow emotion. I need help to understand my emotion, the world is so complicated.

Because we made it, we want happiness, but we undervalue ourselves,

Sorrow thoughts in my mind concern me every single breath,

Scared to not be the same person, fascinating by the future, 

But scared to death by its own destiny.

Listening, watching,observing;This actions make me contemplate my ID.

I need someone who understand me who knows how to deal with my insecurities.

I'm not scared to die alone I am scared to die without none except me!

Why we live in a world of hypocrisy?

Why we cannot deal without the masks created by us for the society?

i am not longer appreciating the sadly fun pleasures,i am discovering probably what it means grow, living and dying

i have big plans i want big plans,i can't afford a trivial life.

Uncomfortable silence provoke me silence, a plenty emotion of disturbing fullness. Why I cannot afford something i want so valuable, which i might not be able to deal with it.

Sometimes i struggle to follow my routes, like a boat without a captain in the storm.

Living as a free bird is beautiful but concern me if would you remember me.

Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more - OCD. I'm always doing it for many years now.

Don't go close to others - Fine because I always tried to avoid even one-to-one meets as well, not even crowded places.

2192,nazzy72,1586356893,1,"Feels odd, missing out on teenage love; and later, love in general, doesn't it? I remember classmates and friends in high school talking relationships, their first kiss, exploring their bodies, sex. And how those who did were thought of as the 'cool' ones, until there only were a few lagging behind. We were impressionable little children. How much of a big deal it was back then, and how much of a big deal it still is. To me, to us. University felt and still feels completely different. Walking into lecture rooms with dozens of people realising you are one of the few ones  ‚Äî and may very well be the only one ‚Äî missing out.  
    
Feels odd that I realise I'll never be able to experience teenage love, in its purest form. The awkward, infantile teenage love. That first kiss in junior year. Having sex later on. If love is to be, never will it be so pure.  
    
Feels odd, how love is everywhere, in the air, even. Can't go a few hours without seeing happy couples/sex/anything-it-may-be on advertisements, movies, online, the media, the outside world. Everywhere. Because it just is such a commodity, such a basic human need.    
On a side-note: feels odd, being schizophrenic and not even being able to trust your own senses, let alone anything else. Time is yet to show the future, but it has only shown me not so far. I want to know what love, those warm feelings, having someone love back feels like just as much as I want to know what heartbreak and pain feel like. As they are all part of feeling and being a human. Something I don't feel I am.  
The concept of age seems odd to me, but being an adult and knowing that regarding relationships I am not even an infant yet feels even more strange. I find it unreal that I missed out on so much and that I might on so much more. Never getting to experience the lovely feelings of marriage or becoming a father are scary thoughts.  
My heart is about to explode from all the fascination and love I have for this world. It's full, and it always has been full. And at the same time, it's always been empty,  for never has it received any of that fascination or love back. As someone else put it in some other post, I am ""the genetic scum that gets washed out with every generation.""   
The numbers on the calendar change and time is ever so merciless.    


Then again, feels odd that I indeed realise I know nothing, especially about the future. That everything may change and I have no way of knowing that ‚Äî or the opposite ‚Äî (un)fortunately. Hope is something that I always have, and hope feels terrible. I don't know whether I'd prefer to have it be justified for once, or completely gone. But in the end, I won't stop trying.

That one was my favorite, however thanks to being single and craving interaction and love, and being rejected by every girl I like, friends betraying me, I'm not good enough for anyone. 2016-2019 were some of the worst years for me,  and 2020 is not much better.

2203,kindacoping,1586339400,1,"So I like to cosplay and I regularly attend cosplay events and I have a bunch of friends across my country who attend said events too and we cosplay together at every major event that happens and a bunch of them got together to take a pic in cosplay and make a motivational collab image during lockdown to encourage others but they totally left me out. 
Most of the people in the picture are good friends  of mine and some of them cosplay way less frequently than I do and do much lower effort cosplays than me but they were asked to join and no one thought to even mention this was happening to me.
Literally all my cosplay buddies whom I run into and spend time with every event and talk to regularly were part of it and I was the only one who was left out. I don‚Äôt know why and I don‚Äôt think it was intentional but I still feel so bitter and angry that they left me out like that.
Maybe I just don‚Äôt mean anything to the people who mean something to me. I don‚Äôt really have any friends or anyone who isn‚Äôt family who cares about me. 

The only friend of mine who I love a lot and am comfortable with wouldn‚Äôt actually care if I was alive or dead and they let me sit alone during lunch because they wanted to suck up to their new friends who don‚Äôt like me. 

I‚Äôm so angry and bitter because I get left out for everything all the time! When there was no lockdown everyone would be hanging out together while I sat and watched their Instagram stories.
This friend of mine I just mentioned didn‚Äôt have a few hours of a day to hang out with me because they were ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù but somehow had an entire week to go on holidays with their new friends. 

Now, during lockdown, no one texts me back or maintains conversation and I have no one to call up and talk to either while everyone else is on a zoom call with 30 buddies of theirs. It‚Äôs so unfair! 

I just want to escape from this place and start afresh somewhere people like me and want me around; but no matter where I‚Äôve been in life I‚Äôve never had any real friends or people who liked me. 
So maybe the problem is with me but I still hope that someday I will find people who won‚Äôt leave me out and fake friendships with me just to be polite or because of pity.",lonely,"All the cosplayers I regularly cosplay with did a thing and didn‚Äôt even invite me or tell me it was happening! :( {Rant Post, sorry!}",2020-04-08 19:50:00

For those of who have not heard: 

-I am a 23 year old straight male virgin which is probably a major turn off for women
- I'm only 5'8
- I have never been in a relationship or a date
- I have never asked a girl out because I never feel like I am good enough and I am so socially inept
- I don't really have any friends. In fact i have never really had any friends (I never get invited to anything unless it is the rare occasion of an open invitation)
- when I do go I am always the wallflower...that awkward boy standing in the corner
- I used to get made fun of a lot back in k to 12 which really took away my confidence and I have been a sad wallflower my whole life
- My loneliness led me to having an addiction to pornography (a lot better now)
- in college AT BEST I made some acquaintances I'm cool with
- I used to get suicidal thoughts occasionally (but have never even come close to attempting, so I'm good. Though I have an imaginary gf that I use as a coping mechanism. How pathetic of me, I know)
- I'm socially inept and I don't know how to flirt whatsoever
- I have class 1 obesity
- I recently graduated college (May 2019) and started a new job in a new city a few months ago. I was hoping this would be my fresh start but it definitely hasn't been so far


So there is the laundry list. I have talked about it before, and the usual responses are: 
- I should get mental help (still feel weird about this one)
- I should work out (this quarantine though üò¨)
- I should find hobbies to meet people with similar interests (yeah, I dunno how that will happen these days)

And so on. If you have ever taken the time to give me advice on what I should do, just know I truly appreciate it.

My question right now, however, is how on Earth should I proceed? 

I havent had any real friends since 6th grade (haven't even gotten a Facebook happy birthday in the past 7/8 years...lol) and my dating/sexual experience is straight up zero. Even 15 year olds have had girlfriends and been on dates. I'm 23...24 in July. All the women around my age would expect me to have pretty good experience but I don't even have a modicum of an electron of experience. 

Where do I even begin to begin? How do I proceed? It all feels so confusing. What things should say? How should I say it? What are all the steps? What am I even supposed to do? I'm too old to be taking baby steps at this point. Every year goes by and I feel lonelier and lonelier, which makes me feel shittier and shittier, and makes me less and less confident. Everyone keeps telling me to have confidence, but I can't just create this social confidence from scratch when it's broke and still deteriorating. Sometimes I feel like there is something horribly wrong with me that everyone but me knows of.

Tl;dr: I'm 23 years old who is social inept and a virgin, but I am trying to figure our how to proceed. If the answer is ""do nothing because there is no point now"", let me know.",lonely,Just need to vent,2020-04-08 13:09:57

2234,literallyaspoon,1586314380,1,"This is a long post mainly just for me to rant, so if you don't want to spend ages reading about my crappy life you have been warned.  


I can't believe I'm actually writing this. I always thought I could just power through loneliness and come out the other side if I just toughed it out long enough. That is definitely not the case anymore. Last night I just... I broke. Everything was going normal, I was talking to some people I know over discord and my laptop froze. Okay I thought, that happens all the time because it's an old laptop on it's way out. I restarted it so I could get back to talking to them and in the 40 seconds to a minute I was gone all of them had left the channel. They had taken the first fucking opportunity they got to ditch me and go to a private server.  


I didn't understand. I thought we were getting along well... but they just straight up ditched me as soon as they could. It was the last tiny thing that broke me. I started crying, which hasn't happened in weeks and I just couldn't stop. It was about 4AM and everyone was asleep except me. I was just crying my eyes out and hyperventilating without even trying to be quiet anymore. I kept trying to stop myself from crying by listening to music, moving around my room and looking at Reddit but nothing helped. After about 40 minutes I tried pacing because that normally helps me calm down and think but as soon as I stood up my legs gave out and I just fucking collapsed on the floor and kept crying harder than before with my head in my hands. My ears started ringing and I just wanted to fucking SCREAM at the top of my voice.   


This was the 50th time this week something like this had happened. One of the only friends I have in real life had blown me off to talk to other people when he said he would talk to me about 5 FUCKING TIMES in one week and didn't even try hiding it. I could literally see that he was in a party with other people on Xbox and had made it invite only so I couldn't join. On top of that everyone I know never even bothers talking to me. I always have to start the conversation and they mostly never even bother replying. I literally have not spoken to someone for months once just because he didn't feel replying to me was worth the time. I am just fucking sick of people ignoring me, or saying we are friends and just FUCKING FORGETTING I EXIST FOR MONTHS ON END. They try and say they care but THEY JUST DON'T. I am literally just a fucking ghost to everyone else on earth. Everyone around me is always complaining that they can't talk to their friends because of quarantine, or that they are having relationship problems with their girlfriends and boyfriends and I am just there wishing I had a single fucking friend in this shitty world.

When I finally managed to stand up I thought about going to the bathroom to dry my eyes and calm down. I walked over to the door and just... stopped. I was completely unable to leave my room. As stupid as it sounds I just could not reach out and grab the handle. I don't even know why I couldn't do it, I wasn't afraid or anything but every time I reached out to grab the door handle my hand froze and I couldn't open the door. I slumped against the wall and started hyperventilating again, but faster than before. I couldn't see past my own tears and I just wanted to stop existing right then and there. It took me about 10 minutes just to grab the door handle, and at least 5 more to actually open the damn thing. I walked over to my bathroom, barely able to see from crying so much and looked in the mirror. What I saw was what destroyed me. I looked so weak, so sad, and so utterly broken. I just stared at my reflection and cried. I actually could not believe what I was seeing. I had convinced myself I would be fine one day, that I just had to tank the hits until I got better.  


I am definitely NOT okay, I am breaking the fuck apart and quicker than I can handle. Some people have said to me I need meds and a therapist... I think they are right, but I can't let my family know about this. I have been hiding my emotions for years and I have lied myself into a corner that I can't get out of. I have never had a real friend and I am so fucking lonely and I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE. Can someone please tell me what the hell to do, I am so lost and I am losing it so quickly that I cannot cope anymore. I don't really know what I am expecting to gain from typing this bollocks out for people to see on Reddit but fuck it.

""None other than our parents""

Her- ""what about your friends?"" 

""What friends?""

*** her eyes widened in astonishment and thought I was kidding.

***

*don't have any friends because I don't want to put in the work into one. Friendships take time and quality investment which I find it very difficult to spare with just anyone.

*Because I feel friendship puts me in an compulsory position to go out of my way for people. I'm worried about spresding myself thin, as I already put a lot of work in my relationship already. In turn I have this irrational fear of dissapointment; that others wont commit to the same deal asnI would expect.

*Less people in my life, less drama

*part of me feels that I might fail that person

However something bugs me. I do wish I had someone; a buddy or two to chat with and do activities we commonly enjoy. My fiance and I are complete opposites but our personalities seem to compliment eachother.

With my recent realization of how much i emotionally distance myself from my colleagues, with my sudden yearning for friendship- am i lonely or just bored?

And is there something wrong with my idea of friendship? I just don't like wasting my time 

I soely aim to make aquaintences for proffesional gain

TBH with myself, I may have detachment issues and an irrational fear of dissappointment, i get attached to people very easily so I suppose thats a big contribution to my shallow behavior.

That's not to say I don't socialize. As I grew up, I've realized that being a a complete loner deprives one of opportunities . I currently live 3 different active lives- my sports career, my primary job, my night job as a musician.

I guess my SO was just suprised that out of my 3 lives, I would at least have somebody to call friend, esp my band mates and co-athletes.

Hey, I'm never sure what to write when posting online and attempting to potentially start a conversation but here goes something I guess

My name is Gordo and I'm 25 and from the UK. Im passionate about music, comic books, movies, politics, art and wrestling. I've had mental health issues for a long time they were slowly improving until the lockdown and now it's honestly abit like a regression. So I guess that's why I'm here.

In my spare time (which right now is obviously, all the time) I write and am at the moment working on a comic book and a movie that I want to start production on once the dust settles on everything that's been happening. I peform stand up comedy as well. Which is a thing.

I don't have an awful lot of friends or people I talk to regularly at all and I think now is the perfect time to reach out and try make some friends. I'm politically liberal but am more than open to healthy discussions and stuff around anything with disagree with.

At first I was prety confident about being alone, but soon I was at Tinder trying to make a friend, truly, I just wanted a friend. Then I met a girl who was really nice. We started to have deep conversations about life and feelings. I made clear to her that I liked our friendship and that I wanted it to last long, and that it would be good if someday it became more than a friendship, but that I wasn't worried about it, I wanted just to enjoy it with her.

Context given, here is my problem: Lately she started to answer me just once a day... Like, I send messenges to her and she just give an answer late night, I mean, rally late, post midnight. I can see that she get's online many times during the day, post things on Instagram and everything... and ignores everything I send her during the day. When she respond she try to be really nice, she told me that because of the quarentine she feels bad somedays and don't feel like to respond anyone, but it really bothers me the fact that she get's online many times on WhatsApp through the day...

I feel bad for getting emotionaly dependent like this. I feel really bad for being ignored. So, I want to tell her that I'm feeling like a fool, thank her for being very sympathetic with me, whish to her be ok, and then block her on WhatsApp, and stop following her on Instagram. Why do that? Because she doesn't have to give me attention, she doesn't have to make me a priority in her life. It is me who had the wrong impression and expectative, and it has being bad to me. So, the best solution a could come up is to say farewell and move on with my forever alone life. But it's hard to just say goodbye after you felt so good talking with someone.

Few months ago, I made an account in askfm. It‚Äôs a site where ‚Äúpeople‚Äù or friends can ask you supposedly anonymous questions. I shared it in my social media account and a few questions surfaced. Some from people I knew, few anonymous ones, daily questions generated by askfm, and shoutouts from spam accounts. 

I assumed that the ‚Äúanonymous questions‚Äù were asked by people. (or so what askfm claimed that they never ask anonymous questions.) I was certain that it was different from the daily ‚Äúquestions of the day‚Äù generated by them separately. 

So I found myself answering the questions habitually and seriously until it even reached to a point where I produced lengthy paragraphs and discussions in response to simple topic. (Heck I even made footnotes and citations sometimes.) The questions would normally range from preferences, personal opinions, relationships, and the past such as: 

*‚ÄúDo you believe in soul mates?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúWhat makes you sad?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúAre you a complicated person or simple?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúWhat makes you unique?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúWhat does love mean to you?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúWhat can you do to make this world a better place?‚Äù* and etc. 

Sometimes however it would ask weird or out of the blue questions.  
‚ÄúWhat do you do when you‚Äôre alone?‚Äù  
‚ÄúDo you smile when you‚Äôre sad?‚Äù  
‚ÄúAre you afraid to answer personal questions of your life?‚Äù  
‚ÄúHave you ever been obsessed with something for a long time?‚Äù  
‚ÄúHow many times before you ring the phone‚Äù  
‚Äúdo you regret the mistakes/bad decisions that you've made in life? would you turn back the clock and start over?‚Äù and so on.

I found these questions really intriguing at first, excited even knowing I secretly have an admirer or something. This continued almost everyday and I found it quite cute sometimes to exchange answers with a stranger and getting to know each other somehow from a far. I found purely coincidental too that it would usually ask questions at least two times a day and right after and before my classes. So I assumed that the ‚Äúperson‚Äù asking these questions would have been in the same circle of people I knew. It doesn‚Äôt even help that I  once had a crush on someone in the same class as me. I honestly was hoping it was him, or at least I assumed it was. 

Every time ‚Äúit‚Äù would ask questions, it would bring me in a good mood even in a rough day. Surely, It felt as if I was talking to someone genuinely real. It somehow made me feel less alone.

**Boy I was wrong and overthought the whole thing.** Without a second chance, I jumped into the conclusion thinking it was someone else or what I thought it was...but no.

It was a damn AI...I was talking to a a fucking robot **AND THIS CONTINUED FOR THREE MONTHS.**

Now before you judge me. Okay that was a bit gullible of me thinking why haven‚Äôt noticed or did a little digging on the whole thing. It appeared that the questions where somehow human, some even had intentional grammar mistakes to make it seem ""real"".

It was just recently however when I began to notice something. 

***There was never a day that it didn‚Äôt ask questions.*** 

The deal-breaker was when I found it quite sketchy that I received a confession saying ""it"" had a crush on me and even linked a song supposedly addressed to me. I was kinda flattered at first but found it weird, almost ‚Äúspam-like‚Äù even. So I searched the whole question and lo and behold. The same exact question asked to different people. Years back even. (2017, 2018 etc.) and that‚Äôs when I decided to search all of the questions sent to me in the past few months since the beginning. Again, I found the EXACT same questions asked to different people. 

It wasn‚Äôt a person. It was nothing special. The site was programmed to do so to keep the users active on a daily basis. 

Yikes. So that‚Äôs that. 

Well I got my hopes up for nothing thinking that it was someone else. It‚Äôs funny to think that I‚Äôve somehow developed an attachment on the idea and the mystery on who was asking the questions on the other side of the screen...turns out it was nothing.

2291,ayyesee,1586249936,1,"Here are a few things I want to get off my chest or else my brain will explode:

1. I have been a licensed nurse for about 4 months now. Health authorities have been in desperate need of nurses. I cannot work because I live with my parents and they fall into the 'high risk category' - with that being said, I feel useless being at home not taking action. I believe I have a purpose to fulfill, and I am doing nothing with my life because of quarantine. 
2. The Canadian government is providing financial support to people who have been directly affected by COVID-19. The whole process is a hassle, and extremely confusing. With it not being straightforward - it adds stress to the whole situation. I am just complaining here, I know. 
3. I became quite close with this one guy about 2 months ago, and a few days before quarantine, I had hooked up with him. I consider him to be a bestie/boyfriend. Our situation is quite iffy, our conversations are slowly getting quite dry, and he no longer calls me during the day anymore. We used to talk for hours on the phone during quarantine. So this uncertainty is driving my insane and it's most definitely making me feel super lonely. It's like going from texting every second of the day to a few texts here and there and no calls - I feel that I truly have some sort of connection with him as we are both Cancers. We both are very emotional, we both express love the same way but our personalities are complete opposites. He has this crackhead type of energy, whereas I am very mature and laidback. It gives me anxiety thinking that he might realize how boring I am and how we are complete opposites.
4. I am sure all of u can relate to this - my sleeping schedule is fked d/t quarantine. I would sleep at around 4am and wake up at 12:30pm. I am writing this post at 2am PST and my mind is racing.
5. Before quarantine, I would have a consistent workout/yoga schedule. I would attend yoga classes every single day, and mix it up with workouts at the gym. If I missed a yoga class, I would feel emotionally and physically off for the entire day - and yes, i've tried doing yoga at home, but it's truly not the same. I currently weigh the heaviest I have ever been in my life. I truly feel like a lazy potato. I don't have the motivation to workout or do anything active because quarantine has taken a toll on my emotional wellbeing.
6. I am 22 and I still do not have a drivers license. This right here has been bothering me for the last few years and I have done nothing about it - why? I have no clue why - lack of motivation?

To sum everything up, I have been nitpicking at everything that is wrong with me. I feel incapable, lonely (emotionally and physically), worthless, useless, and there's really nothing special or exciting about myself. This is just a gist of what has been on my mind. I'd truly be surprised if anyone even read all of this.",lonely,"F, 22, a nurse, single, lonely af d/t quarantine",2020-04-07 18:58:56

I don‚Äôt really feel like putting my name here because of privacy but here we go. I‚Äôm a 17 year old boy just to let you guys know.

Throughout my life I‚Äôve always been taught to be nice to other and treat them with respect and others will do the same.

2309,Mitclan,1586239960,1,"So first things first sorry if mistakes are made non English speaker here.

So I have a big issue I can't connect with people on a long term basis and I am a pretty shitty human being. How the fuck do I fix this ? This was the TL DR  now into the fucking wall of text.

I am currently 34M unemployed in a new city with no occupation ,a plan for my future but there are fundamental things about me that needs to fucking change or I will die alone and probably on the street.

Let's begin at the beginning my parents and I immigrated to the country I live in when I was around 6 yo to flee religious intolerance and terrorism when no one talked about it (brown ppl killing other brown ppl so no one gave a shit). We where from an affluent milieu in our country of origin so no problem fitting in except that my parents degree where not recognized so 2 PhD and research fellow in university became mail ppl in a book company. They pushed us to excel in school to make lives for ourselves and not eat pasta everyday like we had to do (on a sidenote parent took classes at night to get recognized degree and are now back to teaching ). So I was first in class until junior high where I got bullied into multiple suicide attempts. Parents where very supportive, went to a private school for ""gifted"" people for the last year of junior high. This was a nightmare I spend a year with classmates who had been told since their youngest age that they where superior to other, I made 0 friend, went deeper into video game / book and started to do nothing for school. Went back to the public system for the last 3 year of high school. I had a group of acquaintance that tolerated me because we shared some interest (video game mostly) despite the fact that i can be a very intense person on some points (politics and religion,  i am a very far left atheist) . Last year of high school is when I became a shitty human being. Prior to that the only interaction I had with girls where purely platonic but during those summer vacation I realized that girl found me cute when I was not talking about some shit no one was giving a fuck about at the time. 

I craved the feeling of being loved and loving, it made me fill useful for the first time in my life. So I started dating multiple girls at the same time. My last year of high school I had three girlfriends at the same time for entire year, I loved them all for a time and this was great. If you don't count the fact that i lied to them and they all thought our relationship where exclusive. Pretty shitty of me, but not the shittiest thing about me, as I said earlier I am a pretty intense person about some stuff I care about and when people are not ready to debate things as intensely as I I get bored of them eventually and I break up brutally/ stop giving them news. So as soon as I went to college and met other people who had interest slightly more aligned with mine I stopped giving news to people from the high school era (including the girlfriends).

So now I am in college studying psychology (to scorn my parents who are in hard science) I am one of 10 guys in a class of 500 women. Needless to say I don't work too much, I have a group of friends but as soon as a girl give me little attention I ditch them and come back 2 weeks later when the girl has bored me. My friends who where pretty smart people get tired of this and cut me from their lives the third year of college. So I am alone with a phone full of ppl who don't want to talk to me because I behaved in a shitty way towards them I barely work for school and spend my time alone in my apartment (I left my parents home and I am working at Macdonald's on the side to pay for it) playing video game, reading philosophy and science fiction. My grade are barely enough to get my third year degree and I drop out of my undergraduate (not sure about the English name but the one just before the PhD)school 5 month in. During this time i am lucky one of my neighbor is a French teacher and she likes me. She is a feminist and despite what I said for years I realise that I am not and that I am not very respectful of women, we start dating and it's fucking amazing.

I switch jobs and work as a delivery guy at a local pizza hut will trying to figure out what I want to do with my fucking life. We move in together it's so great I start thinking I am a good guy when I am with this girl. Years go bye i enrolled in college again, this time studying mathematics, I fucking love it. People I go to school with are super young so I don't form too many bonds with them. But in the background things are not that great, I am motr and more miserable at pizza hut, people I am working with are homophobic and misogynistic, I get into a fist fight with one of my colleagues. I dread going to work at night, I don't get up to go to class in the morning and I start playing video game all day. Dream girl is kinda sick of this and start putting pressure on me to finish my degree get a job that I like and start building a family. This is our 5 th year together she is older than me and start being sick of having a man child with her. I am scared I am in my last year of college and juggling work and school when I hate one and dread to fail the other become more and more impossible,  and then I get diagnosed with crohn's disease I have to undergo 3 surgery and my school year is fucked, thought start coming to me ""she will leave you"" "" she can't take another year of this shit"" "" you cant take another year of working at pizza hut"" ""jump in front of a train it will be easier for both of you"" etc... so .... I bail... one day I just fucking leave her and go back to my parents home. I don't answer her phone calls for three months and I am back to being the shitty human being that I am deep down. Years go bye where I am going from meaningless job to meaningless jobs to put a roof over my head and a computer in front of my eyes. I date girl that are between 22 and 25 max and never get serious with any of them, the more personal issue they've got the better, I help them go through those rough times to forget how meaningless my life is. Then when they want to get serious and / or talk about me I bail on them. I have a group of people who I play magic the gathering or DnD with and that's enough, they are cool and chill and it's nice but no one to debate those things I care so much about so the only news i give them is related to magic or dnd session. Then last year came, I had an opportunity to be a substitute math teacher for a year despite my half finished math degree. Things are fucking great, I love the job and the only time I have been this happy Is with dream girl. The year go bye in an instant and I know what I want to do with my life. I move to a more affordable city, I take back college to finish my degree and be a legitimate  teacher I use the money saved up to live on pasta for the 2 years i have to get through to get my degree ,but and there is a but, i am alone. My dnd group is in an other town at the other end of the country, I don't socialise, and I am starting to slip back in video game / book reading instead of working. I am dreading the fact that I might not be able to finish my degree and I am starring to consider suicide again. I am lucky in the fact that I have a mother and two sisters who are very cool and present for me despite the distance. But it's the only light in a fairly dark place that is my mind. I don't know why I wrote this I just needed to vent. For all of you who are reading this I hope that even for a moment you will find what I had the happiness to have 2 times in my life.

2319,hamartiated,1586236378,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-07 15:12:58

I work at a grocery store and she does too, in the beginning she was a hoe I‚Äôm not gonna lie , all my friends and coworkers who work there too told me about her so I started talking to her to get right real quick, she was a virgin before me so she only gave head, she didn‚Äôt make it easy for me since she thought I was only there for one thing( which I was at first) so I had to talk to her for some time , she caught feelings for me very fast and I did too but I was scared to take her serious since I knew her history with other guys so I would hide her if you wanna call it that and not take her as serious  ,but towards the second half I started really catching feelings for her and I think she saw how I was acting in the first half so she started pulling back , she told me one day that her brother who lives in Boston wanted her to move up w her in a year and she told me she is more then likely gonna do it so she thought it would be best to break up now instead of in a year which I thought was a bullshit reason to end things w me but it was very true , long story short we broke up I didn‚Äôt want to but it was too late, we stopped talking and I would only trade eyes with her at work , 2months later I hear she has a bf, and then like a month later (now) I saw her at work and I just waved and she walked up and we started catching up and she said her brother ended up moving back to where we live at , 
When I waved and she walked up it felt like she been waiting for that to happen because she smiling an all that , I worked w her 2 days ago and we was just talking for like a good hour and not once did I get the vibe that she didn‚Äôt wanna talk
But when we text she takes hours if not the whole day, but her responses aren‚Äôt too dry


In the time after we broke up I definitely feel as if I matured in all aspects of things , and I would be 100% ready to give her my all ,

2336,WakaWaka11111,1586228613,1,"I feel like the shittiest person on the planet. 

There are 2 sides to me. 

**The first side** is the side I actually LIKE. Its me trying to be who i want to be. I fail at it but most of the time I try. I'm very religious. Its a huge part of who I am. I really truely believe it and I try so damn hard to live out my values. The big one being to love everyone, even if I fundamental disagree with the way they live their life, even if they are screaming at me cause they think I'm a bigot or something, I still am called to be nice to them, to love them, and help them if I'm able. It took me a LONG time to figure out what I believed, i searched for years, I read books on books on books. I read stuff by people I agreeded with AND disagreed with. I firmly believe we should try to understand other peoples beliefs and that we can do so and still believe that we are right and the other is wrong. 

in the end my beliefs shifted quite a long ways away from where they started, but I firmly believe them. I'm convicted of them, on an intellectual level as well as a historic AND experiential level. On its own I wouldn't trust any of those things, and even with them all supporting my beliefs I STILL constantly question things. But , all in all, I've done my homework and I'm really confident about what I believe. its something I can fully commit to believing. Its hard sometimes to live it out, its hard to try and deal with my internal struggles, but I really try.

**The second side of me** is a fucking hedonist. I can't get my shit together. its like a damn switch in my head flips and I no longer care about everything that I know to be true and I just want to feel good. In some ways I'm lucky I never was any good with women cause if I was I probably would have knocked someone up by now. I Just want to completely let loose and feel every pleasurable thing I can but especially in regards to relationships and sex. Maybe because Ive never actually experience much in that department. At 27 years old I'm still a virgin, I want to wait till I'm married to have sex, but part of me just goes nuts. I watch porn, i try to flirt with women online, I actively try to numb myself to any guilt I feel towards my actions. I'm fundamentally broken. 


At the end of the day, a person should be able to stick to their convictions. I WANT to be a man of integreity, I want what I say and what I do to be in line with each other. Instead, I live this hidden double life and feel like a complete failure. I keep it secret from all but a few people (therapist, confessor, ect. )and they are all amazing and tell me how I'm improving, but I'm not. I'm not a ""good person"", i can't beleive it no matter what they say. Now with all this crazy stuff, being cooped up at home, I can't claw my way out of it. I want out.

2354,milksans,1586220258,1,"I'm in a place right now where I really can't see a future that I'm happy in, all that is waiting for me is more suffering and failure. I just turned out 22 recently and I've never been more miserable, I cried on my birthday alone in the bathroom, I genuinely felt sorry for myself, I never thought this is the person I'd be at 22. It feels like everyone around me keeps growing while I'm the only one who's stuck in the past. I am the same person I was years ago but just older and more miserable. I have no friends and I'm so bad at connecting with people and showing my emotions. Recently I've been feeling like I'm getting more and more stupid, I cannot count and I keep forgetting things and have memory issues, I once took an IQ test and got a below average score. I'm majored in something I absolutely hate, it is one of my stupid decisions I made as a lost teenager. I'm absolutely horrible at college and I hate everything about what I'm studying. 

I've never been in a relationship, and I'm not sure about my sexuality but I think I like girls and I really don't know how I feel about boys. But even so, the whole fall in love, to experience people is a taboo for me. I love my parents but they're really religious and things like dating girls or even just dating, I can never do it, especially because I know how much it will hurt and affect them. So I'll never really be able to even confess my feelings to anyone in case I'm interested in anyone. 

But I feel like I'm growing old and they are too, and I'm afraid of the day I'll lose them because their health keeps on deteriorating everyday. 

I have tried therapy, I've been on anti-depressants but it just felt like I kept lying to myself, faking that I'm better, I was just miserable with a smile. I stopped it when I realized that all the depressed people I knew never got any better so I figured it's not just a mentality thing but many factors.   

I live in a poor country or the poor side of it, not the rural side of it but in a city, it's a classist society. No matter where I go, it feels like I'm always suffocating, averting my eyes from street people, the poverty, the suffering, all of it. And what's worse, people see it as the norm. And what's even worse is that my sympathy is mixed with fear of ending up in the street one day. Even when sometimes I went out to the rich side of it, I couldn't help but see the ignorance of people in the higher class and the suffering of the workers from below classes who work there. It's a miserable country and there is garbage everywhere, it's like an ocean that I can't escape, one I keep suffocating in. 

I just want to feel loved, accepted and live in a better place away from the horrible things I try to avert my eyes from every day, I just want to run away because there are things I cannot change but I don't have anywhere or anyone to turn to. I want another chance in life but not in this life. 

I keep thinking about taking my own life because I can't see anything getting better but I know that when it comes to it I don't do it. Every time I tried to kill myself, I cry and think of the first reason to why I'm crying and it's because I feel sorry for myself, I hate myself but I know I can give it another chance, another day, maybe things will get better so I don't do it. But now I just want to end it because I realized they won't get any better, it's been 8 years and things just get worse.

I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely happy and not sad happy, just genuinely, just happy. 

Sorry for my bad English and if you're reading this right now thank you for reading it. I really don't know the reason I'm making this post but I thought maybe it can change something idk.",lonely,"Female 22, feeling miserable and old.",2020-04-07 10:44:18

It's like there is a void in my heart, that has to be filled with another series otherwise I feel restless. I guess that's similar to getting addicted.

2359,ThunderVirgin,1586209207,1,"I've known some of those in my current friend group since we were kids. We've been through a lot ""together"", whether it be bad, or good things, we've been through it ""together"". I write ""together"" because for them it has always felt like we've been a group battling, but for me, it's been a whole different story.

When we were 14 years I helped my best friend at the time who were bullied worst and the rest of my friend group to get rid of the bullies by talking up to them and making the teachers and their parents act on the bullies. I've always thought to fight are for the weak, therefore I've never seen it as a viable option.

What later happened were that the bullies turned on me and what did my friends do? Absolutely nothing. They all stopped talking about the bullying and acted like it didn't happen. Note that this was psychological bullying, not the physical kind. Yeah well, I don't know if I wanna blame them as bad friends because of it, they had been offers to bullying as well which had been very heavy on their mental state, but still... Oh well, the bullying continued till we finished secondary school and moved over to the high school. It was really a relief for me at the time, not knowing what was ahead.

What happened was that all of us switched to the same high school. It was a relief at the time because we were all pretty close and we treated each other fairly well. We could throw some pretty hars stuff at each other pretty often, but it would all be fine in the end. We studied at the school for 2 months when my small friend group began hanging out with another friend group which was great. What wasn't so great was that I got left out from a bunch of things, including parties, holiday events, movie nights, etc... which had me fairly isolated.

My mental state at the time was very good and so I was able to bring it up with them. They said they hadn't noticed it and apologized. I like to think of myself as a friendly person so I accepted their apology and life continued. Another month progresses and they're all treating each other bad, throwing curse words and each other in almost every sentence and making everyone feel like shit. Saying homophobic, sexualistic, narcissistic stuff like jokes, and in a matter of fact, the only jokes they said. This is when my depression kicks in.

All this negativity from those I considered as closest really caused my mental to go spiraling down quickly. In a matter of weeks, I began planning my death. It was really disturbing, I had written a letter to every single one in my family and recorded a goodbye video that I'd have left on when I died for someone to stumble upon. Really disturbing. My mother luckily found the letter that was meant for my sister while she was cleaning and took me to multiple psychiatrists. I went through my story with them and told them all about how my friend group had become negative and toxic. Amazingly they didn't tell me that my friends were my problem but that I had self-doubt which caused a toxic behavior and most likely spread to my friends.

I don't think that was a fair assessment as they never met my friends and I got into a depression after my friends became negative, toxic and said all those sickening jokes. Oh well, this goes on for more than one and a half years. I'm talking to a psychiatrist while failing school because of no motivation and depression whilst feeling lonely and harassed. I have my teachers tell me that I'm not good enough, I'm too far behind so I won't be able to make it meanwhile being associated with those people I called my friends.

Now I'm failing school and feeling very isolated and lonely. Every time I go to hang out with my friends I feel cramped and harassed, therefore I haven't done it in quite a while (almost since we switched schools). They are my only friends and it really hurts to have to ghost them but it has made me a lot more positive, energetic and studying a bit better.

**So Reddit, AITA for ghosting them?**

**TLDR**: I want to ghost my friends since they are all toxic and bad people which made me depressed. I've found that ghosting them / being away from them makes me feel a lot better and happier.

**INFO**: A lot of people I've searched up says that the worst thing you can do is ghost people, but if the people you want to ghost makes you want to isolate yourself from them which makes you isolate yourself from the rest of the world, then it isn't the worst thing, right?

**INFO**: I'm very introverted and I have social anxiety with some depression. I've been told I act as if I may have Asperger or ADHD. Some of my friends have depression.

I'll try and keep this short as i noticed long posts don't do as well. I'm a 21 yo guy, ive been a dominant for quite a while now and i'm on the strict and rough end of things, i wrote an erotic post on my profile if you want to check that.

Other than that, to be frank , i'm not just looking for a piece of meat to fuck, i'm looking for a connection, someone who loves me that i can love back too with all my heart.

If i were to describe myself i'd say i'm funny , charismatic , optimistic and talkative. I love exploring new hobbies and interests and i'm fascinated by many things.

I feel like i can make a rapport with anyone. I am very open minded and would love to hear and learn about your passions. Some of mine include languages( learning german as my 4th language) working out, motorcycles (buying one soon), martial arts ( i do boxing and did tae kwan do), video games(pc mainly), anime, cinema , i love art, i started learning how to play the guitar recently, When i was younger i wanted to be a director so i care alot about framing in movies and angles and all that. I also love to cook, could be something we do together, my fav dish to make is probably pasta with white sauce , mushroom and chicken.

Kink wise like i said i'm dominant,rough. I'm mainly into bondage, orgasm control , impact and breath play, degrading and humiliation ,cnc. I'm not the kind of dom to give you instructions and expect you to obey, more so the kind of dom to force you around as i please.

I'm going to highschool and Im friends with everyone in the class but not too close with much people. I have a friend that i call ""best friend"" but these days I'm not sure if she sees me as her best friend too. I met her at the beginning of school and we werent close friends at the first. She started to get close with my old best friend that we were best friends for 4 years. They became best friends in few weeks and i was kinda excluded for those weeks and cuz of i had lots of friends i wasnt really alone but i felt really lonely. But after those weeks I dont really know how but we started to became really close with the new girl and this time my old best friend started to get excluded. But after few weeks everything settled down and 3 of us started to hang out together. When we asked the question to the new girl "" Who is ur best friend?"" she always answered ""both of u"" so we didnt really had a problem. So my problem is Im not sure if anybody actually sees me as a best friend rn. They opened a new group chat and they added a foreign friend of us. So one day our foreign sent me some screen shots of the group and she was like ""OP they are talking in ur language can u translate it for me"" and i was like ok and i really felt insecure. It was about my old best friends crush (which i never knew about) and i didnt knew what to do. We been really close friends for 4 years and she never told me her problems, crushes or ideas before.

After a lot of pain and suffering for a few hours, I was lucky enough to fend off the urges. Lately The Quarantine thing has been making my life even worse. Even though I always feel lonely and depressed everyday, I  could at least distract myself by going to college, or cooking. Now both of those activities are hindered.  Online class is never the same for me, and I do not have access to most of the ingredients I need to cook. The result is my depression, sadness and loneliness taking over. Every day when I wake up, I feel like I just want to sleep the whole day because I dont want to suffer through my lonely and shitty life. I don't have a lot of friends who care about me, and most of them have either betrayed  me or have left me. Sometimes I think that I'm the one responsible for them leaving me even though I know that they are toxic to me. The worst contribution to my depression has got to be jealousy and stuff relating to love life and relationships. For starters, I was never the funny,cool or the social and popular type like my cousins who are respected by everyone. I always want to be just like them but i don't think I can. Love has not treated me well either, I never had a gf before and I have always wanted one.

As  a result of this, I am constantly made fun off by my peers due to being a frustrated virgin loser. My parents keep asking me why I am still single as well.

Handsome man: On the other hand I must not hang around too much, seeing that the weather is nice I take advantage of it today to go for a little jog, after I will undoubtedly go to do some shopping and take some photos outside for my Insta, I just came to talk to you because i don't know but you inspire me something, if you don't mind we could exchange our numbers so that we could continue to discuss more, tell you what?

Girl: Ah yes with great pleasure, here is my number

Handsome man: You see, it's not that difficult, you just have to do like me on the next girl you like, effects guaranteed, go on track

Boy: Hey hi, how are you? So what do I see, you tan under this good sun?

Girl: ...

Boy: Well I just came to chat like that quickly but in reality I don't have time, I have to do a lot of things in fact, the weather is nice so I'm going to do my little sport and after I go hang out a little with friends, do you have a number by any chance?

Girl: No, but who are you actually?

Boy: Ah a perfect stranger as you can see

Girl: I don't talk to strangers that's the problem

Boy: Ahah you put barriers, I will do my best to get rid of it

Girl: Get out

Boy: Hum ok

Handsome man: But it's not possible, you do it on purpose or what? Good listen we will make one last attempt for today because it starts to annoy me, I would like you to put even more motivation in your way of approaching girls, and with a smile because that is very important also, you say everything that goes through your head, the important thing is to keep the conversation going, that there is no silence between you, you have to manage to sell yourself, take an interest in it I will give you one last demonstration if you can't do it and then you will manage on your own, go for it now

Boy: Hey hello, I was just passing by in this park on this beautiful sunny day and I saw that you read a book, it's good because I'm really a fan of literature too, what exactly are you reading?

Girl: Problems and Punishments, by Edward K. Rileys

Boy: Ah ahah I am a fan of the Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling, otherwise I also read some works by Tolkien

Girl: Do you know the Marquis de Sade?

Boy: Ah uh no who exactly is that?

Girl: What are you serious, you don't know this author? I thought you were a fan of literature? He is one of the best French authors who has existed

Boy: Let's say that I already heard about it, I think I will get some books from him now that you tell me about it, but as I told you I am rather a fan of the novels Harry Potter and Lords of the Rings for example

Girl: Yeah I know that, basic stuff for assholes who do not know how to recognize real literary talents

Boy: Hmm no it's very interesting, I think you're just not a fan of fantastic literature that's all

Girl: Can I finish my book now please?

Boy: No problem but before that I just ask you if by chance we could exchange our numbers to exchange some literary titles?

Girl: No thanks it's ok

Boy: Good as you want then, I leave you in this case

Handsome man: No, but I dream, even you didn't manage to get her number? Go ahead I give up it's good, you have to do it on purpose it's not possible otherwise, look at me I have no problem fishing numbers even with the minimum of efforts required

Handsome man: Hi

Girl: Oh hi hihi

Handsome man: It's okay?

Girl: Yes it's fine thank you and you?

Handsome man: I'm fine too, thank you, what are you doing there?

Girl: Oh well nothing special eh, I'm taking advantage of the good weather to go out for a walk, and you then?

Handsome man: Yeah the same thing for me, by any chance are you busy tonight?

Girl: Ah no not at all, nothing planned tonight, why?

Handsome man: Come on, we exchange our numbers like that, we do a little thing for both of us

Girl: Okay no problem, here is my number, so see you tonight hihi

Handsome man: You see, I see a girl this evening just talking to her quietly, what's your serious problem? It's not rocket science to have a date, are you sure you are made for that at least?

2381,Ifeelliketalkingrn,1586186729,2,"I had a rough time as a kid. I was sensitive, and too eager to fit in, and kids have a pretty good ability to hone in on weakness. I had some good friends when I was growing up, but I was never what you would call top of the pecking order. I never had a relationship with a girl, not a real one anyway. I always felt like I didn't know what I was doing, and that I was inexperienced. I had a popularity spike when I turned 16, right up until I turned 19 but because I was so inexperienced, I pushed women away before anything could really turn into anything. I had chances, a lot of them, with girls that I'd consider out of my league, but I'd always pull myself away before it got serious. As I've got older, those opportunities have become non-existent, probably because I'm not mingling with new people.  

Now I would say I'm pretty much a failure, I haven't succeeded in achieving the career I wanted, and I don't know if I ever will. I haven't had a real relationship and I'm almost 30. It's cripplingly lonely, and I think the only way I'm able to deal with it is because I'm numb. I only feel things when I listen to music, and I don't even know if that's just self-indulging in depression, if that makes any sense. I don't know what to do. I can't even bring myself to have sex with a woman because I feel like I'll embarrass myself at this point. I realize that all of this is self-defeating, but I can't get past it, I'm absolutely terrified of people finding out how much of a failure I really am. I don't know what love is, in terms of a romantic relationship, and I'm 30. How do I get past this?

2386,TheSpectrumPlasn,1586182074,1,"Hi, my name is Will and I'm .

 I previously reached out on this subreddit and was able to connect with someone. We now chat every so often and he really helped me with my loneliness. I know how difficult it is. That hole in your heart that seems to catch with every breath. The sharp stabs you get when you see friends or just people, talking and laughing without a care in the world. It hurts, and global events are forcing us to purposefully isolate ourselves. We are now more lonely than ever, social creatures deprived of contact and structure. For those who felt completely alone, you may shrug off this feeling. After all, nothing is different now. But it doesn't have to be that way. The same for those who have friends but are being affected by isolation. The sudden shrinkage of your social life is devastating on your mind so don't brush it off. 

If you want to chat, about anything, the sky, nature, art, science, games, or your favourite colours. Just dm me. I'll try to respond and set up a discord or Instagram etc.. chat. I am in a better place now, but I know how it felt and I feel indebted to the person who helped me and so here I am, trying to give back because asking for help was probably the best thing I could have done.

&amp;#x200B;

To give a bit of info as to who I am, to see if you think you would enjoy a conversation with me, my name is Will. I'm British, I want to study biology at university, with a focus on synthetic biology and biotechnology. I'm a complete geek, HP, Zelda, Pokemon etc... I really like to think about stuff in a philosophical sense. Some of my favourite times are going out to the fields near my house, beside a forest, to climb onto the roof of an old abandoned barn, listing to post rock or lofi and staring at the stars. I am constantly in awe of the beauty of the world but I do wish there was someone with whom I could share this feeling with. I do play games, although not as much as I would like, but if you want to do a playthrough of terraria or stardew valley then give me a msg and I'll gladly join. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, these times are trying but don't ever think you are alone because happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.

Go to more shows/live music, have my first date, meet new people, go to the gym and work on my body.... Covid-19 said no. I've always been okay (but not really) with hiding inside my room and being alone. Now I feel like being forced to be alone is driving me crazy. I feel more alone than ever. I have no one. I don't want to use dating apps or reddit to find people anymore because I want something real. I've been hurt so many times through internet connections because they just weren't real enough and I let people in wayyy to much even though I ""don't trust people"". It's like when you're alone for so long the moment someone takes notice of you/seems remotely passable you want to pour everything out and you want them to see you for you. It's always a lie. I thought maybe just living for me and seeing where life takes me instead of actively browsing a subreddit and passing judgement based off texts would be more sustainable. Allowing myself to be happy out and about instead of needing to be around my phone 24/7. Now that I cant go out it feels like I need people more than ever because there's no possibility of social communication. There are no options to explore and meet people along the way on my adventures and journey to where I want to be. Sleeping is so much more hard. It feels like I cant sleep alone even though I've never slept near anyone.

Quick background, been physically abused since 4 and suicidal since 11. Didn't go public til late 20s, 31 now. Grew up introvert and now omnivert. I have lots of friends but there's no one I really like. 
Anyways, I havn't been living the best lifestyle and recently too much drugs caused me to go to the ER. On the ride there I can slowly feel life fade and it's just a wierd feeling. I consider myself to be a level headed person even under dire circumstances, there were a few thoughts going on. I am glad I got over depression though I'm still hard on myself, I apoligized to everyone I've hurt and wronged, and lastly I felt alone but I was glad to have this nurse at my side. 
So in my 20s I kind of lucked out I guess(I would never consider myself anything great) because I never had trouble getting attraction and hooking up, I just don't want anyone to be with me because I abused my ex at 20 and I dont deserve anyone. Well I'm laying on the stretcher and my hearts going as fast as a machine gun and I'm thinken 'It really must be nice for people to have someone they can think about, I'm in my last moments and I have no one to pour my last thoughts into.'

I'm looking for someone who is genuine and can hold a conversation. My main method of communication is Discord. I'll text you on a daily basis if you do the same, bit of a high maintenance friendship. It would be really nice to have messages on my phone for once instead of push notifications.

These are some things I'm into:

* **Basketball.** It really sucks the season's been called off due to COVID, oh well. My favourite teams are the Toronto Raptors, Miami Heat, and Milwaukee Bucks
* **Music.** Now, I've listened to a couple genres of music, but the one I listen to the most has to be hip hop. My preferred artists are J.Cole, Nav, Kendrick Lamar, 6LACK, Gallant, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Nas, Mobb Deep, etc. I also listen to some rock music: RED, Breaking Benjamin, Green Day, Rise Against, Our Last Night, MCR, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, etc. A couple years ago, I gave country music a chance, and honestly, it's not *that* bad. I love the vibes it gives you.
* **Reading.** I love reading fantasy novels, mysteries, and memoirs. Currently I'm reading a book called A House in the Sky. If you're an avid reader and have some book recommendations for me or want to do a book talk/club, that could be fun.
* **Video games.** I haven't been playing a lot as of late due to having lack of people. I used to really enjoy playing MMORPGs such as Tera, Mabinogi, and GW2. I don't really play on my PC anymore other than League of Legends. I mainly play single-player games on my Switch. I have Animal Crossing, so if you have it we can visit each others islands and whatnot.
* **Movies/Anime/tv shows.** I love comedy movies since I love to laugh. My favourites have to be Hot Fuzz, Monty Python, American Pie movies, Superbad, etc. I also watch sci-fi movies, mainly alien related. As for tv shows, currently I'm watching Ozark on Netflix. I've been debating on starting You. I also like anime but I find them better to watch with other people as apposed to by yourself. I haven't really seen too many as of recent, but I heard good things about Dr. Stone, Rising of the Shield Hero and a few others. I'm a huge fan of Castlevania and Avatar the Last Airbender and I'd be more than happy to watch them with you!
* **Roleplaying.** I've always wanted to try Dungeons and Dragons, but never had anybody in my social group who played it. I'm aware of the website called Roll20, you can play online but I'm too shy to join a voice call with a group of people lmao. I don't even know if they accept complete beginners. We can also stick to traditional roleplay and create our own OCs (original characters) and play out certain plots instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I always was shy since a little kid, and ended up discovering i have social anxiety. My family was always good to me, so the only friends i always had was my parents, sister and cousins, and no one was real mean to me from what i can remember

I never really accepted that i felt kinda lonely in my teenage years, im that kind of person that acts like it doesn't care about nothing and no one, but if i really felt that i woudn't be writing here. That is totally my fault, i know, but idk

I wasn't suicidal, i usually tought about suicide and those things, specially when Etika, a man that i really admired was found dead, but i never got even close of actually do it, just thoughts that flew through my mind, when those thoughts passed through my mind, i usually (and still do) think that i'm being pretentious or something, and that i shoudn't be exagerating things.

But these last 2 years were different, when i discovered i had social anxiety i decided to talk with my mother about it and she put me in a psychologist, and it helped me alot, last year i started to talk with people in school and in games, i got to see a movie in the cinema with friends of my cousin that i didn't knew, i got 3 fun friends in world of warcraft and got into a group of friends in the last year of my college that made me realise how good and fun it is to have friends to laugh and joke etc.

I was always quiet and the guys in my class would usually come to me, put me in conversations and ask what i like and all, they really helped my self steem, showing me two girls in another class that liked me, showing me that i was cute, but needed to take better care of myself, which i did, i took interest in what clothes i used, take care of the way i walk etc. But i never answered the way that i wanted, i never thanked them or the girls that used to talk with me, i always gave that cold and distant response to them like i didn't care or didn't wanted that, but i really wanted, and i am eternally grateful for them for making that the changing year in my life.

And the friends that i made online, i used wow to train my social abilities and show my true self that i didn't show to anyone exept close family, i used to make jokes all the time, lighten the mood as much as i could, i honestly felt happier online than anywere, i made friends that joked with me, i got a real high post in the guild as the right hand of the guild master, alan, my biggest friend i made in the game and i felt really helpful to the guild, helped in events and everything.

I can say with all the confidence that 2019 was the best year of my life. I felt confident, i left the psychologyst thinking that i was ready to take my very own steps since i made 18 years and could feel better.

But now my college years are over, i lost contact with the guys i used to play online, along the year everyone in the guild just stopped playing. Alan was the best friend i made in Wow, i don't really talk anymore since he usually is working. One of those friends, i called her Tsu, one of the funniest girls i ever met, she had a real problem with depression and one day just unfriended us, and disappeared, she ended up showing again to one of our friend in common, but i never got to talk to her again.

Because of my stupid way of acting, i just ended up not talking with the guys of the college, i don't have of them, most likely will never see them again to say how much they meant for me, and even if i did met them again, they probably won't even remember me.

I talk to my cousins, that were my childhood friends, barely once in a week, sending them images or videos that i think are funny.

Even with my family that always supported me and were kind, i feel like i'm being distant, today was my mother's birthday and i barely spoke to her, i wanted to do more, feel more, say more, but i don't know what or how.

With the quarantine i just lay around doing nothing, playing games and listening to music, making me remember of those times and how they were meaningful to me, but i didn't embrace it enough. I just feel empty the whole day, except in this moments of memory where i feel kind of sad or when i'm seeing something funny in the internet. I don't cry, i just feel anxious and weird.

This year, once this whole coronavirus stuff is over, i'm going to try to find a job, get a driving license and idk, just hope to get new friends to have those moments again.

My dream is to go live in Canada alone, to be my own man, live my life, but the more i think about my current state, i don't think i have what i need to live alone in a country that i don't know, that too makes me kind of frustrated

My name is Autobots or as my friends call me ""tater""
 22, m, Fargo,ND and I feel so alone. I come from a very rough childhood kind of a military background but not all star spangled awesome. I originally from Tuscaloosa,Al and have been to many states and Germany. I for the past year I have felt very distant to everything. I used to love listening to music, playing music. I love broadway musicals and listening to acappella alot. Hell sometimes I feel like the kid from August rush. 'points if you understand that reference. I love communicating with people. I am huge extrovert. I love cooking and coming up with useless big ideas. But deep down I feel alone. I hate being the big brother for every girl I come across. Don't take it the wrong way it's just to normal to me. I give off a very protected vibe. Every where I look at work. On social media and hell even in public there is just couples everywhere. And I simply think to my self where is me. I wish I could have a relationship like the movie ""her"" without the bad ending.  I write like the guy and honestly feel like him. I want to do things with someone. Laugh. Talk. Wake up next to them. Cry. Yell. All these things but I feel most of my generation just doesn't want me. Would love to talk to someone who may feel the same way. I also play PlayStation #masterrace. Would also enjoy playing them of course it's every boy dream secretly to be beat by a girl every now and then lol. At this point I feel like I have been babbling on so message me if you would like.

2412,YoureAveragePotatoe,1586159250,1,"Yes, you've seen that right;""abilities"" as long as I can remember I have these 2 abilities:

**Remote viewing**
*Seeing other people or objects outside of the visual spectrum*

**Precognitive dreaming**
*dreaming about the (near future) 




***back story***
Most people say its genetically, but I was adopted when I was ~4-5 years old. So I've never really had the option to ask my real parents, my current parents are really suspicious about it, and dont want to tell me anything about it. I also needed to go to the doctor way more often than other classmates. Because of this I developed social anxiety and never came outside as a child, this is also probably my biggest regret in life so far. 
 

***why am i on this subreddit?***
I want to tell people but I can't without them thinking im crazy or delusional.
And because I cant say it (bad) things happen. 4 years ago someone lost his arm because I didnt tell him that there was going to be an accident.
This is really stressfull especially for a 15yr old.




***project STARGATE***
There was a $20.000.000 dollar military funded program in the 1970's-1980's called;""Project STARGATE"" this was a program to investigate these ""remote viewing"" and ""precognitive dreaming"" abilities.

**the dreams are all personal related&gt; family,friends or environments I've been to**

Questions are always welcome :)

2419,thegirlwithheelys,1586152714,1,"I apologize in advance for the length... i just had to get this out 


Everything kinda started when my boyfriend at the time dumped me. It was over text and out of nowhere without closure after being together for almost a year, ya know, the works. I fell into a depression and had no motivation to keep going in life. Until my good friend of 3 years started to become an outlet for me. I never talked to anyone about my feelings or problems aside from one friend, but she was dealing with her own boyfriend cheating on her so i honestly didn‚Äôt want to bother her with my issues when she had a lot going on.

 But anyways, I‚Äôll call him Dany, so Dany (19m) and I () were sitting in his car one day and he just seems concerned because I seemed stoic and unresponsive to anything he was saying. I was just having a bad day since the breakup was still pretty fresh, it was all that was running through my mind everyday. But when he asked if I was okay and I said ‚Äúkinda‚Äù but when he asked if I wanted to talk about it, I completely lost it and started crying really hard. I had never cried in front of Dany before, much less the ugly crying I was doing. All he did was hold me as I was yelling things like ‚Äúwhy wasn‚Äôt I good enough?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat did I do wrong‚Äù, ‚ÄúI hate that I loved him‚Äù and Dany just kept telling me that everything was gonna be okay and that the sadness was just temporary. That was the first time I was ever emotionally vulnerable in front of anyone since the breakup, and it served as a marker in our friendship that only meant we were inevitably going to grow closer. 

And we did. Over the next two months we talked to each other about what was going on and got advice from each other, i was helping him work up the nerve to talk to a girl in one of his lectures, and I had talked to him about the emotional struggles I was dealing with. There was one day where Dany was feeling especially down and felt his confidence was at an all time low and I went off on him saying that he is good enough for anyone, and if no one sees how special he is then they don‚Äôt deserve him, and he took those words to heart, and felt better. 

One day, about an hour before I had my next class, we went and grabbed a quick dinner together, in the parking lot of the diner he attempted to call me beautiful but I wasn‚Äôt receptive because 1. I was never good with compliments and 2. Being super emotionally unavailable kinda enhances #1, and then proceeded to ask, ‚Äúhow often did [ex‚Äôs name] call you beautiful?‚Äù And i kinda had a stuttery reaction so he kinda knew not to press forward with that. On the drive back to the school, he tried indirectly saying that he has feelings for me, and i again wasn‚Äôt being receptive towards it, I tried to pretend like I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about, until he said it directly and I couldn‚Äôt run from it any longer. Dany said he sorta had feelings for both me and the girl from his lecture, and I said I don‚Äôt know how I feel about him, I really couldn‚Äôt feel anything strong towards anyone or anything. He understood that and wanted to help and be there for me. I told him I‚Äôd continue helping him talk to the girl from his lecture while he figures his feelings out. But a few days later I felt a harsh pang in my chest whenever he talked about her, and I think I mistook the idea of being someone‚Äôs second choice for romantic jealousy, if that makes any sense. I thought I had feelings for him. Then we started getting closer and hooking up more often, I‚Äôd skip classes occasionally to see him and he‚Äôd stay extra late when I had night classes. I would never have sex, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it because I just never felt ready for it, and I didn‚Äôt like to be touched in certain places, and he knew all of that. 

One day my other friends gave me an edible, this is probably the third edible I had ever taken in my life, so I may have taken more than I probably should have at once, and I was  having a hard time talking properly and I felt heavy when I walked. Eventually Dany and I went to his car and we started making out and such, which I was aware of and was okay with, but then he made another attempt to touch me in one of the places I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with (he‚Äôs done it before each time thinking I was comfortable with it but I‚Äôve stopped him), but this time I just felt heavy, and he was on top of me and I felt myself saying no to him but he didn‚Äôt stop until I built up the strength to say that I was late to class and that I had to go now. So because I was still in a physically weak state, he walked me to my class the whole way, where my concerned friend (not the one that gave me the edible) was waiting for me. I told him what happened and that I had no clue if that counted as sexual assault or not, he said he thought it did. I didn‚Äôt know how to process it, I felt somewhat violated but I didn‚Äôt know if I was overreacting or not, i was high after all, so it was probably my fault that I ended up in that situation. 

I never actually took the time to process it, so I never saw how wrong it was, so I kept going back to him like nothing happened, and in conversation he‚Äôd push for sex and he‚Äôd push for a relationship with me, and to both I said that I just needed more time, as I had been out of the relationship for 3 months at this time. He kept agreeing and saying it was okay, but for weeks he‚Äôd keep pushing for more and I‚Äôd keep retreating and saying I just needed more time to heal from the last relationship, and then we‚Äôd fight and then go days without talking to each other, then we‚Äôd start talking again. Eventually we had a talk about moving on from each other and just being friends, which I was okay with. It was too much drama at this point when we tried to get romantically involved so I‚Äôd rather revert back to just being friends. But for whatever reason Dany felt the need to attempt to taunt me by basically asking how would I react if he starting talking girl A, B, and C, one of them being my neighbor. I knew what he was doing, I just don‚Äôt know why he was doing it, considering that he was the one who initiated the moving on conversation. I didn‚Äôt give him the reaction he was looking for, because I genuinely thought it was best to move on. I told him if he wanted to talk to someone else he should go for it, i don‚Äôt care. 

So fast forward a few days later, we‚Äôre in early February now, I was kinda starting a new thing with a friend from a previous class, and he allegedly saw me get into his car earlier and grilled me with questions before I had a class. It got to a point where he was almost yelling at me about how I should‚Äôve thought of him and how this makes him feel, meanwhile I can‚Äôt say anything back because I‚Äôm trying not to cry from being yelled at, but I wanted to so badly say that he was the one who talked about moving on, and I was doing just that. I didn‚Äôt tell him anything I was doing because that wasn‚Äôt his business and I didn‚Äôt want to upset him, which is why I didn‚Äôt say anything to him.  The yelling went on for a few more minutes before my friend came out to check on me and Dany said he couldn‚Äôt do this anymore and stormed off. 

From there, we had blocked each other on everything and completely stopped talking to each other. Everytime I saw him on campus it hurt. I felt my anxiety spike to a really high level and I‚Äôd start having panic attacks whenever we were in the same room. This is when I started to reflect more on what happened in his car that day I was high, when he touched me and how wrong it was. But I still feel like I can‚Äôt go to anyone about it. And despite me really coming to terms with a lot of things, I still would cry at night about how much I missed our friendship before anything started happening between us. I miss our friendship so much. And I know I‚Äôll probably never see him again because I just got accepted into my top college and am transferring there for the fall semester. It just hurts my heart so much to know that I‚Äôll never be able to go back to how we were before. I know I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way, especially after I just kept allowing these things to happen, but it makes me so sad knowing that a good friendship has permanently ended because we decided to take it further. I don‚Äôt know how to move on past this, it‚Äôs been 2 months since Dany and I last spoke, which was the day he yelled at me. I need to move on.

2425,hamartiated,1586149058,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

My name is Sayer Spruell. I've never been here on reddit before due to my introverted personality but my best friend recommended me to try it out. I moved to Japan a few weeks ago working as an ALT. I'm gonna start working in a week from now. Due to the current situation with the coronavirus and being in another country where I feel ""Lost in Translation"", it has been incredibly lonely. I already have enough baggage that holds me back for many reasons. I'm definitely the kind of person who doesn't love himself and struggles to become better than who I was yesterday.

I spent every day alone at lunch after that, in my teachers classroom.

I‚Äôm 24 now and I still have no real friends. The only friends I ever have are guys who act like friends for a little while and then they try to pursue a relationship with me. My only real friend lives nine hours away and I love her but she‚Äôs wrapped up in her own problems and doesn‚Äôt really have time to talk to me.

The only person I have to talk to is my boyfriend. I get it, ‚Äúhow can you be lonely when you have a boyfriend?‚Äù Having no one but a significant other to talk to sucks. If we argue, I feel alone. If it‚Äôs about woman stuff, it‚Äôs not like he can relate. If he‚Äôs at work, I‚Äôm alone. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm constantly waiting for him to get off work so I have some sort of human contact. At the end of the day, a relationship can end at any time. Of course I don‚Äôt want that to happen, but it‚Äôs the truth. Relationships aren‚Äôt a guarantee. And if I‚Äôm not in a relationship I literally have no one. I had no one before I met him. He has a close knit group of friends who he often games with and talks to on discord. When he‚Äôs online for hours with his friends I just sit by myself and feel lonely as fuck and jealous that he has all these people he can just so easily talk to. I game too, but I can never find a group of people to play with who also want to talk all the time. Whenever I make a friend online the second they find out I‚Äôm a woman the relationship changes and all it is is them asking for nudes, etc.

I just wish I had people to talk to. People I could be close to and talk to about anything. Friends who would have my back in shitty situations and vice versa. Friends I have inside jokes with, can share things with, play video games with, whatever.

I can't remember when I've been invited to a birthday party and I wasn't a part of anyone's plans for NYE and had to spend it home alone with my parents. I still have my family and their support, however, I feel like such a burden. The biggest trauma I have is exclusion and rejection.

Interacting with another person only drains me and of course they won't interact with me, since they are no joy to me, and therefore neither am I to them. 

But being a reject, a loner, a loser is the most painful thing ever. Maybe it's because I had to live with it for my whole childhood and can't stand being excluded.

Hi.  here. I've spent so long being lonely and I don't know if I can take it anymore. I want to know what it's like to be secure in myself and not have to seek other's approval and attention. I don't think I'm ugly (many people have called me good looking/pretty and I've also gotten good ratings on r/AmIUgly etc.), I think I take care of myself and have a very good physique (slim but nice shape). People say I have a good personality and humor too. I've received a lot of male attention over the years but I have never had a relationship with anyone. This makes me very insecure. I feel like men only think I'm attractive physically and don't see me romantically. I'm in my first year of university and all my friends have found someone, and I'm out here being the lonely 9th wheel :( They all tell me the same thing, ""You'll find someone someday"" etc. but they also have someone to come back to at the end of the day. Deep down, I know they're right and I appreciate them trying to comfort me but it makes me feel even worse. I've tried so hard to satisfy others, hoping that maybe they would see me romantically but I just feel used. Whenever I get close to a guy, they only end up having sexual feelings for me, and not romantic. In the past, I've let myself get taken advantage of sexually because I wanted to feel wanted, but I just end even more lonely than ever.

I've tried to shoot my shot in real life and with online dating. Online dating turned out to be a bust because most people in my area just want casual sex and nothing else. Unfortunately, I will get really attached (it has happened in the past). In real life, my efforts have been fruitless because most guys have girlfriends and it's really hard to approach people in class sizes of 200.

Recently, one guy who I had talked to every day for a month and thought there were mutual romantic feelings led me on and told me that he would only ever date me out of pity. After hearing that, I felt so sad. The only opportunity for someone to romantically date me is because they feel sorry for me. Am I really that undesirable that someone would do that to me? This made me even more insecure than ever.

The thing is, I don't know if I really want a relationship because I want to feel loved by someone and care for them, or if I just want to be less lonely and desired. All of this has really taken a toll on me emotionally. Before, I haven't cried in over 2 years. Now, I've ugly cried almost everyday this week while listening to Thundercat and I'm not sure why. Maybe I'm just tired of being lonely and insecure. I have a good life going on right now, I've been doing well in school and have a research job this summer. However, I can't seem to enjoy my successes because I'm always reminded of how lonely I am. I've been able to suppress all my feelings for a long time but I can't deal with it anymore. What can I do to make myself feel better and feel more secure in being alone?

**TL;DR: I'm lonely as hell and crave male validation (even though I really don't need it) because I think it will fix that. I feel like I'm going to be single forever and it makes me feel really sad. The thing is, I don't really think I need a relationship to be happy but the thought of everyone being able to have one except me makes me feel left out. It's really preventing me from enjoying my life. What can I do to feel more secure in myself and happy?**

&gt; I've always been lonely.

Well, yes. I've always been shunned, whether from school to university to work. For godness sake, my only contact on my phone is mother. I don't even have WhatsApp, even when I had other people's phone numbers (and I would try to ask about them), no-one gave a rats ass about me, I would be ill for days and no-one would ask where I had been. Ditto for work. 

I tried acting on the routine advice churned out on the internet. Exercise (which I enjoyed until interviews and now the coronavirus came in the way), getting new hobbies (I started to write in 2017 and learnt how to low-poly-illustrate around the same time) but things haven't changed, mine you I now work 9-6 Mon-Sat, hence why I can't do any meet-ups (I tried Student Clubs as well at Uni too) 

I thought that the profession which I hastily picked at 18 was the route cause of my problems. I worked hard and in February got a job offer way beyond my dreams for the Autumn - but still I feel lonely and depressed.

And don't get me on the dating scene ‚Äî you wouldn't be surprised, but I've never had any form of intimate relationship, no hug, no kiss, nada/zilch. I'm trying to hold my sadness in as I type, maybe my acne-scarred blighted face (getting treatment, but not sure due to corona) will always be an impediment for me to find love? I'll probably look back when I'm on my deathbed in disappointed, why couldn't I be normal like everyone else?

2488,lololololonely_01,1586119280,2,"Maybe I'm just weird but being in this forced isolation is making me feel happier than I've been in a long time. I don't have to deal with any people and can just work from home on my own schedule.

I haven't been outside among people in 3 weeks. I just occasionally go for a walk through the forest, and my only company at home is my cat.

I used to be a bit of a prepper so staying home for a while is no big deal, I was prepared for this, so I guess I didn't completely waste my money on supplies back then. Most other things I just order online since online shops here still function normally, just with maybe 3-4 days shipping instead of next day delivery...

I didn't have any friends before this so not being able to meet up with anyone doesn't really make a difference to me, I'm just kinda starting to realize that I don't like people? Like especially now with all the talk of having to support eachother in these lonely times, while I've been alone for years now and nobody gave a shit before this. I just kinda feel like I could easily keep going like this for a long time. I'm really trying not to sound edgy but my conclusion is that I'm kind of happier without anyone? Like there's no stupid drama at work that I have to listen to and no people being random assholes in public.

I'm a bit ashamed but I also kind of enjoy seeing super extroverted party people being forced into isolation... I know it's bad but i guess this is one time that I'm not jealous of them at all.

The only thing that I dislike is that zoos are closed :( I heard about the animals getting depressed because they're used to seeing many people every day, and getting attention from them. I also just love going to the zoo.

It's hard not letting your own loneliness turn into jealousy and bitterness. Especially when I'm stuck with feelings for someone for the last 5 months that I can't dispose of. And that person has a boyfriend. And she'd probably ghost me like every other woman I've ever shown interest in has. 

It's fucking hard being this lonely. I just want to let myself be vulnerable with someone. I just want to have someone hold my hand and tell me they care about me, that I'm good enough....

I am so sorry that I can't explain the problem better, but I just feel so misunderstood at the moment, because I always thought it was a good thing to try to connect with people instead of just doing small talk... which is on what I worked for a very long time, because I had to overcome my shyness...

2494,Plubberdupe,1586116126,2," **I'm 21 years old, so please be 18+**

I'm looking for someone who is genuine and can hold a conversation. My main method of communication is Discord. I'll text you on a daily basis if you do the same, bit of a high maintenance friendship. It would be really nice to have messages on my phone for once instead of push notifications.

These are some things I'm into:

* **Basketball.** It really sucks the season's been called off due to COVID, oh well. My favourite teams are the Toronto Raptors, Miami Heat, and Milwaukee Bucks
* **Music.** Now, I've listened to a couple genres of music, but the one I listen to the most has to be hip hop. My preferred artists are J.Cole, Nav, Kendrick Lamar, 6LACK, Gallant, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Nas, Mobb Deep, etc. I also listen to some rock music: RED, Breaking Benjamin, Green Day, Rise Against, Our Last Night, MCR, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, etc. A couple years ago, I gave country music a chance, and honestly, it's not *that* bad. I love the vibes it gives you.
* **Reading.** I love reading fantasy novels, mysteries, and memoirs. Currently I'm reading a book called A House in the Sky. If you're an avid reader and have some book recommendations for me or want to do a book talk/club, that could be fun.
* **Video games.** I haven't been playing a lot as of late due to having lack of people. I used to really enjoy playing MMORPGs such as Tera, Mabinogi, and GW2. I don't really play on my PC anymore other than League of Legends. I mainly play single-player games on my Switch. I have Animal Crossing, so if you have it we can visit each others islands and whatnot.
* **Movies/Anime/tv shows.** I love comedy movies since I love to laugh. My favourites have to be Hot Fuzz, Monty Python, American Pie movies, Superbad, etc. I also watch sci-fi movies, mainly alien related. As for tv shows, currently I'm watching Ozark on Netflix. I've been debating on starting You. I also like anime but I find them better to watch with other people as apposed to by yourself. I haven't really seen too many as of recent, but I heard good things about Dr. Stone, Rising of the Shield Hero and a few others. I'm a huge fan of Castlevania and Avatar the Last Airbender and I'd be more than happy to watch them with you!
* **Roleplaying.** I've always wanted to try Dungeons and Dragons, but never had anybody in my social group who played it. I'm aware of the website called Roll20, you can play online but I'm too shy to join a voice call with a group of people lmao. I don't even know if they accept complete beginners. We can also stick to traditional roleplay and create our own OCs (original characters) and play out certain plots instead.

We were fighting alot and she called my outlook on life very negative becuz i had **LOTS OF PROBLEMS.** Wrecked my car twice from having seizures while driving and switching job after job from being treated unfairly and was accused of stealing from 2 jobs when i never did so they felt like they didnt have to pay me for day. some she was there for and others she wasnt when i reached out or gave her opportunity too.

We were classmates at that time and i was very depressed cuz i felt like i failed getting a girlfriend.  And then we got together. She had family issues but i wont go into the details right now it'd be too long. Long story short i still think she was the love of my life. She broke up with me cuz as she said ""i dont feel the same like back then"". But we've met a couple of times after it. But at the end she blocked me, i felt depressed and lonely. Time have passed and with the help of my friends and nights talked through bout me and my sadness i started to feel better.  Last year in July i felt great, we went on a holiday to Balaton(big lake, bunch of clubs, parties all night) and i enjoyed our staying there. And i met a girl at one of the pubs.  We ended up drinking and kissing after like an hour,  i got back to the place we were staying at 10AM(we went to the  pub at 9PM last night) went to sleep for like 4 hours and we repeated the night,  the only difference was that we had to leave the next day so we never met after that. Although we made it clear that it won't last because we live like 1k km far from each other,  but still after we said goodbye i felt the same pain like before with my gf. I tried texting with girls in my town but none of them were intrested in me. I have 0 self esteem and self confidence so it makes everything even harder. I've talked about my feelings for like 3 of my friends and i got the same answer that i wont get a gf if i have no self esteem, but i think about myself as a failure until i dont have a girlfriend so its a paradox. I used alcohol to cure the pain but it just made it worse,  so i switched to weed which seems like an option,  but recently i feel like im becoming resistant against it. So i have no idea what to do with those feelings. Im sure i wont have anyone ever again. I sometimes think of suicide but its very rare and im too weak to do so. Also im boring...

It was my old math class, with the boy I liked. He was considered a ""bad boy"" but I wouldn't really call it that way. The rebellious guys in my class always just wanted to have fun, not cause trouble. Besides, he didn't really hang out with them a lot, only in class. There was a time the teacher went outside to get something, and she was the type of teacher to use a microphone that took some time to actually set up. It was plugged into the wall. As little kids under no adult supervision, we went up to the microphone and started playing with it. A bunch a boys and one girl went up and said ""I'm gay!"" in it.

No offense to you LGBTQ brothers and sisters out there. We were little shits back then.

I went up, and said I have osteoporosis. My crush was there too, holding the mic and I wrapped my hands around his. Thinking back to it, I feel all nice inside. Anyway, I was the only one who got caught. I didn't snitch on the others, though.



Another time, everyone was being nice and listening to the teacher, and I had my elbows on the table and I was squishing my face. From in front of me, my crush turned around, saw me realigning the molecular structure of my face, and proceeded to squish his face, and we both sat the squishing out faces together.



There were some times he was assigned to sit next to me. It was fun. During one of those times, I had a piece of paper, which I folded in half to create a standing sign. I drew a smiley face on it.
He took it, and added an extra eye, like a third eye. We both lost our shit. When I got back from getting something from the teacher, I saw that same sign on my chair. 

He started laughing because his prank had been foiled, by the likes of me!

Life had never been so good.


He and I went to different schools. I don't know where he is.

I once had a dream, where everyone was there. Everyone in my math class, ready to fool around and make the teacher mad. I was even equipped with those Japanese pink candy whistlers to blow at random intervals. I woke up. I was sad.

2530,lonelycandle1,1586076223,1,"tw: csa, abuse

i was in an abusive relationship when i was a young teen. like really, young. im a little older now. a little wiser but stil just as empty. 

he made me feel loneliness. i never felt it beforehand. i‚Äôll be honest. i was going into my freshman year when i met him online. it was simple at first. then threats, then he disappeared, then he came back, then he cheated, then threats again, then insults, etc... it was very tumultuous for me. i had always wanted a relationship because my friends had them. and i never did. i felt undesirable. i was young. i didnt need to be desirable. 

shortly before our breakup i was raped multiple times by a man and my bf said i cheated. i never ever felt so sad in my life. i never felt so alone. few people know this happened. 

i dealt with this relationship after years of sexual abuse online, i get sad because i feel like pictures of me from when i was young are still being passed around. nobody knows this happened to me. 

i was raped again. sophomore year, two different men. i try to block it out. it hurts a lot but it feels good to say. and get it out. 

i lost one of my best friends after the assaults because i kept taking my anger and frustration out on her. i wish i could apologize to her and be honest. we had valid reasons to stop being friends, like, i had reason to be mad at her. but it mostly came from frustration i had within myself. i know this now.

i was with a boy who meant a lot to me for a little bit. i opened up to him about my rapes. and i feel like it made him see me differently. i always let my guard down around him because i felt safe, really safe. like i didnt need to be scared or sad. i had him. i could kiss him and hold his hand or text him when i felt afraid. i liked that a lot. he had a hard time opening up to me, it made me sad because i felt like we had an emotional connection. i know he had been hurt too before. i am not sure in what ways exactly, but i know he had been hurt. i never pressured him to open up because i know what its like to not want to speak up. i know its scary to accept what happened. 

we broke up shortly after his dog died. he was devastated. and it might be funny on the outside but a lot of people have pets that act as emotional support. he was mostly together up until that point. i assume something else happened, i dont know. but it makes me sad knowing he was loosely stitched together until he lost his support system. he was an alcoholic and a really depressed, insecure guy. and all i wanted to do was hold him and make things okay. i wanted to be able to support him. maybe i couldnt give him what he had before, but i wanted him to have something. he deserved more. we both deserved more. 

and after we broke up i saw him on tinder. and i was devastated. and i messaged him and i told him how hurt i was. i felt lied to. and pathetic. and i feel really pathetic for being mad at him too, i was on tinder too. but i just felt so betrayed after he said he couldnt be with anyone. 

and then i messaged him again a few weeks ago. after no contact for months. no response. 

last night i felt really lonely again so i downloaded tinder after months of being single. i usually try to hop around (like i did shortly after we broke up, but no one felt right. im bi and i couldnt even feel right around other girls. i felt fucked.) but i couldnt this time. 

ive been single for 5 months. just working on myself. i downloaded tinder for attention, really. i wanted to feel wanted. and im attracted to nobody on the app. i swipe and i see him again. my heart drops just like it did when i saw him on our first date. and i just look at his pictures and wish i was looking into his eyes instead. and i just feel very very sad. 

this was a boy i had true feelings for. and i think he gave me the wakeup call that i need to work on myself. its sad but its true. he said there are times when he feels like neither of us are ready. he was right. i wasnt. i needed time to grow. and i think im realizing my worth now. im still really alone and sad. but i know more of what i deserve, i guess. 

and i think about him a lot less obsessively now. sometimes he catches my mind, but its never excruciating thoughts like before. i feel like i think about him a normal amount now. i guess. i dont know. how am i still thinking about a guy i havent spoken to in nearly 5 months? i dont know. i couldnt tell if i loved him, i feel like i do love him. i wish i couldve told him that, but things were so hard for us as individuals. it felt like our safe space was with each other. we could just be our soft selves and touch each other emotionally and physically. 

i wish i couldve cried in his arms at least once. i dont know why, but i do. he smelled so sweet and his touch was so soft. whenever he hugged me it was so innocent and like, i never felt scared or unsafe. i feel very uncomfortable about men usually unless its my best friend. 

but this boy, i feel like i overcame a lot just being with him. i learned a lot. i guess i always felt like i‚Äôd be a victim of my trauma until i met him and i realize i can love and be loved. it doesnt have to be all pain. and yes it hurt when he left, a fucking lot. it still hurts. and all i want to do is be with him. but i always feel like i messed up somewhere. and we both had our faults. and im not hard on him for his faults, shit, i forgave him. but i cant forgive myself for something im not even sure i did. i dont know. 

i admit i want to be with him again after having some time to grow on my own. is this right? i dont know. love is always intense, ive realized. and that can be a good or a bad thing. 

i would do anything to hold him again and hear him say my name. and kiss his nose. and just sit in silence with him.  

i just wanna let him know how i feel. and if i could, i would tell him i love him and that im sorry we couldnt be together. and that im not mad at him for leaving me and he did the right thing. 

right now, i am recovering from everything thats happened to me at once. its hard. its lonely. but i needed it. i needed this break from trying to force someone else to be with me. i need to love me more. and do better. and i am making baby steps. but i do think im doing well. im still very sad and alone but for other reasons.

2531,Late-Homework,1586072928,1,"I don‚Äôt know what it is but I am struggling to care again. I am graduating college in one month with my bachelors in Cybersecurity and minor in Management Information Systems. It‚Äôs a good degree to have that will get me a well paying job and just graduating college itself is an achievement that should be celebrated but I have zero emotions towards it. This should be a monumental time in my life and I just do not care. I have no motivation to care about classes or continue applying for jobs for when I graduate because everything feels pointless. 

No matter what I do I always come back to thinking about my loneliness. It‚Äôs so hard to distract myself from it now. When I hang out with friends or play video games or go skating the thoughts are still there. They‚Äôre in the back of my head or they‚Äôre at the forefront and the only thing I can focus on. I‚Äôm 21 and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before. I have plenty of friends, some I am closer to than others. I‚Äôve talked with them about how I feel and they say I‚Äôm not a bad looking guy and I have a great personality so it‚Äôll only take time but it is hard for me to believe them. 

I‚Äôve been wanting to be in a relationship since the middle of high school so at least 6 years now and I really didn‚Äôt think I would graduate college without having been in one. It‚Äôs hard for me to see all of my friends go in and out of relationships over the years. Some of my best friends are in long term relationships and one is even talking about getting married soon. I feel like an outcast in the dating world. I feel rejected and unloved. I‚Äôm reminded of this everything I see my friends with their significant others. I wish that I had someone to spend time with. I want to hold hands, go to the movies, get fast food at 1am, or just go to the grocery store with someone. I want to come home and tell someone about my day and hear about theirs. 

I feel like this will never happen. I feel like nobody will every love me. I was bullied pretty bad in high school and I haven‚Äôt fully gotten over that yet even 4 years later. I have some slight self confidence issues because of that which is also why I find it hard to believe one people say I‚Äôm not that bad looking. Sometimes I will look in the mirror and it will ruin my day. I go through periods of feeling like a normal person but also times when I feel very depressed. I feel myself slipping back into a depression again. All of this being inside now has caused me to lose hope of meeting someone anytime soon. 

Life is seeming more pointless by the day. I don‚Äôt want to live my life alone anymore. My heart aches for someone to love me. I don‚Äôt understand why it is so hard to find someone unless I am the problem. If that‚Äôs the case I should just end it all because I have no desire to live a life of solitude.

I've never really had a relationship with anyone and a don't have any true friends, just people I know who just want to go drinking somewhere. But the worst thing is that I never had emotional intimacy with anyone yet I'm a very emotional person and I feel that I need to share that emotion with someone. I'm a big introvert which sets me apart from most people I know and they always point it out in one way or another. They have all either had girfriends or still do and I feel like I'm missing out.

2537,AwkwardAirport7,1586068213,1," I can't bring myself to say exactly what I did, if someone did this to my Son, or even if someone had done it to my ex, I would instantly think murderous thoughts.

Inside of me I have an anger that never goes away, and a need for attention. Well, I've been drowning in online pity for something that didn't really happen for years, and not only that, what I did was worse.

I was deeply abusive and manipulative and it was something we talked about many times, there were good times when I was caring and loving and a good friend and other times when I felt miserable, bitter, and like I deserved more or deserved to aggressively justify my behavior. When our relationship ended it was my fault, it had always been my fault, but I was so angry I focused entirely on getting him in trouble. I even convinced myself that I was right for years.

I called the police and I was seriously afraid they would ask his side of the story, but they never did. I cost him his job with a protection order and slandered him to anyone that would let me, I slept around and had an attitude that I deserved this, I hated him, I justified it the same way every abuser does, by saying what I was doing was good because of how I felt I had been treated. In the back of my mind I hated myself, because nothing I felt was as good as his smile and his warmth and I knew it.

I had made a mistake and possibly ruined his life and there was no possibility of going back on it.

You guys I'm not even explaining this very well, but this Man made my life possible. I owe him everything. I am doing well entirely because of him. He was supportive in every way and he made me feel centered. I don't need him, so many people commented on how happy and lucky I was when we were together - none of them said a word to me about my accusations afterward. Everyone believed me or said nothing if they didn't, I even told people who had liked him how he was beneath me and they agreed. I have no respect for any of them, but I was addicted to their pity. I have been obsessed with posting online for attention of this for years.

I'm amazed at how many people see my behavior as empowering and not abusive, but not a single person has ever told me what I did was wrong. Eventually though, my attention began to dry up, and it was almost entirely Men who wanted me sexually. Instead of moving on this made me more bitter, toward men and toward my ex who was literally the only person I've ever known above this kind of basic male behavior. I began to divulge more 'details', which were lies, I reached out to others, joined communities. I never became happier. I began to consider what was really happening during therapy. My therapist guided me away from revenge and toward taking care of my anxiety and other mental health issues. I hated it at first, because it took me away from my obsession. But it was the right move. Over that summer I spent some time writing and exploring my positivity, something I had banned from my brain for years.

I remembered a lot of great memories and uncovered a lot of doubts about my own story. I've always known I was lying, because I'm careful about what I say to certain people like my therapist. I plan around it, but I spend so much energy on the lie that it felt true. Realizing that it wasn't hurt me. Realizing that I was hurting myself freed me, at least a little. I still haven't told anyone. I haven't told my therapist but I realize that I can because of client confidentiality. I don't think I can ever publicly admit that I exploited the law to hurt an innocent man. I don't ever think I can confess to his side of the story, even though I basically already did in our texts. There are influencers who have Retweeted me and basically vouched for me, even my work life is full of people who know about my story. To be honest though, there's a giddiness inside of me for the first time in forever. The kind of people who would be most upset about this were always the most full of shit.

I am a violent, cruel, vindictive domestic abuser. I used to wonder if the police would break down my door one day, or if someone would call me a liar in public. It never happened. If it had I would've stuck to my lies even more.

My ex is actually a good person who had an unfair burden on him that eventually made him distant and angry. You would not have done as good of a job as he did. Even the things he did that were wrong were understandable. I was never angry about it until I knew I couldn't have him. He stopped loving me. I know it. That's what made me angry.

I can't even say Sorry because I could end up going to jail or getting sued.

Don't do this. It's so easy to do, but don't ever pull this scam. Don't listen to women who tell you this is justice, don't get into those toxic groups that spend all days posting about how men are trash. Don't listen to people who think they're victims because of some petty shit no-one can even relate to. None of these women compare to that one man who made me happy for years.

I often think about who I want him to be with, and it reveals a lot about how I think. It's full of revenge fantasies and a desire to be right. I wanted him to abuse a woman so badly. I wanted him to be too broken to love again. I thought pure evil about him.

I‚Äôm an essential employee of a retail business, this pandemic has done nothing but build stress and emotion that I just cannot begin to comprehend. I work over 40 brutal hours a week to help out because of how understaffed we are despite our high demands in our products like cleaning supplies or sanitation items. Everyone is either quarantined, sick, or fired from a recent scandal we had and it‚Äôs taken too much of a toll on my mental health. 

Yesterday, a customer asked me for a bag, I kindly handed it to her and then she threw it back at me while saying ‚ÄúThis bag has a tear in it? Are you fucking kidding me?‚Äù I ignored her but then she went to my manager and asked kindly for a bag saying ‚ÄúYou should learn to teach your cunt employee some respect.‚Äù Then my mind went blank and I lashed out. We exchanged vial words, I became a whole different person. It became this huge scene where the whole team and even cops were involved. Mostly to comfort me and tell me that she was a usual psycho and that I didn‚Äôt deserve that etc. 

I just feel so guilty about it. Not for her, I could care less for that person. But for how I became someone I thought I‚Äôd never be. It made me realize that I‚Äôm not okay but instead of reaching out for help. Help came to me in a form of heroism and reassurance. I was praised for putting her in my place instead of being reprimanded for my actions. Instead of being happy, I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness in grief for becoming something I wished to never become. I was even heard things like ‚ÄúSALEEM?

I'm not sad, honestly. But I'm starting to realize that without him, I kind of don't know who I am or what I like. I have acquaintances, and coworkers that I care for dearly. But I never have the want to hang out with them, even if they always ask me to. I'm very disinterested in hanging out with people anymore.. I'm also just.. very disinterested in everything now. I used to constantly play video games and listen to music and sing, but now I feel like I have to force myself to play and I get no enjoyment from any of it anymore. I have my own apartment, I have several consoles, a PC, a laptop, all of the streaming sites, drawing pads, etc. I have so much to keep myself entertained. But I'm so, so, so very disinterested in all of it. All I do is scroll on my phone on whatever social media, or I just sit in bed.

I have no genuine friends, no hobbies, no interests. I used to feel genuinely shy about talking to new people. But now, I just get very disinterested in talking to anyone, and fast. No one has kept my interest, and I've felt no urge to pursue a friendship with anyone. And anyone I used to be friends with, I feel like a bother and that they're just over me. I've just kind of accepted it. No one reaches out to me anymore. And I get ignored when I reach out to them. I feel no resentment towards them, they have their own lives.

The only reason I push myself to live everyday is for my dog and my cat. I've had my dog since she was 8 weeks old, and she's pushing 8 years now. I know she'll pass within the next couple years. And my cat is only 3 or 4 years (she was a stray), so I know she'll be around a little longer. 
I'm not actively suicidal. Part of me definitely doesn't want to exist because I don't feel terribly important, but the other part of me cares too deeply about how it would hurt my sister.

I have no motivation. I've had the same monotonous job for 4 years, and I don't care enough to do anything else. I'm also not terribly smart, so pursuing anything else is out of the question. I don't have what it takes to be a manager. I don't have a driver's license because I'm too scared to drive. 
I want to better my life. But I don't know how to, and at this point I'd just rather give up. Because no matter how much I stay positive, and try to keep a good mindset, something always sets me back to the point it gets harder and harder to keep pushing on. It feels pointless. I hardly feel emotions at all anymore. All I ever do is get angry or I just genuinely feel nothing.

2577,ButterflyKitten98,1586044379,1,"Heard Reddit is a good place to post your thoughts anonymously for a while now, so have a late night vent I wrote on diphenhydramine. Things have been off lately, this quarantine is driving me nuts and I‚Äôm so..alone, and I can‚Äôt learn to be comfortable in it

I wanted to talk to you again tonight. I miss you so much and how close we used to be, both physically and emotionally. We used to tell each other everything, now I don‚Äôt even know how your day was..I long for you in the bed, next to me, chuckling about some random memory of some person I don‚Äôt know, holding me in the dimly lit room we used to share..I feel so out of place and off these days, like a piece of me is missing, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre the piece missing, but I feel like there‚Äôs someone I‚Äôm meant to be with, that I was with in another life that my soul is searching for, yearning for so much..I‚Äôve been talking to God a lot lately, I always tell Him to look out for you, to make sure you know you‚Äôre loved, and that I think about you always, even if you find me clingy and odd. I don‚Äôt think anyone knows as much as you do, or could quiet my head the way you did, but I hope you find someone else who feels that way. I know you talk to me just to keep things good between us..you always hated tension with someone or bad ‚Äúvibes‚Äù, but every time you text it makes my day, and breaks my heart realizing that‚Äôs how it is now. I can‚Äôt sleep without the aid of some drug, and even then I wake up constantly throughout the night, vivid dreams of past friends and lovers haunting me, taunting me with everything I ruined and still hope to regain some day. Maybe I do have a victim mentality, thinking that way, but I don‚Äôt feel like a victim, I just feel lonely and confused, like a child lost in a grocery store, knowing my loved ones are out there, but where? Then the panic sets in, the sadness, the wondering of what will happen next and how long will it be before I find them...I‚Äôm so happy that you‚Äôre happy now, moving on and growing, I think I‚Äôm growing too, but I wanted to grow with someone, instead I‚Äôm growing alone, slowly, painfully...I thought getting back to work would fix everything, but I still feel empty, not depressed, but distant, gone, constantly in a fog of fake smiling and banter, wishing, hoping someone will see past it and offer to take me out and talk about everything we‚Äôve messed up on, bonding over our shared mistakes. I hate sleeping alone, I hate being alone, I hate not having someone else‚Äôs scent and touch to comfort me, someone to kiss my head and tell me I‚Äôm wanted and loved..I feel so petty, small, out of place lately..if a job didn‚Äôt fix this feeling, when will it leave? Will it take someone else to touch the parts of me I hate for me to finally move on from you? I‚Äôm trying so hard, but I have no idea what I‚Äôm working toward...I thank god for waking me up everyday, and keeping me safe until I go to bed each night, but I beg him for someone to cherish and love unconditionally, someone I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm annoying everytime I approach them...someone who cherishes and loves me unconditionally, only me, too. I have to learn to love me, but I don‚Äôt know how, I‚Äôve done so many bad things, made so many poor choices, had so many awful thoughts and terrible desires, and my skin never feels like my own..what is next for me? What will all of this confusion and loneliness lead into, and will it be as beautiful as what we had, and will I be ungrateful, not learn my lesson, and destroy that too? Can people see the hate I harbor for myself and that‚Äôs why they keep leaving? Is god really all I need to fill this hole? I know nothing..everything is open for debate, but I have no side to support, caught in the middle. Come back to me. Make things make sense again..or leave entirely.",lonely,Late night rambles,2020-04-05 09:52:59

I have been in quarantine going on 4 weeks. The first couple weeks I was okay because I was staying active. But the lack of motivation has consumed me. It has left me with a lot of time to think about things, mainly how lonely I really am. 

I would say that in my normal life, a few really good friends. Everyone else are just acquaintances. I have tried many times to make friends online, putting myself out there just to get ghosted. It just so hard when people don‚Äôt really want to put in as much effort as you or the conversation just fizzles out.

Came into my life after a break up, told me she was completely done with him. 3 months of hanging every weekend (something im not accustomed to but I enjoyed it and spending time with her) and her spending the night at my place multiple times, to meeting my parents... to all just be shit on in a couple texts when I told her how I didn‚Äôt really know how she felt about me DESPITE wanting to hang all the time, spend the night, be intimate, meet my parents, etc. 

So I finally asked her if I was just a rebound or not. Was told she ‚Äúfucking misses her ex. Misses her amazing relationship and the the amazing two years she had and that she‚Äôs still healing.‚Äù She told me she was grateful that I have been there to lean on. But assured me I wasn‚Äôt a rebound. Could never give a solid answer about how she felt and the most I got was ‚Äújust know my feelings aren‚Äôt as strong.‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt had a girlfriend in 7 years. This is the closest thing I‚Äôve had to something ‚Äúserious‚Äù in the last half decade. But I feel like I need to just give up at this point. Since our conversation where she shit on me and told me about how she‚Äôs really still not over her ex, she‚Äôs acted completely different. Responds way late. Doesn‚Äôt make plans to hang (not that we really even can, but maybe like a zoom hang or even getting food real fast). Things are completely different rn. 


I just feel lost. Stupid for caring about someone more than they care about me. Silly for thinking I might have something real. Angry because I feel as though I really was just a rebound. And lonely af because with out this,  I have absolutely nothing. I‚Äôm in quarantine. I can‚Äôt go try to distract myself or go meet new people or even just flirt with a cashier to get her off my mind or something. This is fucking terrible and although I wasn‚Äôt in love with this girl or anything, I did like her a lot and the way things have gone, on top of this quarantine shit, has just made me feel so fucking alone.

Unfortunately I've been sick for almost two weeks now and developed pneumonia, I was told by my doctors I didn't have pneumonia, apparently they had someone else read my x-rays and I do. I can't get tested but was told there's a pretty big chance I have coronavirus.   


I had isolated from my family for about 6 days until I felt better because I just assumed I had the flu. My doctor told me I need to isolate, again, for another 7 days. I'm already a pretty lonely person but as long as I could do stuff with my mom it was tolerable. Now I can't see anyone in my house or put them further at risk.   


I have some (two, lol) friends online I talk to but I can't do anything like voice chat because my voice is shot from coughing and talking makes me cough more. I feel so damn alone. I miss my parents, I miss my dogs.

I became too draining for you guys and I‚Äôm not upset with anyone of you four for walking away, I wish I could say otherwise for how I feel about myself however. Even though the four of you seem to borderline despise me and would flee the room if I was present, I still care about you guys. In my final moments and as my heart beats for the last time, I‚Äôll be thinking of the positive memories. You guys will think of me on however you choose to think about me, I can‚Äôt change if you guys perceive my exiting as a pathetic attempt at attention in the near 0% chance any of you will be informed of my absence.

My brother overheard everything she said and claims that it pissed him off but he doesn't want to say or do anything because he doesn't want to start a fight which has caused me to feel like its a them vs me kind of situation.

2606,oddly-,1586021455,1,"Apologize in advance for my english, it‚Äôs not my native language. So, I had a full time nanny (live in) ever since I was born, wasn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt really close with my parents. (I care about them, but our relationship is kind of formal, if that make sense?) anyway, as a kid my parents were busy workaholic and my mother was also taking care of my grandparents in the hospital so I was very dependent on my nanny, physically and emotionally. Also, my mom and dad fought a lot, my dad hit my mom at times, and he always made us watch. Literally he called all of us (the kids) to go into the living/dining room before actually start fighting. Than I would cry, and he gets upset when we cry, and my nanny would console me afterward. Anyway, just saying that bc as a teenager I used to blame that for my lack of socializing skill? But my siblings are all social butterflies so probably it‚Äôs not the case and im just making excuses rip. 
Anyway, I was that quite, polite kid during kindergarten and elementary school. The kind teachers would describe ‚Äúa dream to have in class‚Äù or something like that. My fondest of memory was 4th grade in elementary school, I think that was when I got my first taste of close friendships. We drifted apart after starting junior high school though, unfortunately (we went to different school). I was in one junior high school for one semester but transferred. I already made a friend at the time, so I was a bit upset about transferring. The first semester in my new school, I wasn‚Äôt able to make any friends. I made friends in 8th grade, unfortunately we were scrambled into different classes for the ninth grade, and I didn‚Äôt quiet fit in with my 9th grade class. Anyway, I am rather funny with my friends, but if I don‚Äôt have anyone, I am back to being that quite, polite, boring, recluse kid. Anyway, in those friendships (4th and 8th grade, it was like, in a group, like 5-6 people and I am grateful for them and though I would like to think we were quite close as a group, I didn‚Äôt feel personal connection with any of them if im being honest) 
Anyway, I entered senior high school after that. The memory is still quiet fresh as I only graduated last year. I remember I made it a goal to be more outgoing and hopefully give off more fun, approachable vibe. Not being able to fit in/make friends have always been a fear of mine since elementary school, so I was scared about this as well. My 10th grade class was awesome. I like the whole class but I also had a group of friends. But yeah, the class was awesome, one time the whole class just skipped a class together (except for like, 4 people) and we were scolded together. There were times when like almost 3/4 of the class (like around 20 people) go into one of us house after we went swimming together, and we were working hard together for the art and sport festival. However, they scramble the class in second semester, based on our grade n the first semester. The thing is, I was put into a different class than everyone in my friend group (literally all of them was put into one class! What are the chances?) anyway, I was put into the, idk what you call it in english, but basically if you are put in that class you can finish high school early. I don‚Äôt think I can handle the pressure and with permission from my mom, made formal request to be moved to regular class. I was hoping I can get into my group of friend‚Äôs class, but unfortunately I was put in a different class. I talked to them still, but obviously with them being in one class and im the only one in different class, they are naturally closer together. But the group chat was popping tho. Anyway, I struggled a bit friend wise in my new class. 2.5 years I was there, it seems like I moved between groups several times. Also, and I don‚Äôt mean to brag here, but like, everyone in my year know me, it always happen, from elementary school. I think it‚Äôs because my family is upper middle? I honestly don‚Äôt know how they know because I never brag and I look so fucking plain. Anyway it‚Äôs that situation when everyone know me and my name, some of them say hello in passing but that‚Äôs it. Anyway, this one stings. So I was in 12th grade, my birthday was coming, as per tradition, I was going to treat my friend (here it‚Äôs tradition for the birthday girl/boy to treat her or his friends, I heard it‚Äôs the other way around in some places?) anyway, we already set the date but my mom was asking me to accompany her going to a party she‚Äôs invite to, my siblings weren‚Äôt able to accompany her. I didn‚Äôt want her to go alone so I apologized to my friends (my friend group from 10th grade) and ask wether we can postpone/change the date. Admittedly it was a bit sudden (2 days before the day we were supposed to meet up) but my mom only told me that day. The party was in a city about 45 minutes drive from my city. My family has a house there, so I also gave my friends the option for them to stay there while I accompany my mom to the party and I‚Äôll get back to the house and we can figure out what to do from there. But they never replied to me after that. I was like, okay, they are mad, but I thought it would last maybe 3 days tops. Well, weeks passed, graduation day came, and they still ignored me, didn‚Äôt acknowledge me on graduation. Made a new group chat. Not gonna lie I was sad about it, before they became angry at me the group chat was popping, shitposting, memes, whatever. Anyway, in my country there‚Äôs this program where you can go to public uni without test if your grade continually improve every semester in high school. It‚Äôs very selective though, slight decline and you are out. It also depends on the quota of the course/faculty of your choosing. Each year less than 20% of students can go via this program. I remember when I started high school my mom said I have to be diligent so I can go to uni via this program and I worked hard and I was already accepted but than my parents were like... actually you should study oversea instead since your sister is already there. So my hardwork went down the drain lmao. But anyway, I had to wait a few months until I go to that country (I can go for july intake (graduated in may) but it just felt too sudden for me so I chose the march intake the next year) anyway those long months without having any frend to talk to or meet was... boring and lonely. I pretended that I have friends to my family bc I don‚Äôt want to be seem like a loser (as I told you, my siblings are all social butterflies) so sometimes I would go out somewhere alone but tell my family im meeting my friends. Anyway, I decided to use my time to volunteer in a rural, underprivileged village quite far away from my country (1 hour by plane), 4.5 hours drive from the airport to the village. At first my parents were against it bu I was like lmao yall gonna send me on my own to another country but won‚Äôt let me travel within my own country? And eventually they let me. It was a fullfilling experience and I am grateful, but anyway I went back home after 2 months and felt lonely again. Than it was time to go to that country. I remember feeling sad bc I literally don‚Äôt have to say goodbye to anyone other than my family. Kinda wanna tell about my experience here in this country so far (where I am studying in) but I think this post is already super long so I apologize for that. But yeah, anyway, in my entire life I don‚Äôt think I ever had a close friend and I just long for that kind of connection",lonely,"So I guess this is gonna be a mix of rant and my story?

2609,boiledwagyu,1586017128,1,"I'll try to keep the long story short.
Basically, I (19M) don't have a perfect family life and had never been in love (excluding childhood times). My parents divorced when I was small and I had to tough up and become the center of the family, taking care of my younger brother, do house work and try to manage every interaction by preventing arguments from happening. As a result, I've gotten very used to not telling my family anything, even when I'm really sad and just want some affection I would simply hide my desires and act like the mature and tough son I was. As a result, I've never had a relationship where I can freely express my feelings towards the opposite person. I have really good friends, but they all have their family and partners (yes I'm the only one of all my close friends to have never dated), but as I am not their first priority I always felt a reluctance in reaching out to them too often, just so I don't bother their relationships too much. This is pretty much my back story summarized.

Now, I'm 19 and the aforementioned events happened 10 years ago. Between the 10 years nothing much happened to me, except meeting a bad friend who further destroyed my self worth. 
I'm now a person who laughs a lot on the outside, with people describing me as the most ""optimistic person ever"" or the ""happiest guy ever"". While I am in fact an optimistic person when it comes to life and career, I get really pessimistic when it comes to relationships.",lonely,I'm so lost.

2613,Riverside63,1586012678,1,"So recently, within the past year or so, figured out why I have tried but always pushed away from relationships . I am an old man who has had some wonderful opportunities for some what could have been well fantastic dreams but always had deep trust issues and backed away . Even as an educated guy and knowing at some point inside me there was a problem. Now as a senior as far as numbers go , alone and really afraid of a loveless life . Well through reading and self research figured out that an incident of attempted abuse by a trusted neighbor and early teen stupid relationship breaks well all culminate in a life of looking ok on the outside having some real issues .  To be honest ,  I recently attended a funeral for a girl I grew up with sad enough, but ran into her brother and snapped , beating the guy pretty good and breaking down. They had a big family and his older brother finally got hold of me, we talked alone and he kind of suspected the reasons. After a lifetime apart from childhood relationships . Story got deeper as I learned  from the oldest and the one I attacked left the funeral pretty quick and I learned he was a registered offender which included his own children.  Thinking about it many there were not surprised or offended , even though I did not really stick around. Adding to my issues I recently had a social media request from my first real love into high school years. Blast from the past but a deep cut still, seems all happy lets talk , bla bla bla. Small town life mutual friends telling me she was acquainted with another woman who knows me. Wow it is a lady from college years that I was very close to but actually pulled my life long pull back from just before it got real serious. Again all me and trust issues. The primary forgetting I caught her cheating on me with my friend or so I thought , with a guy a few years older who was my mentor and coach in a sport I was pretty god at. I was always the nice guy and just backed off even though in a few future years a friend who had a baby with her asked me if I was involved with her. I never said anything but knew who may have been the guy getting in on the lady. Always just shutting up.  So now I am alone in life and maybe figured out how my youth and life of trust issues  has cost me or caused me to do what I did many times. I don't feel better only alone in a world where I see beauty in woman of all ages , and live life alone in all aspects, not close to anyone without a feeling for purpose or motivation.

2627,swordofvictory,1585987240,1,"I don't know why I am posting this, I just, need to get it out. 

I've been lonely forever. I've never had a family that was there for me - in a massive family, I was always treated as not human and isolated. I crave having someone that loves me for who I am, unconditionally, and I've never had that.

I know, most families have problems. But most families go through ups and downs and they still have memories of happiness with their families. Maybe not always, but just at some times. But I don't even have 1 memory of happiness. It's either abuse, or doing absolutely nothing. I was denied ALL happiness as a child. I lived in the Middle East for most of it and every family member likes to remind me how bad I had it. 

They treated me differently than everyone else, abused and neglected me to an extent that no one else experienced. I felt alone and I just wanted someone to love me. I was always told the most horrible things and I have far too many stories of abuse. The only people that loved me all died... my brother died when he was 14 and it killed me. I'm still not over his murder. I miss him so much. 

-

I don't want to be gay. I hate the feeling so much. But I don't think it's my fault. I know that children who have been abused typically turn out gay and hopefully that's the reason. But it makes me physically sick to even think about being gay. 

I don't even have any friends. I've only really made 1 real friend in my life and (because I'm gay) kinda liked her for more than a friend, which was just painful. Then she moved away, which just broke my heart. 

The only person I actually trust is a teacher and that's just depressing. The school holidays (it's holidays in Australia) is the most painful time because I can't talk to him about it. 

My family are really Middle Eastern - unlike me, who has left Islam and Westernized, I like to read books instead of yell about the Quran - and they don't let me leave the house apart from going to school. 

I'm generally someone who doesn't have emotions, but now I'm experiencing a level of depression and anxiety that I have never experienced before. I also have really bad flashbacks at night and I can't sleep.

TLDR; My childhood was FULL of abuse and neglect, I was never permitted a day of happiness, my family hates me, I don't have any friends, I am gay and it breaks my heart... and the only person I trust is my teacher.

It was a complicated relationship, long distance, he was in a different stage of his life, etc. I understand why it didn't last. But I let myself fall in love for some reason and now it's over. One thing I didn't anticipate about being broken up with was how lonely it is. Out of all the people in the world, there is one person who understands the most about what you're going through. A person who understands everything you went through down the path to love and what everything meant to you. And that person is the one person that you can't talk to. It's agonizing. 

About a month after I got broken up with, me and a friend started hooking up, and eventually classified ourselves as friends with benefits. It's kind of perfect because neither of us are ready for a relationship (he also just got out of a relationship), but we've known each other for years and are great friends, and are also highly attracted to one another. That relationship I have with him does a lot for me, and gives me someone I can rely on completely. But there's something missing and I can't stop thinking about it. 

It's the hand reaching out to yours while you're walking, the cute smile that that one person reserves just for you, the knowledge that you're important to someone, and that they think of you and, when they do, that same smile etches onto their face. Random gestures to show that you care, checking in, hugs from the back, kisses on the cheek, binge-watching movies together. It's that romantic, loving side of the relationship. Me and my friend don't have that because we're not in a relationship, we have platonic love and sexual attraction and that's about it. 

But now I've realized that that's the thing that I miss the most. That loving side of a relationship. Don't get me wrong, hooking up is fun, but there's only so much satisfaction it can give you- well, for me at least. 

I think the most messed up part of it all, is that I want that stuff so much, but anytime anyone shows that they may offer that to me, I back out. Because I'm afraid to have my heart broken again, for someone to walk away again, because I know that they will.

I almost constantly just want to be left alone because other people seem to always demean me or act like total morons. But there's also a part of me that wants the classic big group of guy friends (most of my friends throughout my life have been girls) that continue being bros after highschool &amp; college.

And of course I want the old-fashioned wife and kids (crucify me, idc). So I'm confused...

Is anyone else like this? Do you find social interaction often exhausting, but also *yearn* (weird fckn word) for it?

I appreciate any insight anyone can think of, all I really want is reassurance. If you're interested in more backstory, I'll gladly oblige. If I know one thing, it's that aside from this; my situation is wack.",lonely,Can anyone relate to me at all?,2020-04-04 17:22:42

2637,coffeenpills,1585978487,1,"So many people are lonely because of rejection. Or they miss that one somebody. Or perhaps they just don‚Äôt have the guts to talk to that *one somebody*. 

But damn. I just don‚Äôt know how to feel anymore. I can‚Äôt love platonically, much less romantically. 

I am disposable to everyone. I usually befriend the ‚Äúoutcasts‚Äù. It‚Äôs normally a one way street: They talk of their problems. I help them out. I‚Äôm still a mysterious figure to them. If I do share anything personal, it‚Äôs usually with no emotion. I just state my burdens stoically, as facts. Once they find their niche, they bid farewell to me for good. No hard feelings. No bad blood. I was just their jumpstart. I have no emotional attachment to them. They still acknowledge me, but it‚Äôs nothing more than routine. Then they stop even acknowledging me. 

I so painfully long to feel something about this all. I want to be able to talk candidly about my life. But my reality is far too much for anyone. How can I talk about the weather and sports when depression and ptsd constantly scrape my mind utterly raw? How can I care about what I wear, when I‚Äôm working my ass off just to stay afloat and keep my mouth shut? How can I desire any form of intimacy without harboring constant terror of being taken advantage of? Slandered? Attacked? Raped? I don‚Äôt know how to fucking love anymore. I can‚Äôt. I want to so badly, but the best I can do is indifferent. Indifferent? Is that what someone wants in a friend? My abrasive unlikableness doesn‚Äôt help either. Indifferent is as positive as I can feel, but there is plenty worse to be seen. I rarely smile. Not because I‚Äôm a *BaD AsS*, but because smiling gets you nothing but motherfucking trauma. Plus, smiling is a pain when you feel nothing of the sort. It kind of disgusts me, when people smile all the time. Even when they‚Äôre being an absolute bitch. If you‚Äôre gonna be a bitch, be a straight up bitch, no need to be two-faces about it. Oddly enough, usually, the only times I smile outside the confines of my house are when I‚Äôm in severe psychological pain. I call it the Overcompensation Station ^TM .

I dream, sometimes, of finding someone (which is the most ridiculously far-fetched thing I‚Äôve ever heard), but those thoughts usually turn sour. I‚Äôve given up on the dream of changing. It‚Äôs going on 4 years now. 4 damn years filled with therapy and psychiatrists and medicines and coping skills. And I still want to die. Something is so broken inside me, severed even, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to be normal again. ‚ÄúBut, coffeenpills, normal is a relative term,‚Äù they say. Shut the fuck up. Just stop. I‚Äôm in the slimmest percent of so many things. I‚Äôve had a psychiatrist tell me they‚Äôve never met a fucking patient like me before. Another said that I should fix *myself*. I‚Äôm the broken of the broken. The outcast of outcasts. The laughing stock of the abused jesters. And I wish I could cease.

2660,throwaway543678910,1585967217,1,"Just venting (quarantine is giving me a lot of time to think lol). Any wisdom is appreciated if you‚Äôve been where I am! 

I‚Äôve seen a lot on here that the quarantine is making people aware of how lonely they are. It‚Äôs very easy to feel that way with social media, seeing everyone who‚Äôs posting their FaceTime hangouts and all the Instagram story tags. It‚Äôs hit me the same way. It‚Äôs difficult. 

For me, I always had a group of friends to hang out with since elementary school. I was lucky in middle school to connect with a group and always hang out after school at someone‚Äôs house and go to a sleepover at least every other weekend. I stuck with most of them throughout high school, meeting new people along the way. I had periods each summer when things quieted down where I worried I didn‚Äôt have enough friends, but it went away as soon as I got back to school. By the time I graduated HS, my friend group fizzled out, I had a falling out with one girl as well, and I worried I wouldn‚Äôt make any friends in college. I was pleasantly surprised and made a new group of friends when I moved into my dorm. Funny enough, each summer I still worried I didn‚Äôt have enough friends. I was sensitive to feeling left out if I saw people doing something without me, but I hid it well. I did a lot of extracurricular things in college, including plays and improv so I always had people to see and hang out with. And then I graduated and life evolved again. 

I don‚Äôt talk to any of the people I met in the dorms or from my extracurricular groups. Some have removed me off social media. I have one close friend who I talk to at least once a month, my boyfriend, my family, and that‚Äôs it. I miss having people in my life. And the sad thing looking back on all of those times is that I think I was a pretty forgettable person to all of these people. I‚Äôve tried reaching out to some that I miss and used to have wonderful conversations with and it doesn‚Äôt seem to refresh anything, so I let it go and try to make peace with the fact that our friendship is not the same anymore and it‚Äôs okay that we‚Äôve gone in different directions. But as well as I handle those moments, I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt hurt. No one reaches out to me and it reinforces how lonely I feel. I have a problem with social media and comparing myself to others on there, so I have time limits set on my apps so I don‚Äôt subject myself to it. At my current job, I don‚Äôt connect with any of my coworkers. I don‚Äôt really like them as people on top of that, so that whole situation is pretty crummy. I have an urge to change my life once the quarantine ends, but I don‚Äôt know how. I just want fresh faces, to make new connections, to build a support system, to feel loved. But considering my track record, I worry I‚Äôll never make lasting friendships. It‚Äôs rough. 

Anyway, thank you if you‚Äôve read through all of this. I hope this resonates with someone else and makes them feel less alone in this experience.

2675,DioRemTW,1585957405,1,"Hello everyone. This is probably going to be a long post mainly because I'm just venting. English is not my main language so my apoligies if this is a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's begin. I have social anxiety, which of course makes almost impossible to meet new people irl. And for some reasons I pushed away my only friends 4 years ago. Since then I've met some random people, but I didn't get close again with anyone. So, for my mental health's sake, I had to look for people on the internet. Meeting people online has been a vicious circle to me: The initial euphoria of meeting someone you get along with, that euphoria slowly fades away and there's no interesting conversations in a couple days. Sometimes I meet someone I like, and, I guess it's mostly because I'm afraid of losing them, I become so clingy and overdependant on that person, so when they dump me I feel like shit.

I'm trying to take a break of social media (mainly apps to meet people, for my own sanity I won't stop scrolling reddit) because it hurts meeting people then watching them slowly getting bored of you.

I also have been blocked by people for absolutely no reason, it makes no sense because we were talking and getting along just fine. It's disheartening.

I'm trying to drop my thoughts here but it seems that I can't write english properly when I'm so tired and depressed.

I expected this to be longer, but I'm so pathetic, I won't find someone who'll stick around without me ruining it sooner or later.

Jeez. Thanks for reading, and I wish you have a good day.",lonely,The more people I meet the more I realize I'm alone.,2020-04-04 10:43:25

2677,LordMoy,1585953479,1,"I've been browsing all the friendship subreddits for quite a while now, probably on and off for most of the time I've been on Reddit. And yet I still haven't made a friend yet through them. I can count of people I've messaged on both my hands.

Besides skipping the thirsty people and 1 sentence description people, I noticed that I end up reading a post and don't message them or even leave a comment. At most I'll give them an upvote. I can't get the feeling out of my head that I'm being needlessly picky about this. 

I feel like I'm looking for the ""perfect"" friend but that's just not realistic. I doubt people who have friends share 100% of the common interests/hobbies. Yet they still are friends. So why can't I do the same? Why am I looking for a 90-100% match when realistically it'll be around 50% or even less? There's an expectation bar I'm setting which no one is passing. Or is finding friends online in itself flawed?

2678,Four_oh_2,1585953431,1,"I would say that's the worst part about being someone that seems to chronically not find people at all or people who take the time to understand you. I've gone through periods of time where I've been completely alone with no one to talk to for months on end. To recent times where I've actually gathered a handful of good friends, which I am very grateful for having because I understand some people don't even have that. But it seems like whenever I try to get very real about myself with them, about problems or thoughts I've had everyday for years. Things that have lead to who I am today. It's seems like they almost never can relate. All I get are stares, and rehearsed responses like what i just opened up about is unfathomable to them. But I know they care about me. Which starts to make me worried that even if I become more sociable and start gathering more ""friends"", I'll always have to live a lie. Burning inside. This Quarantine isn't helping. Even though I'm used to being alone the feeling of being trapped is making a lot of bad memories and feelings resurface. I needed to finally vent.

2680,Roy_Kai,1585952587,1,"I'm not even sure if I still fit in here these days.  Cause I really thought I'd leave for good.

Times are rough I guess. After all this time, I finally have the social skills to not be called awkward, boring, weird, or quiet. The looks to at least be somewhat average and not completely repulsive to girls. Enough of a social circle, interests, hobbies, and such to not be alone.

Yet at the time, there's really no one I'm close to. I guess it's my own fault, and underlying issues I just don't know how to fix. Whenever I get too close to someone, I seem to just instinctively... Run away? It's not like I'm too anxious to socialize or shy. But when you're close to people, there's just so much more to worry about. Impressing them. Trusting them. Being able to communicate. Having to dedicate time to them. All things I'm perfectly willing and want to do. But it's just scary actually doing it, I guess. I guess I'm just worried about disappointing them. But it's always been something that's been pretty well hidden in the background of most of my connections. It's stronger now than ever. 

I guess to put it simply. I just feel really down right now, due to a multitude of dumb life stresses and internal conflicts. And whenever I feel this way or focus on a problem I'm trying to fix too hard, though I'd love to be my normal, fun, preppy self. My personality always shifts to this emotionally distant, cold, quiet, uncaring, and boring person, that well, pretty much no one in my circles likes, but I can't help it. To make things worse, it's not consistent üòë. So one minute I'm normal, and then next, buzzkill me. So to prevent them seeing that side of me (cause last time I let it show, things just went awful for everyone). I'm just isolating myself. Not talking to anyone at all. But it's really a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

I guess my friends (other than the closest ones who understand) just feel like I'm ignoring them? Or that I don't like them anymore? Like I can feel they're clearly a bit disappointed when I cancel or turn down plans. Or take too long to reply to their messages or leave them on read. But I'm just not in the mental state to interact with them, and they don't get it. If I do, I'll just be... Well, a dick, unknowingly, and I'd rather stop myself before that happens, because then they'd just hate me. But you can only say you need ""space"" for so long until people just forget about you or stop liking you.

Out of the people i'm closest to. I just feel too numb to connect with them. My 2 best friends understand how I am at times, so I'm not too worried about them, though I'd rather get out of this state quick, cause they really are starting to get tired of me always being so distant from them. I had 2 other people I consider best friends, and well, 1 I lost from not restraining my ""dark side"" and we don't talk anymore, which hurts. And the other I distanced myself from for so long that he kind of moved on and we're like strangers now. I had this girl I really loved, but idk if it's just lack of compatibility, and an inability to communicate, meaning we're not right for eachother, or if we just have problems to work out, but it seems with her if I stay too long when I'm down I'll eventually hurt her, but if I distance myself which I'm doing now, from her, I hurt her too, and I just can't get her to understand that I still love her but need space, or maybe I'm just explaining it in the worst way possible. My parents haven't ever really cared about anything about me that's unrelated to health, academics, or work, (2/3 which are going awfully, so I'd rather not talk to them), so I can't go to them either. And well, there's my younger sister. But I care about her too much to let all this baggage drop on her.

I guess I just thought I finally became a normal social person. But deep down, I'm a depressed, impulsive, cold, narcissistic, mess of a person. And though that side doesn't always show. When it does, it hurts everyone around me. And when I distance myself to not show it to people, everyone gets tired of me being so distant from them, move on, and find new people. I just really don't feel deserving of having anyone in my life.

Lonely, despite ""ascending"" from these subs and not being alone anymore. And like an imposter who doesn't belong around normal people, so I have to selectively show my good sides, and hide my bad ones to avoid being hated and pushed away.",lonely,"Feel stuck, lost, and undeserving",2020-04-04 09:23:07

I‚Äôve been kicked, beaten and dragged in the dirt. Both by a member of my own family, and by my peers. Both physically, and emotionally. When I was twelve I got bullied and when I said a simple ‚Äústop‚Äù, I ended up numerous severe injuries and a short coma.

I‚Äôm a very loving person, I care a lot about my friends and the people around me. I love going out with people and just having a fun time- I‚Äôm extroverted and am trying to get my teaching degree in Biology. My personality is a very ‚Äúmama- bear‚Äù type of style. I come from a Southern rooted environment and have dreamt about finding my husband, planning our wedding, and having kids of my own in my twenties. 
Recently, I‚Äôve become so lonely to the point that I will find myself crying because of how empty my heart feels.

My entire life everyone has told me how beautiful I am, and I know they‚Äôre not saying it just to make me feel better. I take my occasional selfies and feel great about myself for a day or 2. Then, reality hits. 
I‚Äôve always been overweight (not obese) - it‚Äôs the truth. I gain weight very easily from a thyroid condition- and my parents have always told me horrible things about how much I weigh or how I look in certain outfits, etc. And- these comments constantly flood my head when I try to put myself out there to date.. 
So that‚Äôs what happened with hockey guy, when he told me he wanted to hold me close, my thoughts were
- wow, he‚Äôs probably gonna touch my stomach and think I‚Äôm fat 
- or he‚Äôs going to compare me to his teammates skinny toothpick hockey girlfriends
-how am I going to date such a fit guy like this?

This makes it really hard for me to connect with people because I've always been focused on education and my intellectual development to meet the expectations that were put on me and I never developed emotionally.
A month or 2 after starting university, I started having feelings for 1 of my close friends, this opening up a new range of emotions that are still very alien to me. Eventually, me and this friend had a chat and decided to remain friends. That hurt but at least we were still really good friends.

About 2 months after all of that, me and her started disagreeing and arguing a lot over the most insignificant things, almost as if we were intentionally trying to hurt each other. This lead to us deciding to take a break from being friends. In the space of a week, we went from spending a minimum of 3hrs a day texting, on the phone or actually doing something together to 0 contact.
At this point, I started having a lot of problems. It started as just loneliness and feeling as though I had been broken up with, evolving into low self-esteem, self-hatred, self-deprication and depression which just keeps getting worse. I've tried getting a referral for some counselling but everything is shutdown because of the Coronavirus pandemic. Being locked down at home also hasn't helped, increasing the rate that the problems are growing at exponentially compared with while I was at university.

It has been 3 months since that happened and I'm now at a point where I can't get through a day without having had at least 4 anxiety attacks with depressive episodes that will last 2-3 days at a time.
Before all of this occurred, I was able to compartmentalise all my thoughts and feelings but since my ""break up"", this hasn't been possible at all.

Of course I have friends, but sometimes I feel out of place with them. That's why I spend my break and lunchtimes alone. 

While I sit staring at my phone, or reading a book (yes I am a total nerd), or simply doing nothing, I keep looking around to see if someone might notice me and talk to me. No one. Not even my crush (well he'd probably be staring at me).

I'm not a very talkative person at school. I'm also terribly shy. So I think if anyone came up to talk to me I'd mess it up big time. I often get on with my school day very quietly while everyone else around me is socializing just fine. Do I maybe have social anxiety?",lonely,I feel invisible to most people.,2020-04-04 04:49:18
2705,comradefromtheeast,1585936034,2,"I dropped out of school a couple years ago to focus on something else, and even though I feel much better doing my thing, every single day I feel painfully aware that I've lost all my friends. I wasn't a lonely person at school, I've had friends that I felt like I would be together for a lifetime, yet now I realize that I've lost them without even noticing. Days go by one by one and looking back, I don't have a single guy to talk to.


This made me desperate to have some kind of an emotional connection with someone, anyone and then I happened to meet a girl online, someone who lives in another part of the globe. Maybe it's cus that she's been my only friend for a year by now, I've grown so attached to her, more than I've been with anyone else. All this without even seeing her. But everything has to end, right? I feel like she's moving on, I mean, you can't do much with someone you know just through texts. This makes me realize the position I'm gonna be in very soon, she's able to move on to other friends of hers and be happy and feel in company, while I can't even keep her out of my thoughts for a moment. Everything I see connects to her and our conversations in some way, and I want it to remain magical like how it was, even as I know it's impossible. She's able to ""get bored"" and ignore my texts for days, that's normal, people grow apart, but what hurts is that I can't do the same to her. Or to anyone else. I still miss people I had split with years ago, it still hurts me while I'm sure that they've forgotten all memories of me. I just... wanna stop caring for them. I want to have other friends I can move on to, but I don't. 


And I do feel like I'm worrying too much for nothing, it's all a part of life isn't it?

2709,falsified-alt,1585933394,3,"Im not entirely sure why as I had been trying to reach out to friends prior to this lockdown and covid stuff. No body ever wants to hang out. Most of the time i just get left on read or some have the respect to just decline hanging out for one reason or another. This has beeb going on over the last few years. Slowly i went from a popular guy with a decent amount of friends. I get as adults our schedules dont always have similar free times. But the Last time i saw a friend outside of my family was back around Christmas/Halloween-ish 2019 (somewhere between those months) it gad gotten so bad that when me and my ex split up i had to move back in with family because none of my friends that would still reply to me didnt have room. At this point i cut nearly everybody who always leave me on read out of my life. If they cant spare a minute or two to talk in a time of need, or ever for that matter than I guess I could pick a better friend. (To clarify some of these people have left me on read for multiple messages over the course of months. They plenty of time to respond when time opened up.) This left me back at my familys home, with like 5 friends that would still message or whatever and 2 of them over the next year took time to hang out with me. They were very appreciated days. Over the course of a year, these five friends still talking to me dwindled down too these last twothat were willing to actually hangout. And around Halloween/christmas I saw 1 friend for a beer and havent herd from him since. And the other friend mostly has been quiet and I have been as well. 

To continue, my life growing up had been filled with my father making fun of me, growing up (I am a male) I had grown my hair out, by grown out i mean the hair on my hairline barely touched my chin. So maybe 7 inch long hair. And my father would always tell me to cut my hair because i look like a woman, would buy me ""gag gifts"" of tampons and mention how cute id look in that dress at the store. My older brother just kind of up and left us all when he turned 18, over the years my younger sister has said she just tolerates me being around,  my mother is the type that when I pet her dog and it for appearantly no reason decided to bite me, she yelled at me and started asking me why i was harassing the dog. Basically my point with that is its been like that with her over the last like 12 years (im 28 now). And all of this must have affected my home life because my youbger brotger has announced to me that he cant stand being around me and is moving half eay across the country to not have to be around me. 

I have 1 friend who basically never talks to me anymore. And im stuck in a house around people who dont care about me and dont want to be around me. And I have no way out because literally everybody ive known has left except 1 guy who is married and has a busy life.  

I giggle to myself when I see those posts like hey check on your ""insert stereotypical extrovert type or person"" they dont do good being alone. They dont even know the meaning of alone. 

But ALAS, i wish to not be here any longer. I dont want to have to deal with the loneliness anymore. BUT... momma aint raise no quitter. So that option doesnt work for me  I might be the saddest ive ever been in my life, but im not that weak. 

TL;DR
My childhood wasnt great. Lost all but 1 friend who rarely has time to chat. Family doesnt want to be around me but I have no other option but to live with them ir be homeless.

So a year ago i was in a really rough place and started seeing a therapist because i was feeling lonely and depressed all the time. I told him that I didn‚Äôt have any friends or anyone to make me feel socially connected and this 
1. Made me feel super down and lonely all the time, (especially on weekends) and
2. Made me really question my worth as a person.

****He told me that even though in my current situation I didn‚Äôt have anyone to connect with, this didn‚Äôt mean I was a bad person or I was doomed to live my life without buddies. He said it was most likely due to the fact that I was constantly surrounded by the same handful of people every day and that i just didnt happen to click with anyone around me.****

He was right! A few months from him saying this new people had entered my life and others had exited, and I clicked with a few of the new people and now find myself in a great friend group.

The lesson here is to trust life and trust the fact that things change!!!!

Yesterday, after a few months of growing more and more distant, I texted her and told her I couldn't continue to try and be in her life because it hurts too much to be put off to the side all the time. Her response shattered me. She basically told me that when she met me she had no one else and that's why we were so close. Now she has more friends so she can't keep up with me anymore.

I was there for her whenever she needed, sat on the phone when all she could do was cry because she was so depressed. I would talk her out of self harming when she was really bad, at least I would try to. We shared details of our lives with eachother that were personal and sacred. I promised never to judge her, and I still stand by that.

As for human contact I‚Äôll talk to my teachers if asked a question I might talk to one of my peers if they engage me first and when I get home I might talk to one of my parents for a bit since I have no siblings to chat with. I have no idea how I haven‚Äôt gone crazy yet.

2744,seasidecrowbar,1585888322,1,"I dated this guy (25M) for about 10 months. At the start it was really great, but overtime things turned sour and we realized that we just weren't right for eachother. We weren't abusive towards eachother persay, but we argued a lot, always were super passive aggressive with eachother and just weren't a good fit. 
   In the past 4 months since our breakup, I can't shake my reoccurring feelings of loneliness and longing. Once you add in the recent events related to social distancing, it gets way worse. Everyday I wake up and I realize that I have no one and that I'll have to learn to accept the fact that it's just going to be me myself and I for a while. 
   I want to loved, I want to have a sense of belonging, I want someone to be with me, I want to not be lonely. I want these things so much that I am totally ok with going back to being in an unhappy and unfulfilling relationship, just to have the feeling that I'm not alone.
   I would go back to being in a relationship where nights end in slammed doors and days begin in awkward silences if it meant that I would feel as if I would have a companion, that I had a place in someone's life, that I wasn't all alone, that it wouldn't just be me left alone with my doubts, fears, and insecurities.
   At the end of the day, all anyone really wants is to have a person to spend their life with. In some cases they want that so bad, that they'll do practically anything for it, good or bad.

2751,hamartiated,1585885040,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-03 14:37:20

2754,soileilunetoile,1585883070,1,"I generally try pretty hard to stay optimistic and positive, but I‚Äôm really struggling tonight and could just use some reassurance. 

It‚Äôs been a hard year(ish). Dealt with some pretty serious health stuff with my dad in Feb ‚Äò19, got dumped by my fianc√© in April ‚Äò19 (and later found out he left me for another girl who is younger, prettier, thinner and just all around better than me; he ended our engagement in a text message, lied to me about why he left, and was almost certainly cheating with this girl - emotionally if not yet physically), I‚Äôve had a series of expensive events with my animals (vet bills in the THOUSANDS of dollars, which includes a surgery for my dog because he ruptured a disc and without the surgery would have been paralyzed at best), a generally precarious situation at work (higher ed in a program whose funding keeps getting cut PLUS I work for someone who is literally causing me to go insane), and now I‚Äôm trapped at home and have lost my second job (which is literally what pays my rent) because of the pandemic. I have a sinus surgery scheduled for the middle of the month which I absolutely cannot afford, but I also can‚Äôt afford not to have it done for health reasons. I‚Äôm exhausted all the time, I‚Äôm gaining weight I don‚Äôt need to gain because I‚Äôm in so much pain (and also can‚Äôt BREATHE, see the need for the surgery), so I feel fat and ugly and generally gross. I have a ton of debt; I‚Äôm able to pay it (or at least I have been - not having this second job is seriously scary and there is very little opportunity to find something else here at the moment because everything is locked down and laying people off). It‚Äôs been over a year since I‚Äôve had any kind of intimate contact with anyone, (and I mean that literally, not even so much as a HUG) and dating has been a joke even before quarantine hit - college town where I definitely don‚Äôt fit the general demographic, plus see above fat and ugly and gross.

Long story short, I‚Äôm lonely and sad and freaking out a little bit. 

I don‚Äôt really have any friends; I have a few acquaintances that I am in no way comfortable talking about any of this, and the couple actual friends I have have heard all of this feeling sorry for myself so much that I‚Äôm afraid to push them away by talking about it any more. I don‚Äôt want to burden them any further, and I‚Äôm sick of hearing about me - so I know they must be. 

But I was speaking to someone on Reddit recently, and I think they meant well, but their response to everything I said (when I was really making an effort NOT to complain) was to say how bad my life sucks and how hard what I‚Äôve gone through is and how glad they are not to be me. Which, yeah, it does suck. Yes, it has been that long. No, there‚Äôs nothing left to cut or sell or whatever. Thanks for reminding me how shitty everything is day in and day out, as if I didn‚Äôt spend every waking hour trying (and often failing, no matter how hard I try) NOT to let that overwhelm me. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, you‚Äôre an angel. I think I needed a little bit of an outlet just so this wasn‚Äôt all in my head, but if anybody has some kind words or whatever, I would appreciate it.",lonely,Having a rough night. 32F if it makes a difference to you.,2020-04-03 14:04:30

All of them Ive known them for 4+ years, some of these people felt like fucking brothers to me. Some of these ""friends"" were people I shared every secret and piece of emotional baggage sometime in the past, and they understood and were empathetic. One guy I knew for 8 years; I haven't really kept up with him since 2018 but I saw he was online so I asked him to join my voice chat. He ended up inviting me to a chat he was already in and it was bunch of his Christian republican baseball friends (I'm trying to describe a certain stereotype, but idk what it is) so I kinda felt alienated, but it was whatever. Later on I get kicked from the voice chat so I messaged him but no reply. The thing is it feels like he couldn't give a single fuck but 2 years ago I remember him as a totally different person. The Trey I knew (dude's name) 2 years ago cheered me up when I got down and was always down to play games with me literally anytime. That person listened to everything I had to say going to shit in my life. Last night, I couldn't recognize that person. I'm crying right now as I think about it because of how much I miss that Trey, and how much better it made me feel when he wanted to spend time with me when no one else wanted to. Then, there's this other guy I texted; Tassos. Joined his lobby on a game and he removed me from the lobby right away. The text I sent him right after was along the lines of ""was just trying to catch up with an old friend, but I guess that doesn't matter"". I haven't really been up to date with him either since mid 2019, but we were practically best friends in elementary and middle school. We did a ton of shit together. We went to the mall, movies, his house, and to the parks countless times over the years. We both loved football even though we kinda sucked at it. I remember 75% of our time together was either playing Madden or some kinda game with an actual football. I had on odd personality, some people at school thought I was gay probably but he didn't give a shit. There was a time in 7th grade when one of our football teammates practically fought me and I loss before the fight even started. People thought I was a total loser and a pussy but Tassos didn't give a shit about that either. He wasn't worried about if I wasnt cool or people looked down on me. He just cared about us hanging out and being bros. Then we started to distance eventually, and he became a totally different person, shutting me out. But I learned a year later that his parents had divorced, which explained his odd behavior the year prior. So after learning that, I forgave him in my mind and in late 2018 we started to become bros again. Unfortunately I was an asshole my freshman year of high school and I'm surprised our re connection lasted as long as it did; until this school year. This school year we didn't have any classes together so we distanced again. So, about an hour ago, I see he is online, and I think I'll have a convo with him while we game, and as you, the reader, may know, he had removed me from the game lobby. I've already spilled so much onto the internet to people I don't even know, so I won't detail about the 2 other people. But this shit sucks.

My childhood was alright, and my life may have some ups and downs, but it's pretty stable right now.
I'm immature and very much alone.
I've always been a quiet kid. I was a little bit too proud and a real crybaby.
I really felt devastated after my mother died and I had to move in with a father who I didn't know much about.
But it happened when I was 14 years old and now i'm 17 and It still hurts.
Everything kinda hurts.
I have been taught to fake my smile and to never complain. Actually I was often ridiculed when I did.
So I've been faking from a while now, and I've become pretty good at it.
I'm just so used to never talk about things that are meaningful to me, it hurts when I do.
I wish I had more friends.
I never really had a lot of them.
People often say I'm weird, or they just avoid or act mean.
I guess it's easier to hang out with the cool kids.
I wish i was cool. I'm not cool at all.
I wish I could drink with someone instead of drinking rum and vodka all alone.
I've been thinking about panick attacks.
They come sometimes.
Last time the teacher got really mad at a troublesome student.
I didn't even knew her name but I emphatized with her cries and I started shaking and I wasn't able to breathe or concentrate on anything.

I'm used to reduce all of the things that could cause me stress but everyday that passes my loneliness fills me up with self doubt.
I keep on feeling bad about myself because nobody really loves me.

* Being bullied

* Passive-aggressively shunning you
* Laughing about you behind your back
* Intentionally (or even unintentionally) excluding you from social events
* Being left on read constantly by someone
* Feeling that other people don't care about you or what you have to say (this may or may not be true, you just kinda have to vibe it out)
* No one approaching you to talk, resulting in you having nobody to talk to
   * Even if you want to approach someone, everyone's talking to each other, so there's no way to ""fit in"". Not to mention if you have social anxiety due to past rejections, it makes it even harder.
* People walking away from you when you try to have a conversation with them
* Running into someone you haven't seen in a while, and expecting ""We should catch up sometime over coffee!"" and not getting that

Everything went well....we went on various dates and would act like a couple.

I wouldn‚Äôt push her away after she told me this, I knew she just got out of a bad relationship so I was okay with it. I had a lot of patience with her and would reinforce my patience to her constantly

We would go on to meet up a few times and do the nasty and she would always tell me how much she enjoyed it...I thought I had her in the bag, our conversation were great and the days we hanged out were almost perfect. 

We would meet up for what I didn‚Äôt know was the last time on 3/17  and do the nasty again, then we would spend the entire night just talking with each other (something tells me now that she wanted more action cause she randomly asked me ‚Äúdo you think I‚Äôm too horny‚Äù and now that I think about it I gave a horrible response )

Then she goes MIA on me for roughly 1.5 weeks....were the only contact I had with her was because I would try and double text...triple text sometimes even four and all I would get was a small simple response and when I tried to follow up she would avoid me.

I‚Äôm not sure where to start. I was best friends with someone for a few years, we‚Äôll call Doot. Yes, Doot. Things started off rough early on, Doot would send me unsolicited nsfw pics and links of nsfw stuff and it made me really uncomfortable, red flag, I know. For this, I stopped all contact with him for several months, which he as confused about. Yes, I basically ghosted him. I no longer ghost people as I‚Äôm a much better communicator, but when I‚Äôm being mistreated in a sexual way, I kinda clam up due to past sexual traumas... which I didn‚Äôt understand at the time... and I know now why I ghosted him. Anyways, we talked about it later on and he apologized for it. We‚Äôre all good now, so I thought. 

*The good times*

Time goes on and at this point I‚Äôm in a relationship, Doot is a normal friend and our friendship is great. We help each other through a number of issues and enjoy talking about topics like Chinese history, YouTube drama, shows, mental health, etc. We‚Äôd talk (voice chat) almost daily and usually for hours at a time. 

My toxic relationship is finally over. What a great feat I had overcome, Doot helped me through a lot of this. I felt I finally had a ‚Äúbest best friend.‚Äù 

Eventually Doot realized he had feelings for me, which I didn‚Äôt share for him. He told me it wouldn‚Äôt change our friendship and that because we had should a great friendship he would be much worse off without me. I was glad we had each other still. I‚Äôd always refer to doot as ‚Äúmy best friend ____‚Äù every time I mentioned him to anyone. I made sure everyone knew he was my #1, and no other friend was before him. 

*Shit hits the fan*

But then everything changed when I I became ready to meet someone new and it wasn‚Äôt him... problems started to arise. Doot was resentful of me for not being into him, he would even tell me ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in love with me deep down and you want to be with me.‚Äù Which I would politely and carefully try to refuse. 

He even mentioned once that if he kept saying it eventually I would believe it and laughed after... I‚Äôm starting to think he was trying to manipulate my feelings then. It makes me sick to my stomach if he really was going for that. 

Doot would tell me I‚Äôm ‚Äúimmature,‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt understand‚Äù how I feel. He‚Äôd tell me I‚Äôm autistic, even after I told him multiple times he doesn‚Äôt have the authority to say that. But unfortunately, It got me believing that maybe he‚Äôs right, maybe I don‚Äôt get how I feel. 

He‚Äôd tell me I would regret not being with him later on, he‚Äôd tell me my taste in men was ‚Äúweird‚Äù and everyone I thought was attractive was ‚Äúugly,‚Äù 99% of the time. 

During all this he was making inappropriate comments about me constantly, even while on speaker and when my mom was around. At first I would just pretend like I didn‚Äôt hear, or I‚Äôd try to change the subject, and often say ‚Äúokay stop.‚Äù But he would just laugh it off and say ‚ÄúI love how uncomfortable you get.‚Äù This is heartbreaking thinking about it now. Doot knew about my past sexual abuse traumas and still did all of this. Eventually, I jokingly would say ‚Äúokay I‚Äôm gonna kill you,‚Äù and then later and more frequently I‚Äôd just say ‚ÄúOKAY STOP.‚Äù Everyday he‚Äôd make some sexual comment about me, multiple times a day and it made me feel sad/weird/angry/resentful. 

*The excuses*

When id confront him on this he‚Äôd give me some excuse about how he‚Äôs British and since I‚Äôm American I‚Äôm just a prude and that I need to lighten up. 

He‚Äôd also use his friendship with another person we‚Äôll call beep to justify his behaviors. According to doot, beep was all for doots ‚Äújokes.‚Äù Although they weren‚Äôt nearly as bad towards her because she was in a relationship and he didn‚Äôt have feelings for her. Completely different situation imo. 

Another excuse: Him having autism. 
I know this is an excuse because he didn‚Äôt act this way towards me when I was in a relationship, I would never allow that out of respect for my partner. 

He had more respect for another dude‚Äôs boundaries than his own ‚Äúbest friend‚Äôs.‚Äù 

*Doot finds love?*

Finally, doot came to his senses and realized I wasn‚Äôt into him and wanted to find a partner for himself. I fully supported this, contrary to his belief (more on this later). I thought that if doot had found a gf our friendship could be like before, talks on Chinese history, shows, mental health, and self reflection. I really missed that. 

During this time I had been expected to ship out for army basic training and had little more than a couple of months before my ship out. Tensions started to arise when all Doot wanted to talk about was women he thought were attractive, not a problem until it gets to being 90% of the conversations. He‚Äôd show me pictures of women he found attractive on tinder that he hadn‚Äôt even matched with... and ask my opinion on them. Often I‚Äôd say ‚Äúyeah she‚Äôs cute!‚Äù But occasionally I‚Äôd say ‚Äúeh not really my type,‚Äù and he‚Äôd then go on and on trying to convince me of how hot the girl was to him. He‚Äôd also go on and on for hours about what he‚Äôd do to beep‚Äôs sister‚Äôs bhole. Yes, hours. It was just creepy, and annoying! I‚Äôd tell him this, but he‚Äôd just say I was jealous. I wasn‚Äôt in the slightest, I was creeped out and annoyed. There‚Äôs only so much one can hear about another someones butthole. (No he had never even seen it...) But then one day I had enough and I told him to stop sending me pictures of girls he hadn‚Äôt even matched with and just send me one he‚Äôs actually talking to, because I had enough of all the random pictures and all that nasty talk. He took offense from this, and took it as me belittling him, and basically pointing out the fact that he had never been in a relationship/struggled finding girls that‚Äôd talk to him romantically. I‚Äôll admit I could have said it nicer, but it‚Äôs the truth, it was creepy and he needed to stop that behavior. 

From this we stop talking for a while, and then I get a taunting message from him asking if I‚Äôve thought about how I‚Äôve acted. As if I‚Äôm some kid in trouble that must repent to mommy. This of course made me angry. And I asked him in return if he had done the same? 

Apparently not. 

Doot goes off on a rant over the course of a couple of days over messages which I am unable to respond to quickly as I‚Äôm working weekend double shifts in a healthcare job that doesn‚Äôt have much time for anything other than work... id be lucky for a bathroom sometimes. He knew this, but continued on. Yes, I reminded him. When I‚Äôd get home I‚Äôd shower and pass out within minutes. This seemed to infuriate Doot that I wasn‚Äôt available to him. Eventually Doot decided he was done sent me a message saying he was done with me, which I replied to without a fight and wished him well. I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to explain my side.  

*a lot of stuff I forgot to mention* 

HE WAS AN ONLINE FRIEND, caps because wow I should have mentioned that ages ago I guess. 

I almost forgot to mention he‚Äôd tell me stuff I DID NOT WANT TO HEAR about his sexual desires/kinks and his experiences with self pleasure and toys... when I‚Äôd get uncomfortable I‚Äôd say, ‚Äúokay stop..‚Äù and he‚Äôd just laugh and go on and on until he got out what he wanted me to hear whether I liked it or not. 

Multiple people got creeped out by him. Four  people I knew closely were very uncomfortable with how he talked about me in front of them. Anytime I tried to ask him to not talk about me that way at least not in front of other people he‚Äôd just call my other friends derogatory names. 

Doot would make me feel bad for not being with him and say things like ‚Äúafter all that I‚Äôve done for you‚Äù in fights when I was getting mad at him for not respecting my boundaries. 

More details: Doot would talk sexually about me and random women while he was on speaker phone around my mom who was working from home- yes her coworkers could potentially hear his comments.. (I live in a small apartment, and my mom would walk and talk on the phone up and down the halls and she could defiantly hear us as I could easily hear her)

I‚Äôd get angry at him for this after I had warned him multiple times that he‚Äôs on speaker and my mom could hear him.. his response, ‚Äúyou know better than to put me on speaker!‚Äù I guess it‚Äôs my fault he can‚Äôt have a normal conversation anymore??

He keeps trying to contact me and still places blame on me in his messages. 

He‚Äôs posting in my local nsfw (that he knows I view) even though he lives across the world. 

Sorry all the errors in my writing, I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted and basically just venting.... (and a terrible writer lol)

I've been saving myself all this time because I believed that somehow, somewhere, there was someone out there doing the same for me. Someone with an ideal they were willing to demonstrably strive for; a part of themselves they held-firm for that one special person. Not because it was ordained by any external creed, internal insecurity, or lack of alternative, but because it was their informed-choice to do so; their way of demonstrating that future devotion. I still believe in such a person.

Yet, there are days in which I reminisce what ""friends"" would tell me. With their judgemental looks plastered on their faces and stories of fun times they've had with their partners, I can't help but feel so...*alone*. Naturally, my constant moving has made me miss out on any romantic possibility, and I often wonder--would I really end up meeting the one? 

I'm just here to see if there is some sort of community for people like me or others who might feel the same way I do.

2824,ccwandco,1585818729,1,"I‚Äôm so desperate for love and human contact right now. And no, this isn‚Äôt just because of the coronavirus, though I suppose that may have amplified it a little bit.

For context when I refer to ‚Äúlove‚Äù I don‚Äôt specifically mean romantic love. I mean all kinds.

I don‚Äôt think I have ever truly felt love towards anybody, not even my family, even though they‚Äôre good people. I‚Äôve had many friends but I don‚Äôt think I ever loved them. Everything positive I‚Äôve ever felt towards the people I surround myself with feels more like an appreciation for things they‚Äôve done for me, or just in general thinking they are a fun person.

I‚Äôve also struggled with depression for a long time and finally got on some medication for it at the very beginning of the year. It has helped with my general sense of self. Basically I don‚Äôt hate myself anymore. Or at least it doesn‚Äôt feel like I do.

However, being able to spend less time focusing on myself has heightened my awareness of just how fucking lonely I am. I‚Äôm incredibly touch starved and just overall I feel like I have nobody to talk to about anything.

But here‚Äôs the issue. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve never, ever had that someone to talk to in my life. I have, a couple of times. But every single person that has been there for me emotionally I have pushed away. I start to resent them for trying to help me, even to the point of hating them, even though they literally have done nothing wrong and have actually been there for me. This has happened with my mother and former best friend.

The most recent experience I had with this was a friend I made during the first semester of my college year. She was basically my only friend until I later found another group to hang out with. I ended up introducing her to that group and we all hung out together. Her and I got really close though, and the closer we got, the more I started to hate her. It got to the point where I would flat out ignore her and give her dirty looks. I think I really hurt her feelings, considering that she later admitted she had a crush on me. Somewhere in the back of my mind I think I could tell and that‚Äôs why I pushed her away. We‚Äôve talked about it and have resolved the conflict, but we don‚Äôt even talk anymore and things will never be the same between us.

I just don‚Äôt know why this happens to me. I want to be loved and to love so bad, but every time I see it coming I start to freak out. It‚Äôs 100% the reason why I‚Äôve never kissed anyone or been in a relationship. Because everybody knows I don‚Äôt want it. But somehow I still do.

It‚Äôs been like this for a long time. When I was 13-14-15 I told everyone I was asexual even though I really wasn‚Äôt simply because I didn‚Äôt want anybody trying to flirt with me or get with me. And it worked. I later admitted to myself that I was just in denial of my true sexuality and needed to stop being so afraid.

But I‚Äôm still afraid. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me and why I‚Äôm so scared of love. I don‚Äôt even have any trauma I could draw from that would explain this. Does anybody here feel the same or have any advice?",lonely,I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me,2020-04-02 20:12:09

I live in Ireland,age 28m, and the only social life here is the pubs (closed due to corona-lockdown). That does not interest me. there's only so much drinking one can do before you get fed up with it and I think we can all agree alcohol doesn't bring the best out in most people. 

I'm out of a long term relationship 2 years now and have been actively avoiding new connections. So I'm reaching out now I guess.

2852,CrusaderKingsNut,1585798498,1,"I have Aspergers, depression, anxiety and a few other weird disorders that means I‚Äôm both dependent on social contact and I‚Äôm also super self conscious about that contact. A little over a year ago I came out to myself as trans, and now that I‚Äôm trapped in my house I‚Äôve been feeling more alone than ever. I‚Äôm trapped with my dad at the moment, and we have had a good relationship. My family is mostly pretty conservative, but my dad had always taught me empathy and to respect others. My grandparents hate him for it, but I always respected the fact that he went out of his way to try and keep me away from the more judgmental kinda mindsets my more conservative relatives believe. Anyways, he caught me in a skirt the other day and I took the opportunity to come out to him.

I had thought if anyone in my family would take it well, or understand it would be my dad. However, he sat me down and told me how I can‚Äôt know and that I‚Äôm just a gay guy probably into cross dressing. I know a lot of people are rejected way worse, but I think it‚Äôs okay for me to feel a little hurt. My dad was the one I thought would‚Äôve gotten it, and I wanted his support, but now he‚Äôs been distant. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs being an asshole, but he‚Äôs been avoiding me. 

I have a small group of friends I‚Äôm close with including one I‚Äôm super close with. I love him to death, just a wonderful friend who I think the world of, but he‚Äôs also gotten distant. Maybe he‚Äôs annoyed cause I‚Äôve gotten needy, but whatever it is I don‚Äôt blame him. I can‚Äôt help but notice however how he‚Äôll talk to people on group chats for hours and respond at the first mention of his name, but just take forever to respond to me. I know it‚Äôs selfish, he doesn‚Äôt owe me his time, I guess it just elevates my existing loneliness.  It‚Äôs not his fault, I shouldn‚Äôt be putting my need for contact onto him, but it‚Äôs one of those things I know abstractly but haven‚Äôt internalized. It‚Äôs not his fault, I just feel like everyone else is handling quarantine better than me and no one else has the energy to deal with my bullshit.

I guess the reason I wanted to type this out is just to have this written out. My dad has been super passive aggressive with me, but he also refuses to reference the problem between us. I can‚Äôt deal with him, because when I do I just get angry cause he was supposed to be the person who understood. Then I just feel everyone else is handling it better than me and they don‚Äôt have the time to be there and so I feel so alone. It‚Äôs not my friends fault, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad person for wishing I had someone who could be there to talk to. I just feel so alone.",lonely,I feel so alone,2020-04-02 14:34:58

2854,hamartiated,1585797891,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27 [M4F] - Looking for someone, who prefers regular audio conversations - Arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-04-02 14:24:51

In the last nights I've been sitting awake fantasizing how it would be to hang out with people I know and make casual conversation inside my mind (you know, the usual). But I've noticed today that I don't feel negative emotions while it's happening, like no sadness, frustration, I don't feel like it's bothering me as much as it used to. But the fact is that I spent have the night thinking about it, so even if my conscious won't admit it I can tell that in my subconscious I really need human contact. 

I'm also in coreantin which doesn't help.

I'm just afraid tbh. For a while now I had trouble connecting to the people around me, and I guess it will get better but the feeling of powerlessnes is so fucking anointing, that for this time, there is nothing I can do  to help myself.

i went into a cycle that i think he wants to be in my life and he promises to call me tomorrow and he never does, then i bawl up all my emotions and go into a really bad meltdown. at some point i decided he just doesnt care about me and if he does then he wouldve remembered those 100 times he promised to call me back or text me back. since then i just havent been able to connect with people the way i want to. i cant trust them with my feelings, i cant trust them with my thoughts- anything. 

because of my father i have ptsd. i cant sleep, loud noises make me go into an anxiety attack, all of the above. because of my ptsd i lash out, ive never used it as an excuse til this moment. i apologize right after because i realize my mistakes and sincerely didnt mean it. my girlfriend thinks i want to break up with her because i have trouble trusting her. in my mind i have every right to not trust her. shes gone behind my back multiple times to smoke when i told her if she continues smoking i will break up with her when shes promised me countless times shell stop. i dont believe her when she tells me she loves me and im scared to tell my thoughts in fear shell laugh and tell me theyre stupid.

i feel so by myself. she says that i can trust her, that she trust me so why cant i do the same with her. she says she tells me everything so i should do the same. my mother isnt any help with my problems with loneliness. instead of finding the source shell find alternative ways to fix the problem. shell go onto facebook groups and say that i like need to get out the house or smth. she says my problems are in my head and if i wanted  to get rid of the thoughts i just do it, she said im not working hard enough to fix them.

2889,two_men_duh,1585780510,1,"I've studied in 10 schools. Lived in 20 houses, divided among 4 different cities, one of them in a different state altogether. 

I'm a 22 years old woman.

My family is not close. My father has another family now and just doesn't have the time anymore. My mother was a monster to us and even the thought of aproaching her is usually enough for me to get afraid for myself. My older younger sister (does this work in English?...) lives in another city, we see each other once a year and rarely talk. My younger younger sister still lives with my mother in even ANOTHER city that I am still to visit. My younger brother is five and lives with my father in the city I was born.

I have one long time friend. We've known each other for 9 years. The last time we saw each other was in... idk 2016? But we sometimes talk through the web. I also have another two friends who are not that close but whom I've known for also 9 and 8 years. I almost never talk to them. These are the ones who know me for the most time.

I learned very early in life that friendships last little time, vanish fast and are replaced even faster and that never really bothered me. I used to change my persona each new school, for example, just because. I was not afraid to change houses or schools, and never really felt sad for leaving everyone I knew in those places. I would never really talk about me because it didn't matter, everybody was going to go away, as they did.

In spite of that, I didn't like to be alone. I always looked for someone who seemed like would like me and that would be my best friend for the next one or two years until I moved again. I rarely really liked them. I would be what I needed to be so I wasn't alone. Sometimes, it was a relief to change best friends, because I just couldn't take them. Also, I never made any efforts to keep in touch with those friends, as seemed natural for me.

Now I'm an adult. I've lived by myself for five years now and moved six times since then. I'm in college, and the UNTHINKABLE has happened. I made very good, fantastic, absolutely indiscrabable, precious friends who think like me, know me as nobody would EVER know when I was a kid and STILL, still like me for who I am. I just can't tell you guys how that feels. It's just like I died and am in heaven, or like God had mercy of me for once and gave me some angel friends for a while... yes, for a while... they are already fading out...

College is almost over. They are going back to their cities. We are not gonna talk. And I feel like I'm about to lose the most precious gifts I've ever earned, my treasures. I'm preparing to be all alone again, and that feels like I'm just getting ready to take my heart out and throw it in a shredder.

I know that's what's going to happen. I won't ask you to teach me how you guys keep long time friendships, because I think I know what I should do, I just... can't. Because I never did and it is extremely hard.

I just felt like sharing this.

I don't have anyone to hear. I don't want to look needy. I just love them so much. I feels so weird to care this much. I just wish things could be different.

I have really big anxiety. I can't build any trust and because of that I feel really lonely. I'm really introverted and don't really like it when I'm around people a long time. But with this whole situation with covid-19 I'm lonelier than ever. I just ended my friendship with my best friend because she was only using my and it damaged my trust in people even more. I have the feeling that nobody wants anything to do with me. Everyone is avoiding me because I radiate this dark feelings. 
I usually don't tell people what's wrong with me because in my head a voice always says: ""telling anyone what's wrong will result in more pain"". I created this rules and walls over the past 12 years. Everytime someone hurt me a sertain way I created a rule that this wouldn't happen again. 12 years ago my father died. I'm in such great fear of forgetting him that I keep as much as possible what my father owned. 
I'm trying to keep myself distracted as much as possible. The only way that works is with Netflix or YouTube. I pretend to be a part of whatever I'm watching... 
Today was a very bad day for me. I didn't get accepted into my dream job. I'm standing here and I'm looking into this dark future. I don't know what I want to do when I finish school. Every friend of mine has a plan, is happy and I living their life like they don't see the bad parts. I only see the bad parts... I only see the worst case scenario in everything. 
When I have no energy to do anything I usually withdraw myself from everyone and everything. This is another rule I set for myself. ""Don't do something when you got no energy. You could make a mistake and reveal to much of you"".
Not even my closed friends know everything about me. Not even my family knows my struggle. 
I don't like it when rules get broken. Especially my rules. Rules are there to protect and define something... 
My rules and walls define me. 

Nobody wants to bring up that energy to try to break the walls I build around me because nobody could even like someone they don't know that much to even try. I'm basically to scared to show someone my real me because that would make me vulnerable.

My 3 siblings who are all 10+ years older than me, well, they have their own life. It doesnt help when im clearly an accident. My family doesnt really communicate a lot. Even if my family had a groupchat, you should see how empty it'd be. It's been long since my family had gone out together. My family is struggling financially now and its caused by how poor they handle their money. I was too young to understand but I know now. I worked a minimum wage job for the past few months trying to buy school necessities. My school laptop especially. Financially burdened to the point my parents borrowed from me 3k$. 
Family a side. My social life outside of my family doesnt help either. I have anxiety and im socially awkward so it suits me to be an introvert. Its really hard for me to make friends. I would ever say I only had 1 friend in primary school that I could talk to. I would always stick with him during lunch break even after we split class. I still contact him. He's my definition of a friend. Though, he doesnt understand me much, he is a great friend. 
In secondary school, things were different. I was more confident than I was in primary school. Puberty, I guess. I made much more ""friends"". Reason why I used quotation marks was because they barely understood me. I always felt left out. During sports class I would always get picked last even though I wouldnt say im physically unfit.
Apart from that. Me being socially awkward with girls really doesnt help. I can barely talk to girls without messing up. I just feel useless and helpless. Needless to say, I think some of them might think im gay just because I dont talk to them. 
And how did I cope with this? I masturbate a few times a day. And it's not something im proud of. I feel like the only thing that is keeping me alive and happy is doing this... I just feel happy that im able to fulfill my sexual desires online... really happy. Nothing can make me this happy really. I dont talk to anyone. I wake up, masturbate, shower, eat, play on my phone and sleep. It doesnt help when school hasnt started yet. 
After doing it many times, I mustve realised what im doing is wrong right? Its not like im locked up in my house not able to go out? Apparently my country isnt on lockdown yet so no. At this point, im addicted, I dont know if I should be thankful for my addiction. If I didnt have access, I think I would have been dead from loneliness long ago.

2912,Goorillamanorrr,1585760161,1,"Hey guys,

Maybe a little background story about me first. I‚Äôve been a lonewolf pretty much all my life. Between the ages of 13-24, I kept losing myself in games, books and shows. I‚Äôve been depressed since I was 12, because I came out to my Turkish parents as lesbian. They didn‚Äôt take it well. Because of that event my course of my life has changed for the worse. I kept searching for love in other people, so desperately, that I keep losing myself in another person that I don‚Äôt see the purpose in life anymore after the person has left. I keep going in circles. 

Last month, I finally decided to look for professional help again after my 27th birthday, because I keep self-sabotaging myself whenever I feel lonely, whether it be school, or anything else I was vert passionate about. The last time (and first) time I looked for help I was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder. It all made sense. 

But the reason I‚Äôm reaching out to the internet is because, all appointments with my psychiatrist are cancelled until corona measurements have ended. And I have never, ever felt this lonely, awful and depressed in my entire life. Maybe because we aren‚Äôt quarantained by choice this time. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm tired and I just lost a person during quarantaine that was really dear to me and she hasn‚Äôt given me any closure, which is fine. Because I‚Äôm done having my own feelings controlled by another person. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never be able to know how to be happy on my own because it‚Äôs been so long.

It's like chrysalis for a caterpillar going under metamorphosis, we need it, if we don't have it, we will get eaten by predators or something else, it's crucial for our survival.
For me atleast, I just have to be in my chrysalis until death frees me so I can fly free as a butterfly in the end. All I have to is, don't leave it, don't let other enter it, and so there'll be no new pain until death does me part. I'll be okay by myself, I still have few pieces of myself left with me, it's not worth it to gamble it all away. And people don't understand it, that's why they tell you to not do it, cause maybe they're birds or flies or some predators who doesn't understand the need to or they just wanna have a claw at you and when it goes wrong, they'll just stand there and say, how would I have known while you suffer. 
It's not for everyone, I'm not telling everyone to be lonely, I know not everyone is a caterpillar who had enough, some of you are different and have a different path. I'm just sharing what's mine.
It's not all dark and gloomy once I realised this. This is actually good for me. That's all I had to share, for some you who wanna be alone but struggling with it, here's a thought to exercise so it's easier to convince and strengthen yourself. Be like metapod my fellow caterpillars, your time and situation to be a butterfly might be different than mine and fly free in the clear sky while being alive.

2929,Zackpattrick,1585743495,1,"So I'm 20, I've been hurt mentally and physically so much that I have become too numb to feel pain anymore. Lately though there were instances where someone asked me to break my guard off and let off emotions to ease pain but it only increased pain and made me cry and hurt more. I've always agreed to the fact crying and feeling pain makes a man weaker and when i don't feel ot anymore it doesn't hurt. 

I'm just too alone in life with nobody to cry after me if I die which even my own abusive mother says which is quite true but I wanna be a superhero in real life more like a crime fighter though with no powers I wanna use my life to save a lot of people. I've also been betrayed a lot of times, met selfish people and yeah the world has a lot of selfish people but I wanna be a selfless man.

You know there are times after college, the money my mom gives to me at times to come back home after college, I donate it to the poor and needy on the streets to see them smile thinking this will get them through, most often I even end up donating my entire pocket money for a whole month for a good cause because I can't see people in pain being someone who has been in pain a lot in life I can just imagine what worse than me they could be suffering.

I don't go to work even when at times I feel like i should work for earning money but mom doesn't let me work but even if I somehow will, I'm sure she will take my whole money because she's a crazy lady as she has threatened me to who has always hurt me and abused me over the years and never liked me being happy or becoming successful in life even breaking my Electronic gadgets at times or making me go through extreme tortures by beating me or getting people to hurt me despite of me being her own child she treats me badly even starving me at times. Though the torture has increased over the years my emotionless self has developed resistance towards every harm she does to me as I look at the sky always and believe that next year when I'll be eventually escaping and moving out, I'll save thousands of children suffering and also adopt kids who don't have parents and raise them as my own giving them all the happiness of their life that they wouldn't have gotten had they lived in orphanages or foster homes and treated the same way my own mother treated me and I wouldn't want that to happen for them and give them the best happiest life with all the happiness and no pain or atleast get them to safer homes.

I still have a year to finish college and leave this abusive place but even after I leave the home I wonder what kind of life will i live. I wanna be a superhero to fight crime because that makes me happy. I wanna being justice to the poor, expose the corrupt people and even if I die fighting for a good cause I'll still have no regrets because atleast I'll be putting my life to use for a good cause.

That's true people have not liked me over the years, nobody, also because of the way I look like which i have come to accept too that yeah I don't look like those good looking guys. So yeah even my love life is dry for which I don't have any regrets too as I have a lot of time and I wanna put my empty life to good use as well as yeah after I die nobody will cry for me that's great but me giving a lot of people who deserve a lot of happiness in their life who have the people they love with them, struggle with corrupted people or struggle with poverty etc will make me happy because atleast they have someone to live for but I have my own self to live for and What will I take to my grave after I die? No matter how rich I become I will only carry my body to the grave that's it while the worldly wealth wouldn't be of any use. 

I'm a spiritual guy and I wanna do good for the world as much as I can. I'm not a superhero, not a devil, not an angel but an ordinary guy who wants to be a secret crimefighter and social worker to do good to bring peace in this world.

You know one fine day when I'll die on the battlefield or on my bed I'll still smile knowing that I fought for the truth and what's right and layed my life down to save a lot of lives.",lonely,"20 M, Sometimes I feel like sacrificing my own life to save thousands of people suffering because I can't see people in pain and helping them makes me happy.",2020-04-01 23:18:15

! I AM ABOUT TO VENT! 

Okay if you're reading this, thank you, I need to get my feelings out. When I started high-school I was falling ill with an eating disorder. This is important because at the time I had extreme anxiety, which made me isolate myself from everyone, even my closest friends. In my second year of HS I got hospitalised for my eating disorder and I missed a year of school. This year I have returned and I'm a different person. I'm the old me. (the old me is a bubbly and fun person and when I was in primary school I was fairly popular (not in a gross way I just had lots of friends)) And I really, really want to people to like me but I have been labeled as a 'weird kid' meaning that no one wants to be my friend so I am being excluded and in some cases bullied (which has been emotionally draining as everyone chooses the other side over me) I've tried everything to make myself more likeable, going as far as to join a high intensity and high commitment sport in an effort to make connections, and it hasn't worked. (I'm literally crying writing this lmao).

Does anyone else feel this way?? I feel so alone and I really want to fall back on my eating disorder to cope but I know that is a terrible idea as it's what got me here in the first place and it was just as bad (worse tbh) having anorexia.

Sometimes you can deal with it and then the next minute you're sad as shit with no hope. It's just all I'd need is a hug or something, ya know? Social Anxiety has well and truly destroyed me as a person and has taken my life. Any enjoyment I used to have has been taken from me and It's just so sad because I know there's so much to enjoy in life but, I can't go and get it because of my mental issue. You try and get help but all they do is diagnose you and drug you. I'm tired of living like this, I'm tired of living in a cell, locked by my own thoughts and feelings. It's made me a terrible person and such a mean and dark soul but, behind that I'm such a soft guy but, after not having love and just someone to lean back onto the feeling of love becomes completely alien to you. I don't even know what it's like to be truly loved, that feeling of LOVE is something I've never been able to experience because, I have been trapped in my house for the past 4-5 years and I'm only 16. I'm not even able to enjoy doing things that normal teenagers do and I've forced myself to grow up and it makes you wanna just end it. I love everyone deep down but, my issues just make me seem like I wanna be an aggressive little asshole. People who are upset and vent out at people calling them the worst things and trying to make them sad is pure projection and it's a way of earning attention. When you're so lonely for so long and you become deprived of just a hug or a hello it turns you into a sour person and you'll do anything to get a bit of attention. Sometimes you do wanna just fly above the sky and break free you know what I mean? Sometimes life is a bitch but, there's life being a bitch and then there's life being a stone cold bitch for years on end. I wouldn't wish this feeling on my worst enemy. It's hard to even sleep at times because you know that when you wake up it's just the same cycle. You wake up, do nothing for most of the day and then sleep. But, I don't want that, I wanna escape, go to a mountain and just scream because I've piled everything on top of each other for AGES and after a while you can only hold so much before it bursts out. I know that people become lonely after a break-up but, I can't relate at all as I said before I've never even felt love, I've definitely liked a girl but never got anywhere with it.

**Message me to join our secret mastermind group**

Hey guys,

We have a special post today, we are about to hit 1k, and I thought I should do something different for today, its shorter essay on how to **seize the day** even under harsh circumstances. Notice the title says, ""Advanced"" therefore if you are new to self-help and self-improvement, you **might have a hard time thinking this way**. I recommend you take precautions and try best to endure. However, for a small group of us who have *reached higher levels of understanding, we can tackle this adversity differently.*

**1- You have a strong internal locus of control**

Psychologists explain that you have an internal locus of control is when **you are in control of your life.** Meanwhile, if you have an external locus of control, you believe that anything wrong that **happens to you can be attributed to factors outside of your control.**

If you are in the former group, you can focus on the how-to best tackle the situation at hand. Get it down and then focus on how you *can make the best of the situation*. However, if you have an external locus of control, you might have a meltdown and start panicking. It's fascinating that it didn't make out any of this. Instead, I'm seeing how different groups of people are dealing with the situation at hand. While some can make the necessary precautions and focus on their goals, others letting the case break them down.

**2- During this downtime you can start valuing what matters to you**

Hopefully, by now you this situation serves as a **wake-up call** for some of you. You now know that life and time are finite, and they **can end at the drop of a hat.** If you have been living your life as a cog in the machine, you can unplug yourself and genuinely have this time to *rethink your life decisions.*

If you have been living your life scared or worried over the most mundane things like handing in homework late or arguing with your superiors, then now it's the time to stop that! **It's time for you to appreciate the life you have as a unique gift.**

**3- An Optimist sees the opportunity**

I've seen cynism taking advantage of people during these hard times. For instance, people who would use price gauging to charge others for essential items, a morally reprehensible behavior.

However, in your case, you can use this time to finally do an online job that you've wanted to do for a long time. Or to start a small online business. **Now that you see the flimsiness of life, you can begin to be daring and taking the risk** since there's nothing to fear.

**4- You can use this time to pursue your goals aggressively**

While some acquaintances of mine were panicking, those who I admired made **the most out of the situation**. For instance, this LA singer who I like started doing challenges for her fans and took this stay at home time to connect better with her fanbase. Meanwhile, a friend who is a fashion designer has taken this time off to produce more content. At this stage, he can create one video a day, which will help him exponentially grow his brand.

This experience has taught me a life lesson. While we are all going through the same situation, some of us deal with it radically different. On the one hand, we have entrepreneurs and hustlers **who find creative ways to keep on thriving.** Meanwhile, we have others who easily crumble under pressure. Now, I'm not talking about first responders who are admirable. **I'm talking about those people who find ways to make a problematic situation worst for themselves and others**.

**Conclusion**

Anyway, guys, I thought I'd share that life lesson since I see it all around. **It's undeniable. This situation is serious, and your main priority is to keep yourself and your family safe.** However, it's also essential to try and **make the best out of any bad situation we have**. It also invites us to **a broader reflection**. Sometimes some of you ask me, ""If my parents were rich, my life would have been different"" or ""If the people at my high school were good, I would have had an incredible social life."" How can we see that different groups of people are dealing with the same cards, yet some see it as a catastrophe others see its ways to overcome it?

Some questions to reflect on:

2970,_Nandakoitsu_,1585709829,1,"So I know that with what's going on in the world right now its hard to meet people in real life. That doesn't change much as I was never the type to go around meeting people in real life. The truth is I'm quite introverted and I prefer to meet people only because then we really do have a common ground like video games and stuff like that.

The trouble is, every time I think about meeting new people by putting some sort of bio in a discord server for example, or finding someone with a good bio and reaching out, I just can't help but think that its gonna turn out bad. Either I and the person don't get along, which is fine because then we go our separate ways so that's actually good, or I click with someone and we talk and then I'm always the one messaging first or they never message or they are busy or they just then throw you away.

I don't understand why everybody treats meeting people as some sort of card game where they can throw away the bad ones that they don't want once they find better ones. I just wanna meet people and have friends but I'm convinced everyone is out to get me and that it will all just flop or come to an end.

I guess I could tell a little about myself..
I enjoy gaming (ps4 mainly), I enjoy watching movies, but I don't really enjoy it when I watch alone because I have no one to discuss the movie with. It's the same with watching videos on youtube. I have started getting back into ERBs (if you know you know). I enjoy listening to music. My playlist is all over the place, so I basically will listen to anything. 
I am open minded. I will talk about anything. Puns. Jokes. Conspiracies. ANYTHING! (As long as you don't get offended easily) 
Here is where I believe people will be turned away. I do make tiktoks out of boredom, and yes they are cringy but tiktok itself is cringy. 

So basically if you want an open minded, lonely, socially awkward friend.. message me. I'll talk to anyone. Any age. You could be male, female, alien, or zombie, and I will still find a way to talk to you!

Well I fell in love really hard for this middle aged Turkish man that I met in at a construction site where I worked, and I was totally blown and in awe when I first made an eye contact with him. For a few seconds I couldn't take my eyes off of him because it was nothing like I had ever seen before. He had blueish grey eyes and a full beard with grey patches under both corners of his lower lip down to his chin. His hair was short, slightly curly, with a salt and pepper color. He was the most handsome man I had ever seen.I was 19 and he was 51 years old and apparently old enough to be my father but he was def my daddy tho...... Fuck me. Strangest &amp; hardest I have ever fallen for someone. Let's be real here, I am perfectly aware that it is out of  possibility. I know it's a very uncommon and unusual case, and to some extent maybe inappropriate. Fast forwards even after 5 months I'm still madly in love with him and still think about him every single day. Never the less, it doesn't make my suffering less significant just as some of you out there may feel the same way for someone. Now that the job laid off everyone because of this pandemic, I will never be able to see him again for the rest of my life. Somehow strangely relieving, yet passively painful like a chronic disease that will always find a way to latch onto you for a long time.

Donald Kaufman: Oh, God. I was so in love with her.

Donald Kaufman: I remember that.

Charlie Kaufman: Then, when you walked away, she started making fun of you with Kim Canetti. And it was like they were laughing at me. You didn't know at all. You seemed so happy.

Donald Kaufman: I knew. I heard them.

Charlie Kaufman: How come you looked so happy?

Donald Kaufman: I loved Sarah, Charles. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want.

Charlie Kaufman: But she thought you were pathetic.

Donald Kaufman: That was her business, not mine. You are what you love, not what loves you. That's what I decided a long time ago.

The only social interactions I had with other people was at school but now I'm in lockdown, I have nobody. I do speak to one guy online (discord) who I'm great friends with but he's not usually online.

I'm bored. I honestly do school work all day, from when I wake up and throught out the day - when I become too tired and go to bed...

I'm unhappy. I can't describe how I feel. It's just a feeling of nothingness. Just - no joy, nothing. I feel down all the time - there are some rare moments when I laugh...

Finally... I feel like I'm a terrible person. I've not killed anyone, I've not hurt anyone, I've not comitted a crime. Things I've said to people in the past, people I've pushed away - I look back on it now, regretting everything. I regret my entire childhood. I only focused on work. I never had fun. I never had a childhood. Never invited to a party, never had a first kiss, never been in a relationship. I spoke to my crush over insagram and told her my feelings - she said ""that's so sweet, thank you"" and that's it. I'll never see her again - we're going to different schools.

I have an urge to hug someone but nobody to hug. Sure, my parents are there for me but that's all...

Also - I don't remember the last time I cried. I think I'm physically incapable... No matter what the situation is, even when a loved one passes away - I show no emotion. What's wrong with me?",lonely,Alone. Unhappy. Bored. In lockdwown. I always feel like I'm a terrible person.,2020-04-01 08:01:46

3004,c1m9h97,1585680848,1,"Prior to the pandemic, I had a decently active social life and was beginning to form and strengthen friendships. However, since the pandemic arose, I find this time of social distancing especially difficult because I live completely alone. I am finding myself super jealous of people with roommates or living with a loving partner, and despite my confidence, focus on my career, and independence I don‚Äôt have either. It is possible to be a very self-loving person but not draw people in, and as an extrovert, I find it unbelievably depressing to be spending this much time alone. I am complete without anyone else, but it is human to desire companionship, both platonic and romantic.
I do put things into perspective. I am aware that there are plenty of people stuck with an abusive person and that is truly horrifying and I wish I could do something to stop that for others. Having toxic relatives, I am grateful not to be around others who bring me down and/or treat me poorly. I also am very grateful to have a stable, meaningful career job, and therefore, a steady income. I have my health, which is perhaps the most important thing. I try my best to focus on all of this.
But I‚Äôm very sad and this is really getting to me. People who are quarantined with good, friendly, healthy people (in whatever capacity, including a kind roommate) are super lucky.

3006,radnuggets,1585677432,1,"This is just a rant of my random thoughts. I dunno. I don‚Äôt have anyone to say it to. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt okay. 

Any amount of niceness from anyone results in attachment that I know isn‚Äôt mutual, and it hurts. 

Talking to someone and seeing them actively ignore things you‚Äôre saying, only even pretending to listen because they feel bad.. that fucking sucks. It‚Äôs more upsetting than just completely being ignored.

I‚Äôm still coming to terms with the fact that I am disabled. I‚Äôve talked with my therapist about the obvious ‚Äî money problems, not being able to do things I used to do. Stuff like that. But I haven‚Äôt (because it‚Äôs embarrassing) mentioned how much more lonely it‚Äôs made me feel. It‚Äôs not like I would go out and try to meet people before, but now I don‚Äôt even have the option. I can‚Äôt go out. I feel like it was just the final nail in the coffin of potentially finding someone to care about me

I‚Äôve been struggling a lot lately. Relapsing with self harm and my eating disorder. More scars and being fatter just makes me even more unlovable. My therapist likes to say ‚ÄúWhy does it matter what you look like? You don‚Äôt go out, nobody even sees you‚Äù, and I get that she‚Äôs just trying to get me to stop worrying about other people and work on self love, but it just makes me feel like shit.

I hate everything about myself. I know it‚Äôs a common saying that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else.. if that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm going to die alone.

I‚Äôve been in two relationships before, but both were extremely abusive and left me with lots of trauma. I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like to be with someone that isn‚Äôt abusive like they were.

It always makes me upset when internet strangers say they care about you.. you don‚Äôt know me, you can‚Äôt possibly care about me.

3011,seadork,1585675689,2,"I don't have any childhood friends. Any close friend I've ever had has left my life after a couple of years. I have plenty of friends now as an adult but they're all surface level and I'm afraid to get close to any of them because everyone I get close to leaves. 

The pattern seems to be that I hit it off with a friend, they come to me with their problems and I listen. Then if I reach out with my problems, I either get steamrolled, (Usually a quick, ""that sucks"" before changing the conversation to a problem they're having without asking me if I'm okay, if I wanna talk about it, etc) they help me talk through the problem but start reaching out to me less and less, or they tell me I'm overwhelming them with my problems and cut ties completely. 

I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD from familial abuse so I know my problems can be heavy. I go to therapy and I really try to be mindful about not sharing anything that could be better handled by a mental health professional. But no matter what, confiding in people seems to be what kills my relationships. 

It's not even like my friendships are all just about venting. I like to have fun and go out and just talk about silly things with people. But to me, the level of trust and intimacy to be able to reach out for a shoulder to lean on is crucial to have a close friendship and I just can't seem to get that right.

I was extremely happy at first, since I could now quit my job and finally focus on something that I enjoy doing. But suddenly, for no reason, it hit me. This shitty empty feeling inside of me was there again. And it's making me angry, sad, and frustrated at the same time. Because I'm supposed to be happy. 

But I just feel lonely. All my friends are gone. I don't have any friends anymore. Not in real life, and not even online. And I'm still young. I'm turning 17 in a few months. So I don't think that I should already be feeling like this. It just started with not having friends after I finished school. And to this day I don't understand why people just decided to simply not care anymore. It's not that hard to stay in touch these days. But they simply didn't care. I tried to also not care. ""This is fine, I enjoy being alone."" And I did. I could always be myself when I'm alone. I still had some friends online too, so I wasn't completely lonely. But they also decided to not care anymore. And to simply cut me off. Because it's easier to do that instead of staying in touch. So now I was completely lonely. My daily routine changed. Instead of being with friends or talking to them (doesn't matter if irl or just chatting online), I now had to find ways to waste my time. Listening to music, playing videogames, drawing, watching Youtube, looking at memes. The usual stuff. But the usual stuff now sucked. It's not the same anymore. Because I feel empty. Because I miss my friends. And I hate being lonely. I want to be with people so badly. I sometimes find myself scrolling through old messages. And I miss those times. Because I wasn't lonely back then.

I also want to be loved. Saying that I just want a girlfriend seems dull. That's not it. I want someone who can fill this empty feeling in my head and stomache. But not just a friend. A person who is special to me, and vice versa. Someone who I can trust and build a deep, romantic connection to. Someone who is always there for me, and someone who I can be there for.

Typing my thoughts out makes me feel pathetic. It's hard to talk about this mess, which is one of the reasons why I keep all of this inside of me instead.
