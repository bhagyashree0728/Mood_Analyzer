4,Ruunatik,1601462454,1,"Not sure if this belong here, but I just want to express this out because it just getting on my nerve. Sorry for the long post.

So, the problem is that I just can't stop myself from accidentally making others around me angry at me. Back in High School, I didn't feels this problem as big as I currently feels. I was quite a quiet guy, sitting alone while getting bullied everyday with bad social skill. I just thought that it not going to affect my life. But ever since I started my college life, I had a lot of new friends and they are good to me. Things had been good to me for years, and I thought that this problem that I used to had were just a very minor things now, since I sometimes makes them angry at me and they not that mad at me. It become more clear that this problem is far worse than I thought when I had this junior from my major that had confessed that she liked me. It was like something that I never dream of since I keep telling myself that no one would ever like me, and I had interested her for a while . So I tried my best to not screw up, tried to be optimistic, tried to be a good guy, I even confess to her back because she had great personality. But in the end, that problem had come back. I started to made lots of mistake and it keep offending her, and making her sad after we been talking for like 2.5 months. It keep getting worse to the point that she already stop the flirty talk with me, because she not sure whether she still like me like she used to or not. With recently,  I had accidentally made her mad at me twice in 2 weeks. While my friends aren't react as strong as my crush does, they still being mad at what I said regardless.

After I had times to digest my mistakes that I did to my crush, I feels even worse because I can't stop thinking about similar mistakes that I made ever since Middle School, about friends that I used to talked with who stop talking to me because of what I did or said and about people that I had angered.

Its just like something that I can't get rid off. No matters how much I being cautious not to make them angry, I still ended up angry them with my words choices, one way or the other. All I could is to tell them that I'm sorry for making you angry. I didn't know that the words that I said are offensive, I didn't know that the way I said can be interpret into something that offend them. Sometimes its just me being rude without realising that the way I speak or behave was rude. Some people believe that I just said sorry to make up for that and continue to being rude. The more I made mistakes, the more I become stressful and depress. The more I depress, the more mistake I made. And the loop continue. This things just leads me to other problems like mood swing, anxiety, overthinking. It just made me feels lonely, that I failed to be good human being. I didn't want to lose them as my friends, but I just keep making them feels angry at me anyhow. As for my crush, I still like her even with what she said at me when she mad. I just don't want to keep anger her like this, every times I made her angry, I just feels really depress for what I did.

I just want to stop being like this, some of my friends tell me that I don't think at all before said something, some says that I just can't read the atmosphere of people (what are they currently feeling, what is their emotions, etc.). Currently, my friends and my crush acknowledge my problem. They mad when I make them angry, but they still forgive me for that. But I just don't want it to continue like this, because I didn't know just how long before they all lose their patients.",lonely,I feels bad about myself keep making mistakes,2020-09-30 20:40:54

I started talking to one of my classmates from senior year a while ago. We never really talked in school so it was a surprise. And we really resonated with each other. To the point we would talk till 5 in the morning. I started liking her and told her about it. She didn’t think of me as anything more than a friend. Rejected. Every time. I’ve been craving love all my life. Intimacy. Touches of affection. Anything I ever hug or cuddle with is my pillow. And that’s just the physical aspect. I need someone who understands me.

I'm a photo bug. Been constantly snapping pictures everywhere I go with my phone(s) for as long as I can remember. Friends, places, love interests, whatever. Some get deleted cuz they're meh quality, or maybe you want to rid your brain of the memories attached to that particular picture. I usually refrain from doing so cuz I feel each picture tells a story of a moment in time that'll NEVER be captured again.

I've hung onto a good many over the years and sometimes I like to sit with some music on that's relative to the time they were taken, and just relive everything again. Looking at each photo and remembering where I was, who I was with, or what we were doing that day. Tonight I'm looking at ones of my baby brother and I. We just lost him last month to an overdose and man, do I miss that fuckin dude. We had 6 years between us so we weren't as close as most siblings but we still loved each other with everything we had.

You never stop to think about life without certain folks. It's ingrained into your brain that they'll be around forever. You're gonna have each other when your parents finally pass. When you retire you'll have more time for bonding via fishing/road trips. Now though...I can't look forward to any of that stuff. Our best years are behind me and all I can do is try and keep his memory alive for his daughter and everyone else whose life he touched.

If you've made it this far, please do us all a favor and help anyone you may know that's struggling with addiction and/or mental illness.

45,Worldwidearmies,1601414192,1,"This is kind of a r/lonely, r/offmychest, r/TIFU and r/irony story in one, so here it goes...
So since about 4 years I've been feeling lonely. Not particularly alone - I always manage to get some people around me - but lonely, where no one ever invites me to stuff, genuinely asks how I'm doing or simply cares...

Now, I have this friend. I've always had this weakspot for her. We were always close, but we already barely saw each other when we went to the same school, and now I moved away for college she lives 100 km away...we see each other once or twice a year (though we speak weekly).

Last weekend we hang out, and it became a late night. We both had a few drinks, and when she asked me genuinely how I was doing. Because I wasn't used to this, I got a bit emotional and suddenly (with some help of the beers) I told her everything. How I missed a best friend, someone to care etc etc... God I wish I didn't.

When we sat there she was very kind and supportive, but it didn't take long before I realised the effects.
See, when you tell someone you're lonely, two things will happen in my experience:
1. Whenever you ask that person to hang out or something, they'll feel obligated to say yes because they know how you'd feel if they said no. This could make them feel bad, since they either have to say yes when they don't actually want to / can, or they say no but might feel bad for thinking they hurt you. When I realised this, I didn't ask anymore because I didn't want her to feel bad.
2. Whenever that person now asks me to do something or how I am, I'll always suspect it's only because I told them I'm lonely. I don't want pity love, and want genuine love. But now, even if they do actually mean it, there will always be that voice inside my head saying ""it's just because she feels sorry for you"".

So yeah, TIFU and lost the one person who I had a special bond with, even if I rarely saw here, by telling her how I felt. The irony...",lonely,I told someone I feel lonely... Can't recommend it,2020-09-30 07:16:32

56,new_writer_,1601406298,1,"Numbness

Another day passed, another starless sky, another sunset, I used to enjoy these, what happened? Another song, another dark memory brought back, another lyric of a sorrowful song that isnt just part of a song but a tear that drips down my cheek as I recall it. Another friend who left, another who has newly came, another person that told me I mean nothing, what happened? Another kiss that had no meaning behind it, another love that must be put in quotes when mentioning it, another “love"" that hasn’t been heard from, why do I fall so easily?. 
I felt it, I felt the free fall of life, I’ve been falling for a while now, its beautiful, the ways it passes, yet its terrifying, you’re falling and there is nothing you can do about it, am I the only one that feels that way?. I havent been me ever since, I never feel enough, I never feel cared about, I never feel, Its like I’m numb, not to the pain of life but to watching it pass me by, can anyone else tell me that I matter and then prove otherwise with their words? Can anyone else make me think they like me?. Questions I wont find answers for but what do I do? How do I heal?, do I heal at all?.
I tried ending it all, I thought maybe that’s a way out, a way to face no more pain, a way to for the storm to end, but I learnt something, you see life is terrible, it hurts, it bruises, it scars you, it’s a storm, but no one has it good, I’ve had terrible things happen to me, things that wiped the smile from my face possibly forever, things that have made me incapable of showing emotion, but then I talked to people, I saw how a friend of mine had it worse, way worse, yet she was happy, she had- fun, a thing I knew nothing about, she was trying to stay happy and so she did, I learnt that life isnt about waiting for the storm to pass, it’s about learning to dance in the rain, how that may sound depressing but it’s not, it’s quite funny, I thought I must make it end, to get numb to it, to solve it all, to be good enough, to be perfect, to be happy, but it’s not that, you see being alive is different than living, I wrote a story once as a child, I read it yesterday, although it was terribly written it told me a story of a young girl, whom lived in a small house, had to make her own living and live by herself at a young ago, a struggle for a child of her age, yet she was happy, because she had a teddy bear which she loved a lot, which she kept by her side, and she enjoyed being by it no matter where or how, so that small house was a place of joy for her, her struggles, were mere less pleasant moments but still pleasant for she was with her toy, she was living, she didn’t care about how she was staying alive, she was living, I didn’t know how to use this story, would a person play that role for me?, would an activity?, would an object?, I didn’t know what was my teddy bear, until I ran, I ran, I didn’t feel well so I had my music and I ran, to the end of the road our house is in, I ran for an hour till I reached a hill, it was dawn, I sat by a rock and watched the sunset, I forgot who I was, what I was, what my life was and is, I forgot life, I then realized, I was living for a second, my music and my love for the sky is what makes me not numb but invincible to the pain, they’re different you see, numbness isnt a cure, but this, this- life, this- is, there is much to love and much to see in this world we live in not all of it is ruined.
I wrote this for whoever it may concern, for whoever feels like I did, for whoever who needs it, don’t go out asking for help from random people, even if you want help ask from those closest to you, whatever you do don’t fall in love hoping itll fix it, I tried it hurts more, for some this may not be the case but I found it to be the majority of what happens, find what you want to live for, and believe me I’ve been listening to music for 7 hours a day for the past year and I didn’t feel this, I’ve been watching the sky for years and I never felt this, It may be right in front of your eyes, yet the pain makes you blind to it, live it, live the moment, dance in the rain, enjoy it, there’s nothing more valuable than life, that’s why I’d never say I’d die for a person, if I love them that much, I’d live because of them, I’m not preaching, im telling you what I did, and asking you to try it, it may not work now but itll work someday, we all will have something to live for.

They see all these perfect people on Instagram that they feel like they are required to look and sound just like them. There’s nothing wrong with trying to look or sound nice, but it seems like that’s all people care about anymore. They want to look and talk like they’re all that but don’t have anything genuine or authentic about themselves. Whenever I try to have deep meaningful conversations with anyone, they don’t know how to respond because their so used to living life through the lens of some friend or celebrity figure they adore that never says or does anything wrong in the fake image he portrays in life and media. The feeling of being humbled or humanized is almost frightening or uncomfortable to them, so they leave you or the conversation to get back to living in their life of insecurity on the inside and perfection on the outside.

So many people are always trying to mimic their walk, talk, dress, and body of some celebrity or body builder. I can tell when talking to people like this that when they say something back, it’s almost as if it’s scripted or something, like they don’t know how to think for themselves. I feel like I’m they only one who sees this, or at least the only person who doesn’t make my image the sole purpose for which I live. Nothing wrong with giving your image a little care, but if I told the average person that I’ve have no Instagram, never even seen the inside of a gym, haven’t heard a single new song from the past 3 or so years, don’t even work out really except for maybe a run here and there. I feel like I’d probably get shunned by everyone, or hammered with insults.

In summary, people have lost the courage to admit what makes us really human. That even though at times we are great and can accomplish many things, we are also failures and embarrassments a lot of the time. But the media age we live in has shunned the idea that there is a vulnerable weak side to all of us. And because all people see are perfect portrayals people give themselves online, no one feels like they can connect on an emotional level with anyone anymore. And the only connections anymore are shallow and void of real relationship and serve only the purpose to magnify our self image.",lonely,Social media has ruined society.,2020-09-30 04:14:41

82,mofedstark,1601381659,1,"
I can't post this on my main reddit account for some reasons.

My parents are billionaires. My father is an investment banker. Most of his money comes from being the son of a real estate tycoon. My mother was born into an old-money family. I do not know for sure how much money they have since 1) I've never once asked and 2) Even if I did ask, I don't think they'd discuss that with me. But you don't need to know a number in order to know that you have access to more money than an average person will make in their lifetime.

What's it like to be a child with billionaire parents? Well, I certainly wanted for nothing. From the moment I was born, I was able to have nearly anything that I even thought of desiring. Whatever I wanted, I got. It was as simple as that. Want to get a car? Sure, I'll call the guy. I had my own American Express Centurion Credit Card (or as some people call it, a Black card). I could buy nearly anything I wanted without worrying or even glancing at the price tag. Looking back as an adult, it's actually kind of repulsive.

Growing up was kind of like a vacation. We traveled constantly. We flew in a private plane and would always stay in the best hotel suites. We had (and still have) 15 homes around the world, including a private island.

We have a full staff, including gardeners, maids, cooks, butlers, security, etc. and I do not remember a time when we did not. For the main part of my childhood, I was “raised” by these people. Like many other children of wealthy parents, I remember my childhood to be slightly lonely. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents. I'm not one of those rich kids who has a strained relationship with their parents. But my parents weren't around much. My father wouldn’t be home 3 weeks out of 4, and my mother would be going to her events. Minimal parenting with an unlimited amount of money at such a young age? There are only so many ways that could go.

Being the offspring of two billionaires is terrifying. It's utterly frightening. It’s not something people talk a lot about. All people seem to discuss when talking about being a billionaire are the privileges and the lifestyle and the excess and the fabulousness...but no one talks about the scary part of being a member of a rich family. But when you're in this position, it's real. It's really, really scary and it's always in the back of your mind. You’re always afraid of being kidnapped or killed or tortured or whatnot. It’s not paranoia, it’s the truth. It’s possible and it could happen at any time. I’ve always had a security team. Whenever I go out of the house, my security group follows. Public outings where there will be a lot of people are planned. I do not remember a time when I've not had a security entourage. In a way, I don't think I'll ever experience something as simple as going to the grocery store alone or enjoying a concert in the crowd like everybody else. Our homes are decked with state-of-the-art security devices. Seeing those complex security devices...in your house, in the room where you sleep, in the bathroom where you shower, reminds you that you live in danger. It's this constant reminder that you're DIFFERENT. It’s something that you have to live with, the idea that there might be people out there who want to hurt you because of how much money your parents have.

I was always sent to the best schools. Even if I didn't have the grades to get into a certain school, I'd get in, due to family connections or networking from my parents. That's something that I didn't understand when I was little. I'm not as smart as these kids, so why am I in the ""smart"" school? Well, it turns out that you don't actually belong here. You're not smart enough, so Mom and Dad used their connections! You took a spot from a kid who was smart enough and actually deserved it. Your parents have connections, otherwise you wouldn't be here! That's what it was like in school. All this money, all this stuff, it doesn't belong to you. It belongs to your parents. It was bought with THEIR money, and you're simply their child.

Being a child born into such extravagant wealth definitely puts a lot of pressure on succeeding. You are reminded constantly to NOT RUIN YOUR FAMILY'S REPUTATION. Also, anything that you succeed at goes back to your family, not you. You are constantly reminded how successful and great your parents are.Your parents did this! Your grandparents accomplished this! Now, what are YOU going to do? Is it going to be as great as what they did? You are raised with the highest of expectations.

Today, as a young adult, I'd like to think I'm out of that crazy tunnel. I make my own money, and I support myself financially. I suppose by definition, I'm still a billionaire. As for my parents, I know they'd always help me out financially if I were to ask them, and I am grateful for that.",lonely,What is it like to be the child of a billionaire?,2020-09-29 22:14:19

95,totalynotathrowavvay,1601362249,1,"So how do I start this? Guess exposition! (edit: can skip anything after the first 3 rows, mostly venting there)

I'm in my early 30s. Got my fair share of mental issues, but I'm good at hiding it. Did not have any real life friend/acquaintance in more of a decade and the last friend I had kinda kept me around as a last choice to come first choice to go/pet sort of thing. And before that had some even more one sided/toxic friendships (was not aware at the time, felt like the best friends in the whole wide world!). No job since 2015, just on and off working from home (online stuff). Never had a girlfriend or girl friend, irl or online. Had an online friend a long time ago, back in  highschool, but he changed for the worst overtime and eventually just broke ties with him. A few years later made 2 new online friends, met them in a game we all played. One of them did not click well, we had conflicting personalities, standards and expectations from each other, and yet we still managed to hang out and play games. The other, well, it's, from my experience, what I would call a best friend, always patient, non judgemental, open to debate, can talk with him about anything and everything, even something he does not agree with or is offended by he can still have a friendly relaxed debate. An amazing person! The kind of person that someone like me does not deserve. Always I felt deep down that I was a parasite and that I was waisting his time. That I was taking from our friendship farm more then I was giving. And as much as I wanted, did not have much to give... One day, about 3 years ago I opened up a bit about some of my mental issues and wish I did not. It felt like I have forcefully put some wait on his shoulders just cause I was carrying mine. Felt guilty and that I broke some unspoken of barrier that no one is supposed to break. I was afraid he was not gone see me as before, more like a broken person he has to be treated carefully. I was terrified that he was gona look down on me from then on or that he was not gone be himself around me. Nothing really changed with him thow, he was the same, witch was great. But now I opened Pandora's box. While I never spoke about my issues again, I started complaining about random small issues from my life, small thing that I was blowing out of proportion, stuff that while was bothering me I was fine with it since forever. I realised recently that was my subconscious way of letting steam out the sides to prevent the lid from blowing off. It's been almost a month now since he last answered, he's around daily, just ignoring me. I appologised about this many times before and he always said there's is nothing to apologise for As I said before, I kinda expected this sooner, no idea why he hanged out with me for so long. I should have walked away earlier, but I was selfish. That being said I don't feel quite well with the idea of making new friends, even worse with the idea of looking for a significant other.

/exposition

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said, the idea of being alone until the day I die sounds even worse. Being in a big community/group chat tends to feel even worse, it's odd, the more ppl I am around at a time, the more lonely I feel. Ideally a 2-3 group seems the lucky number. It's odd. So I started looking on all kind of subreddits (here, r4r, naf, gamerpals, friends only or dating subs mostly) a few months ago. Funny enough, while looking for ppl with common gaming interests (this seems like the easyest icebreaker/friendship starter and any other person I met online, was in some game), I found mostly females. I posted a few times, but got next to no answers, and when I did, it went nowhere, so I started reading through posts, a few hours every day and messaging at least 3-10 ppl every day. So by now, I contacted at least a thousand ppl! Most ppl never answer, some do, we add each other on discord, I try to start a conversation, feels Like I'm pulling teeth or dragging boulders uphill, some seem great, go straight to voice, eather the person talks non stop about some random stuff, or we have a decent conversation, and that's it, they never answer again, some say it's not what they were looking for, others wana keep it a ""text once a week"" sort of thing. And these are ppl with detailed, enthusiastic posts! Like wtf? From that to get to a convo where I get 3 word answers 1 hour late? How? Why? If there is something wrong or just not interested, or found someone else, or whatever, why not just say it! Why look for something if you are not interested in it?

And then there's the female side of it. Less then 1 in 10 answer (understandable, from what I talked with they get 20-50 messages when they post), most of them completely refuse voice chat or want a ""trial period"" of a few days or weeks before we can voice chat. What?!?! why make a post that says pretty much ""I'm bored, looking for someone to voice chat and/or play x, y or z game with"" If you found someone else, say so! Someone I kept being insitent with, said she did find someone but could not decide if they were entertaining enough so kept me ""on hold"". Well shit. So much time and effort and nothing to show for it at the end of the day. Why ppl put so much effort into a nice, detailed post and then be that way? Seems worse then a shitty job ad. Yea, I'm a bit of a bland and boring person and have not much to say and most ppl would probably not be ok with that, but I can't even get to the point when that becomes an issue. When I first got the motivation and courage to do this, I was prepared for a long term hard work task, but holy shit, this feels imposible!

I could keep going on, but what's the point, bottom line is I think this is the wrong approach, the wrong place or I'm doing it very very wrong. So now my question is: How do ppl make friends these days? Or find their significant other? Cause reddit or dating apps is deffenently not it, not for me at least. To be honest, I kinda gave up on it and accepted my fate. I'm not expecting much, but hey, u never know if u don't try, right? Plus I had to let some steam out about this before my head exploded.

109,Lucek_nyktofil,1601354779,1,"Hello, dear redditors. This is my first time doing such a thing because usually I don't trust people close to me, so it's much easier to vent to people on the internet. At the very start, I'd like to ask you to not write things like 'don't worry' or other similar things because it doesn't help at all.

I'm going to write from the heart, without any plan, so sorry for being chaotic. 

For starters, I've been told today that 'nothing will come from this, but you're a nice guy, we can be friends'. So yeaaaaaaah... I'm not a person who forces himself to be a nice guy just to gain someone's affection. Due to my beliefs about way of living and other life circumstances I've been through, it's just who I am. I'm mainy a nerd, so it's not that esy to find someone to connect to (I'm hetero 25M). And I also love cinematic music, classical, soundtrack but also... metal, mostly metal and especially black metal. Finding a person who likes both games and black metal feels like hitting a jackpot. Guess I've put expectations from the start when I met who I thought to be a soulmate, but she told me exactly what's in the beggining of this section.

I feel disappoonted. I've never had anyone in my life and I can't fulfil even such basic need as physical affection. Years of mental abuse made me dysthymic but I never made an attempt on my life. For years I've been carrying depression of my penpal as well, who attempted recently third time. Even with my nihilistic views, I'm an existencialist, I chose to be. Struggling every day to live but I live, trying to get my life together after years of neglect and lack of any guidance from close people.

- More on birthdays, I get calls from parents and my sibling. When they ask how I am going to spend the day, I say talking with friends - I am getting a lot of calls which is a complete lie. 

- Even more on birthdays, my best friend has forgotten my birthday for the past 2-3 years. 

- I try to be nice to people from my past even if they are mean to me because I want to have people to invite to my wedding (if that's going to ever happen). Honestly that's the only reason I claim to have a best friend. I used to have a lot in common with him but now I don't.

125,Dyslexicdruidofsanta,1601347520,1," This might be a cross post so forgive me for that because I guess Im looking for anyone who can give me advice. Im struggling with respecting a no and being bitter and resentful

I genuinely feel I do love my LO. But i also have struggled to respect her no before. Ive always respected her as a person and i know its her right to say no. But i got around blocks, made false accounts etc. 
I know i shouldnt have. But i always thought if she heard what i had to say, how i feel etc it would change her mind. I know its silly but it was almost like a puzzle where if i could combine the right words it would click.

Realistically i know why she doesnt want me. Not only the distance issue, but shes very fit and was a fitness competitor. Shes very driven and has right wing beliefs and values strength and stability. I get it. She dates very successful athletic men. Im depressed, nothing of value money wise to support a family and am fat. Depression really wrecked my body as much as my mind as food is a comfort. I will never be rich or have a good career at 37. Im left wing too. So i get it.

But it still hurts. She doesnt see me as a mate or potential. Because i know one rich douche she dated cheated on her and dumped her by text to go back to his ex he never got over.

I know ill never find someone as good as her. I aimed high and found an amazing woman who was top tier in every sense. However i myself am not top tier so i understand her not wanting me. It makes sense.

So why did i and do i struggle to accept no? I am trying to fix my life but even then im thinking about coming back to her once i do just to see if it changes her mind. I seem to need that or i give up. People say do it for myself but whats the point of getting fit and living longer to just spend more life alone? And i am bitter. I am generally not a fan of fit muscular guys anyway so the fact she likes them makes it worse.

I dont know what to do. I am respecting her wish to leave her be. But im struggling. And every single day before bed i pray to any god that might listen (tho i dont think there is one, not one who cares anyway) that i might die in my sleep.  A small part of me has hope life will be better so i dont think i will successfully kill myself...but a part of me just wants to be dead and gone and finished and at peace.

I have barely any friends who talk to me. I’m disgusting-looking, and so I’ve never had a girlfriend and that has completely ruined my life. It hurts beyond belief knowing a woman will never desire me or love me in any capacity. 

I’m a college graduate who can’t get a job; I wanted to teach at university, but can’t and will probably never happen because I’m too poor. I graduated in May with honors, got straight As, but nevet got accepted into any internships or jobs in my field. So now, here I am, a failson suicidal college grad at 24 who still lives with his parents: the epitome of everything that can be unattractiv and pathetic about an adult man.   

I’m a complete waste of potential and life. I’ve been nothing but a fuckup and a dissappointment to my family and myself. At nearly 30 years old, I am the complete opposite of what a grown-ass man should be: independent, with a sognificant other and a decent job. Now I break my back for a moving company and come home exhausted and get drunk and binge eat every night. I’m addicted to food and after losing almost 70lbs last year, i’ve gained a lot back because of my addiction. I gorge myself every day because food and alcohol is the only pleasure i get out of life nowadays. My coworkers from my on-campus job no longer reach out to me, and my long-time best friend—who has also dealt with depression—awkwardly stopped messaging me when i confided in him that i think about killing myself every day.   

I’ve attempted suicide in the past and i keep a suicide note written to my parents and  sister in case I need to end it if the pain and loneliness gets too bad. I’m thinking it’s going to be that time very soon. I’m so depressed that I have frequent nightmares about me dying or being dead. 

I hate my existence and want to just fucking die in my sleep tonight. If there were a merciful god, he’d just fucking kill me and put me out of my misery. I just want to rope. I literally have nothing to live for: no meaning or purpose in my life other than to work my ass off to pay off a debt for the rest of my pathetic shitty fucking life. That’s it. That’s all i am.

I’ve discovered that I can only really find happiness through others mostly friends. My parents will always find something to get upset at me for which is why I usually avoid telling them about my life. For example, I found that I really enjoy working on cars even though I dont really know what to do most times a quick YouTube search will walk me right through it. I asked if I could try to do an oil change which is coming up anyway. I was told “no because when you screw it up I don’t want to pay to get it fixed because you made the problem worse” and it really hurts when you want to try something you know you are passionate about and your parents completely shoot you down. The few mods I have done to my truck I really enjoyed it and want to do more but there isn’t really a way for me to do it. Anyway, I have realized that I don’t really deserve happiness, not really sure if I want it either. I’m used to being sad and lonely I don’t really want to change it. I’m just comfortable with it. I know that getting a girlfriend will help me to feel better. I want to give someone the happiness I have to give but don’t deserve myself. Even though a girlfriend would make me happy. I just want someone to love. I just want to know what it’s like to feel loved, and cared about in a way friends just don’t satisfy. I just want someone that I can hold in my arms while she falls asleep on my chest. I have never been in a relationship before and my friend has been in at least 2. I mean, I think I’m a nice guy but why don’t I deserve someone that cares about me. There’s this girl that I really like, but we don’t talk.

I can kinda figure out how to act when I spend enough time around people, but even then it’s just this surface level repetitive crap, I imagine it like an AI trying to replicate social interaction based on watching humans interact. Not only does this leave me bored but also extremely worn out to the point that I usually decide that it isn’t worth it.
Like I said, I’m okay with this most of the time. I love being by myself because I get to be the real me, I don’t have to hide aspects of myself or pretend to be someone else to appease others. I can do the things that I like and not have to pretend to enjoy doing what others like. And so, I choose to spend most of my time alone, sometimes interacting with others if it is necessary or if I feel somewhat sociable (usually after being alone for long periods). 

However, occasionally I do get this horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach accompanied by the thought that I’ll never ever have a truly meaningful relationship with anyone. It’s foolish since I know that I would not enjoy a proper friendship or romantic relationship since it’s too much commitment and would completely drain me. But at the same time, I find myself depressed, thinking about how I’ll never have that group of friends to laugh with, to play video games with, to go for walks in the park with. I’ll never have that friend who you can tell absolutely anything to and talk about what’s bothering you and they’d never tell anyone else, or that friend who you could spend hours upon hours with and never get bored or worn out. I’ll never wake up to that special someone sleeping in my arms. I’ll never hear someone say ‘I love you’ and mean it.

It makes me ponder over whether life is actually worth it. I’m sure I’ll probably do fine at uni since I’ve always done decently academically. Maybe I’ll get a well paid job as a neuroscientist and eventually be able to afford my dream house way out in the countryside away from everything and everyone. But what’s the point of all that if I have no one to share it with? 

Sorry for posting such a long screen of text. I’m sure no one cares enough to read it all anyway, but I think this was more useful as a way to get my feelings out rather than anything else.",lonely,I’ll never ever get to feel that ‘close’ feeling to another person,2020-09-29 10:39:41

150,cyclopsx3001,1601331099,1,"I'm 19\[m\] and for a while, i haven't been happy. This is my first time posting. I've been reading posts to at least relate to people. i wanted to keep quiet about my situation but i just can't. I have a friend or two i can talk to but I feel like they've gotten tired of me and my sob story. so now i feel like this is all I have in a way.  I don't even know what truly I want for what i'm feeling to go away. It started after I got my second certification for firefighting, I got home and celebrated by myself after my mom didn't seem to care. I decided to just watch a movie and after a while of loosing interest, I started to think about things and realized that I'm pretty freaking lonely. I moved up north, most of my friends are down south, I don't have friends to be with up here, the one friend I have moved and tbh as much as i like him, I don't like hanging out with him much. Girlfriend? ha no. That's the other problem. I've never had a girlfriend. Never kissed a girl, still a virgin. At first it didn't bother me at all. While everyone was fucking and having relationship problems, I was chilling in the back with no problems collecting action figures. I thought, i'll worry about that after i'm set up with my career. It was like that till that night that i realized how i felt. It started to bother me so much that i'd cry about it when by myself or get emotional when I tried talking about it with a few people. I met a girl, older than me by quite a bit but nothing crazy, and I fell in love with her. When I had met her, I heard she liked me and I told the person who told me to tell her I'm not interested. But after a while, I started to like her. We agreed to be friends because of our age gap and I just wasn't sure if it would work out and on her end, why would she want to be with me. We hung out and became good friends. I still had feelings for her though and she knew it and idk what she felt about me at the time. We would talk like if we were going to eventually be together and that really excited me. We'd even cuddle at nights we hung out.  One night though I saw she was sad and the next day when I offered her my shoulder, she had told me for personal emotional reasons having to do with her past, she had slept with a random guy. A guy who wanted some quick action. It broke me a little at the moment but i understood why she did it. It still hurts to think about it because here I am someone who cares and actually likes her and has been only good to her and she didn't even give me a chance. I don't think she took me serious. I still think she doesn't. I decided to look elsewhere and still remain friends with her because she was still my only friend and i cared about her still. I had lost some feelings for her but something was still there. One night she told me she liked me but that she wasn't sure if i would be willing to be with her. But I was 100% willing to be with her. She told me to forget about what she said and the next day i tried to talk about it because i wanted to let her know i felt the same but she kept shutting me up and telling me she didn't want to talk about it. It left me broken and confused. I thought finally i'm going to be with someone. But no. After a couple more things that happened, we don't talk much. I still think about her a lot and everything that happened still brings me to tears. I feel like i cant talk to her anymore, like when everything was normal. At least i feel that way, everything may be fine on her end. A thought that kills me is that she doesn't care about me anymore and if she wants she can find someone without trying and yet i cant. where does that leave me, alone. I kind of hate her but I don't also. I think what hurts me is I've never been so close to having a girlfriend. I know there's been girls who have liked me but it never went anywhere because really of insecurities. And those who I've liked, would never like me back or would tell me ""gross"" when i'd mention what i felt about them. And tbh, who would want to go out with a 300lb ""looser"". Now I'm 230lbs and way better looking. I'm loving, caring, respectful, and easygoing. But yet no one cares, no one takes me serious, and not even to give me a chance. I guess nice guys do finish last. I've tried to change everything I could about myself but it didn't work. Everyone says that I'll find someone and I shouldn't worry about that, while they already have had what i want, someone to love me and everything it comes with it. Perhaps I just don't want to feel this loneliness anymore. I know every other problem doesn't go away and that being in a relationship can bring problems but I don't care. All my friends are living and i feel like even with all I've accomplished, I haven't accomplished anything either. I think I also want to just die. I don't see it getting better and I'm tired of it. I don't see someone loving me, I feel stuck in my path on to becoming a firefighter, and I'm just tired of it all. I did plan on doing it a month ago but I didn't do a good job and when it was time, I decided not to and drank myself to sleep. What changed my mind is what an old friend texted me calling me family and that my 5yr old cousin looks up to me a lot. but also as much as I don't want to live anymore, I fear the reaper. I bottled up my emotions for like two weeks and I felt fine for that time but I had a little too much to drink recently and it all came out. I feel like shit and now I'm thinking about suicide quite a bit. You can say people have gone through worse and that I'm just overreacting but let's say one man slept for 4hrs and he's tired. Another man comes who has slept for 1hr. One may have slept more than the other but that doesn't change the one who slept more is still tired. Don't report me or whatever, they're just thoughts and that's all it will probably be, most likely. I think that's all I have to say.

179,puddleOfpebbles,1601299100,1,"I hope everyone is coping today. I'm just here to let some things off of my chest, I hope that's ok. 

I'm having a hard time forming meaningful friendships with people. I feel like I've grown out of the very few friendships I had due to those people gravitating towards gaming and spending most of their time online, finding humour in memes etc, whereas I enjoy being outside in nature and feel that spending too much time in front of a screen is unhealthy, so we have become very incompatible. 

My boyfriend on the other hand agrees with how I view life, and thinks that dedicating too much of our lives to technology is unhealthy, however we also have very differing views regarding race, LGBT and most recently covid-19, so I worry when I think about our future together raising a family, and it leaves me feeling incompatible with him too. Ultimately I feel isolated from all the relationships in my life. 

I've had an online friend, we got on well enough, but it just felt like a huge waste of time, sitting on my phone texting or calling, it didn't fulfil my desire for companionship in the slightest. I want someone to physically be with. 

I have no idea how people make friends with others. I suppose you need to have a stable sense of self and know what really interests you to be able to click with someone, on the other hand maybe that's got nothing to do with it. I wouldn't know. My biggest drawback seems to be when it comes to humour, the only person who seems to get my humour is my mum, and that feels utterly pathetic. It seems like I can't click with people because I can't engage in that back and forth banter that's necessary for a conversation to  flow smoothly. 

I find most people my age immature and obsessed with materialistic or shallow things, I even find myself cringing when they use too much slang, which I know is judgemental, but it's enough to put me off someone completely and write them off as immature. I'll judge my peers to their core for simple things like that, yet if I was to try and start up a conversation with someone older and/or more educated, I'd be completely out of my depth and see myself as immature and incapable of bringing anything worthwhile to the discussion. I don't know how to find the right people for me.

I'll never forget the time during a field trip last year, I had a chance to hangout with my friends for the whole day. They ditched me almost immediately. Although they did at one point tried to comfort me and include me more, I just pushed them away, so it was basically my fault. The worst part about that day was the fact that it was my birthday. It was the worst birthday I have ever had so far. After that, it was all down hill.

When the whole 'Rona thing swept in and shutdown my school, nobody had bothered to call or text me, although to be fair they didn't have my number. Also, on the last day of school before the lockdown, March 19, I confessed my feelings to a girl that I liked, but not surprisingly, she rejected me. I knew that was gonna happen, but it still really hurt.

185,sajon332,1601290783,1,"I think I never realised but I have been always kind of unhappy and lonely. I then met my first love and girlfriend and was really happy for the first time. Well she broke up with me some months ago and I am nothing anymore since then.
 I am heartbroken, I had troubles opening up and letting me be vulnerable, because i have so many self doubts and was hurt by people I trusted before, but she told me so many nice things and ensured me she was serious with me so I let her in my heart. So not long after that, she started showing less and less affection and it really worried and hurt me, to a point where I lost control and hurt her feelings. I did not say anything extremely bad or unrecoverable (in my opinion), but apparently bad enough for her to ditch me over. I apologised and everything, it didn't matter. Since that day she was very cold to be and ended up ignoring me completely. 
What hurts me additionally is that she did not give me a satisfying explanation of why she did it. I mean I know why, but I don't understand it. She used to tell me things like she would never want to stop talking to me ever, that she loved me and I made her feel safe. And that's all gone from the first real fight we had. Now I always think about the time when she was so in love and nice to me and then when she was so cold and indifferent to me. One of her last words to me were: ""I don't want you to understand me, I just want you to leave me."" It still breaks everything inside of me.

I feel so empty, I can't really eat and have to throw up from sadness still regularly. I lost 5 kg and I was underweight before that already (now I am 55kg while 1.85m tall). I feel ugly because of it and it makes me even more sad.

 I lost all of my self esteem and don't really have friends. I only have one online friend left who I can message about my problems, but he never messages me, so I feel like I am bothering him. Besides that I met a girl that was really nice to me and introduced me to her group of friends some days ago. They were all really amazing, but I could not be happy and really integrate into the group. I tried it with weed but it also didn't make me open up more. I noticed they noticed and they tried to include me more, but the fact they noticed and gave me this extra treatment made me even more uncomfortable and sad. The girl then asked me if I could at least find a little bit distraction from my sadness over the girl, but I could not really no matter how hard I tried. And when she mentioned it I had to start crying really hard and could not stop anymore. They were all very understanding and gave me hugs etc., but I still am ashamed for it and I am afraid of them thinking that I am weird for being so weird that day. The girl told me later that I should not worry and that she would make cookies with me next time in a more calm environment. But besides that she also rarely messages me. So I am glad she cares for me so much, but I am scared it is just out of pity, because I dont really understand why she does it.

I stopped studying at uni and applied for a similar thing to uni (like laws, I don't know the English term but it doesn't matter). But if I don't get accepted I have no idea what to do with my life.

My grandmother started being bothered by me being unmotivated to do anything, she told me I am useless, every girl should shoot me to the moon and that I would be a bad choice for any company. She is right and just tries to motivate me to do more but it really does the opposite. 

I am constantly tired and can barely sleep, when I do it is about my ex and how she found someone new or how she tells me to leave her. I'm constantly crying when I am alone.

I also noticed that I can't really think anymore, everything feels confused in my head, I can only kinda sort things when I wrote them down. I feel like everyone is looking or talking about me. I feel worthless. I got some weird hearing problems in my right ear. Everything gets worse and worse.

 I have suicidal thoughts, but I would not do it because of my parents. At least I want to give it one more year and see if I can get friends or if I get accepted where I applied.
I told my internet friend about it, and he told me to do therapy. I know he did it too and is now really successful with women, job, and everything. But I am afraid I won't get a place for it (I don't know how it works, especially during pandemic).

I already called the suicide or depression hotline of my country, but they really could not help me.

Not sure if it is the right place to post it, or why I am even posting it. I think I want to tell anyone but I don't want to tell anyone that knows me about all of this..",lonely,I'm lonely,2020-09-28 20:59:43

190,HaikuCrew_84,1601282686,1,"  ....And if I was, I'd take 'em off, and throw them at you for saying such a thing. 

Lol, I really, really don't like that phrase. Jokes aside, I have a sob story to tell. 

Diving right into it: I'm completely alone. That isn't hyperbole, and it isn't an exaggeration of the truth. I've been ""alone"" my entire life, in the sense that I've always ""felt"" alone amongst the proverbial ""crowd"". Now, however; it's quite literal. 

Skipping my early years, since about 14 my life has been a series of unfortunate events, tragedies, and the worst of coping mechanisms. I knew more about death at that age that I think is healthy for a 16 year old, and furthermore, I knew even less about how do deal with it.

I watched my father waste away, and die of prostate cancer over the course of about 3 years. I saw him go from a healthy, strong man; *my dad:* the guy I used to wake up and run to hug when he would walk in the door, home from the late shift at 12AM. Hah... I never really knew how I would get up like that. I'd be sound asleep, but I would; every time. I'll *never* forget how happy I felt when I would hear his keys jingling around in the door lock.

I watched him waste away, and eventually die a monotonous, painful death in the house he bought for us, and in a cheap looking hospital bed we replaced his queen with. I wasn't a kid anymore, I was a teenager now. And instead of the late night hours being something of a reason to feel joy; they were now filled with the pathetic, agonized whimpers and moans of a man who's body was slowly, and *excruciatingly* betraying itself.  

I would get so *angry*. I wanted to shout. I wanted to scream for him to shut up. The ""Oooooooh..""s and the ""Ahhhhh...""'s... I couldn't TAKE IT. I wanted him to SHUT the FUCK UP ALREADY. I *HATED* him in those moments. He sounded so WEAK, *that fucking pussy...* ""*FUCKING STOP IT. SHUT UP!!! STOP BEING SUCH A FUCKING BITCH AND MAN UP!! STOP IT. STOP making those sounds... please...?!""* 

I would grit my teeth so hard... I prayed for them to *break*, and shatter into pieces so I could furiously spit them out. I wanted to fly into a rage and break every window in the fucking house. The TV, dishes, doors, walls, *all of it.* **Broken.** All of a sudden I knew how to hate. The experience made me hate *myself*. It made me hate the world around me. It made me, *hate.*

My father died at 5AM, on December 11th, 2002. I was sleeping when my Mom came into my room to wake me up. My grandfather was already there- I don't know how long he had been. I had been sat in my room with the shades drawn, and the light off. I just stared at the floor, or the wall I think. I didn't notice anything, really. I was numb. Gramps came in with tears in his eyes- I'd never seen that before. I don't remember him actually walking in, but he had his hand on my shoulder, and told me before he left that, *""He was a good man"".* 

When my Father died, so did I.

I had good friends from the age of 18-25. I got a little better. I wanted to be a musician, and I wanted to be happy. My best friends, Brandon, Chance, Ian, Bryan, David, and Mitch. A host of other really good ones. Kenny, Bear, all the girls, Kyle, Darren, Ray Ray.... So many good people. The good times didn't last all that long, unfortunately. They never do last long enough, do they?

Brandon was driving home from a ""Friends-giving"" out at our friend Paulie's, who lived out in the boonies with two lane roads, no street lights, and 3ft ditches instead of sidewalks. He was about my closest friend next to Chance, who I had known since the age of around 6 or 7. We were there for each other through some really, really hard times. Our bond would have *never* broken; we knew each other better than we knew even ourselves. *I loved him like a brother.*

He fell asleep at the wheel on the way home that night after an argument with his soon to be fiancee, Gina. At 2AM, he violently crashed his baby, a black on black Audi A4, through a 1"" thick rod iron fence at 60mph. He was immediately rendered unconscious. The force of the impact caused one of the iron bars to shoot like a javelin through the front windshield, through his chest, the driver's seat, and part of the rear passenger seat as well. The woman that owned the house the fence surrounded happened to be a nurse. She was by his side 30 seconds after the crash, and held his hand as he slowly bled out. She said there was nothing anybody could have done. I'm thankful he wasn't alone. 

11-17-2012. He would have been 33 this year. 

When I got the news the next morning I immediately flew into a rage. All I could do was scream, and hit the walls of my house over and OVER and OVER again. I felt so HELPLESS. How could this happen?!! He didn't deserve this!! How could he be DEAD?! THIS ISN'T REAL. THIS CAN'T be REAL!!? We had our whole lives ahead of us, it wasn't fair. It wasn't fucking fair. 

We were supposed to grow up and play golf with our kids together.

Gina was made a widow at 24. She was also pregnant. 2 months along. They were going to make the announcement just a week later on thanksgiving. His parents Linda and Steve, would have flipped in such the best way. We had his funeral instead. A packed house.

Gina gave birth to a healthy baby boy in the summer of 2013. She named him Brandon. He looks just like his Dad.

Ian sold him that Audi. It was the first one Brandon ever bought. Ian had bought it after coming home from Afghanistan as an MP in the reserves, but decided to get a truck a while later instead. We used to call him, ""Shmee"". Got it from ""The Hook"" movie from the 90's. Shmee spent 4 years in the military, earned a honorable discharge, but came home... *Different.*

PTSD. Those four letters sting like bullets to hear them. Just as lethal, too.

Ian died of a heroin overdose in the bathroom of a Wal-Mart. His female ""companion"" that night could have saved him, but she was too afraid of forfeiting her *own* freedom, even if it meant saving a life; so quietly, she snuck out into the night, and left my friend, US ARMY SPC. Ian P., alone to silently die of respritory failure. When the paramedics finally arrived he was long since cold, slumped behind a toilet, needle still hanging from the blued skin of his forearm. All he ever wanted was to make his parents, and also his friends, proud. He never realized how proud we actually were.

Chance is a full-blown alcoholic now, and has allowed the worst part of his nature take hold. He drinks more than a 1/5 of vodka a day, every day, and doesn't believe he has a problem. If you saw him, his bright white teeth, charming smile, and flashy hot-hatch Ford, you'd never know. I ended our 28 year-long friendship just 8 months ago. I keep having dreams that we're still the best of friends. It morphs into a nightmare that settles in after I wake from it.

Bryan, Brandon's older brother and another one of my closest friends- he got married to his HS sweetheart Vikki. After 5+ years of marriage they divorced, and bitterly so. He stopped calling, and began to isolate himself. The last I heard, he spends his days at work, and his nights in his room at his aunt's house (His wife got the house) doing a mixture of cocaine, drinking, and playing MMORPGs. I Haven't talked to him in 4+ years.

David is gone. At one point he cared, not anymore though. 10 years ago he stopped calling and that was it. He blames me. I say he needs to invest in a mirror, and a magnifying glass.

Then there's Bear, died of colon cancer at 24. Jason, heroin overdose at 29.... So many others. Of course, my grandpa, the only other member of my family that ever cared enough to involve themselves in my life... He was the toughest son of a bitch I ever knew. A breed of Man extinct from us now.

My last, and only friend studies Astrophysics at New Mexico Tech, in Socorro. He's doing really, really well for himself despite having a rough start in life. Nobody thought he'd ever amount to anything but, jokes on them.

...And that leaves me. The party has long been over, the lights are dimmed, and I'm alone. The floor is littered with krinkled up pieces of brightly colored confetti, and the room is still faintly warm from the living bodies that laughed, and enjoyed each other's company the night before. *I can't let go.* I'm desperately clinging to the scent of the musk and perfumes that still gently hang like wisps of smoke in the air. Slowly, but steadily dissipating into the aether, until there's nothing left but the vaguely stale scent of tobacco smoke, and cooking oil.

The ghosts of my past.

It's all over. I can't let it go, I can't move on. I'm so alone, I feel so hopeless. 

I want my friends back. I want my *friends* back, I want my *friends back*, I want my friends *back*, *I want my friends back*, ***I want my friends back PLEASE, come BACK...***

I can't. ...I can't. Let. Go. I could **never** let go... I won't. I *will* **NOT.** 

*I don't know how.*

i love animals. i’ve had pets ranging from puppies and kittens to fish and hedgehogs. i’m a dog person, but my cat changed my view of felines in general. i’ll send you photos of my dogs and cat, but only if you promise to do the same! free pass if you don’t have any, but i might make you send me cute tiktoks to compensate. 

i’ve found that music is therapeutic for me. what’s on repeat for me? joji’s new album *nectar*. if you’ve listened to it, what’s your favorite song? if you haven’t listened to it....why!? 

i enjoy gaming. i typically stick to 1-3 games at a time, but i’ll play something else if prompted. at the moment, valorant and dead by daylight are my favorites... as well as animal crossing when i’m relaxing in bed. if you have any terraforming tips, please help. i’m lost out here haha 

i’d love to find someone that i can watch shows and movies with. perhaps we could binge watch halloween movies given the fact that it’s spooky szn? if horror isn’t your thing, i’m open to other genres as well! 

above all, i’d like to meet likeminded people that i can form meaningful connections with. if you feel like we’d get along based upon what i’ve written, shoot me a chat or a message!",lonely,another person seeking friendship,2020-09-28 15:09:18

213,GabeIsAMeme,1601268956,1,"The school I go to currently has a mice infestation (as if they didn't need anymore reasons to shut down). And not wanting them to fall victim to the cruel glue traps laid throughout the school I decided  to capture and rescue a couple. I took them home and put them in a normal sized fish tank along with some bedding and a plastic castle for them to hide in. I named them Jerry and Chip. Jerry because of tom and jerry, and Chip because as soon as I got home I gave him a Chip and he immediately started munching away. It took a while for them to adjust but eventually they settled in. Jerry always stayed inside the castle while Chip would constantly roam around. Jerry always kicked Chip out of his castle whenever he'd walk in (which led me to believe they where both males since they were highly territorial) but eventually they came around and started to like each other. Problems arose when the tank started to smell and I realized that I'd eventually have to clean it. So I dumped both of the mice out of the tank and into a rather large box outside in order to scrub down the tank. Once I was finished I scooped Jerry up into a plastic container before lowering it into the make shift pen. Of course my dumbass didn't have the forethought to place a lid over the container so he immediately escaped and scurried off into the alleyway never to be seen again. After awhile I was eventually able to get Chip back into the pen safely and I was left with one lonely mouse. After a couple of days it was clear that he was miserable as he would constantly jump at the ceiling and scratched at the walls indicating that he wanted out. It was comparable to a scenerio where you've been kidnapped and thrown into the back of a van with another person who had also just been kidnapped. But then the other person just disappears. Now I've never been kidnapped before but I'm pretty sure that I would feel a lot safer if there were another person there with me rather than it just being me on my own. I felt like such a monster. I couldn't take watching him claw at the corner of the tank any longer.... So at around 10:30 pm I decided to take him out to the cornfeilds to set him free. It was about a ten minute drive before I found a gravel road that I felt comfortable letting him go near. I set the tank on the ground and took the top off as I proceeded to take everything out except him. I pulled out the bag of chips I brought with me and took one out as I held it near his face. And he actually started eating it while it was in my hand! As cheesy as it sounds, I verbally said goodbye and turned the tank on it side. He ran off into the darkness and that was the last I saw of him. I shouted one more time ""Goodbye Chip!"" And thew a bunch of chips into the corn feild. I got in my car and bawled all the way through the drive home and even more so after I parked in front of the sidewalk that led to my house. I'm not sure why.... Maybe I felt some speacial connection to these particular mice that I knew I'd now never be able to return to, maybe I was upset that I couldn't even get a pair of common house mice to like me, or maybe it was something completely unrelated. I'm not really sure why I decided to post this story here. Been a lurker here for a long time. I guess a part of me just needed to share it with someone. And being as I've never felt close to anyone in my life before I suppose it's appropriate. I don't know, what do you think? Am I a monster? Did you enjoy reading my little story? Was writing this page of text just a total waste of time? Haha. Let me know.... I could really use someone to talk to.....

It’s tough to even verbalize how I feel on a daily basis because I really don’t even know what I’m feeling half the time. I feel a lot of emotions but the one that always stands out the most: loneliness. I have a very small family (basically just my mom and brother) who I’m pretty close with but it’s tough because I feel like they don’t even know who I really am. Shit, I don’t even know who I am most of the time.

I just want to feel like I mean something to someone. I’m so sick of feeling useless and like I’m no good for anyone. I was heavier my whole life and recently I have lost a hundred pounds. I have some more to go but I feel like I was even happier before I lost the weight. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great losing weight and getting in shape. But I felt like I used to enjoy my life more.

I have 2 close friends who mean the world to me. I lean on them in tough times but I feel like I annoy them so I try not to bother them most of the time. It’s just my annoying bullshit, right? I have other friends but I just don’t talk to many people anymore. I struggle to keep a conversation going. I don’t even want most people to remember I even exist most of the time. I’d rather just be left alone.

I’m sick of feeling so useless and worthless. I want to believe I’m worth getting someone good but Everytime it seems like I’m getting somewhere with a girl who means something to me I always get fucked somehow. It’s always one step forward and two steps back. I can’t take much more of the let downs, it makes me not want to even try anymore.

I’m really just at a loss. If you made it through my incoherent ramblings above, thank you. All I ever want to do is cry and let myself get these emotions out but I don’t know how to do that. All I know how to do is cover it up and hide and lie and pretend I’m fine. But it’s draining me more every single day. I don’t know how much longer I can keep putting on a brave face and acting like the 22 year old college senior who has it together when in reality I’m the furthest fucking thing from it.

That includes subreddits such as this one or the various dating subreddits.
Its intriguing to me to see people so fixated on one thing, relationships in any kind or form.

So I always wondered, how exactly is it that people become lonely? Do you just suddenly feel that way because you don't have enough friends, or because you're a virgin with no experience at the age of 20?
Is it something deeper?

251,suicidaland,1601242731,1,"I’m 21, M, I wasn’t always “attractive” but around 18 I kind of changed from a nerdy, overlooked, shy guy to being considered beautiful and attractive to many. My face changed, I started looking after my skin, got trendy haircuts and dressed more trendy. 

People began flocking to me, treating me as something special. I wasn’t used to so much attention. It took a long time to adjust because inside I was still a “weird kid” I just didn’t look the part. 

So, yeah, I had a lot of opportunities to make friends, get a boyfriend (yes I’m gay), etc. But I have severe depression and anxiety, partly because of childhood trauma. I’ve been suffering from it since I was 14, and my external change and the difference in how I was being treated didn’t change anything inside of me. 

I ruined so many potentially great things because of my mental health, I never let anyone remotely close, never let down my walls. I hated/hate myself and therefore automatically think once others get to know me they will too, so I never give them the chance to. 

It doesn’t matter how many compliments I get, how many people approach me, check me out, I still see no value in myself. 

I come across as cold, distant, anxious, always in a bad mood, which obviously turns people off even though I try to be sociable and happy but I just can’t fake it. 

I’ve been lonely for such a long time, even when I’ve been with others, my anxiety takes over and I can’t enjoy anything. So why put others in misery just because I’m miserable? I don’t have any friends, no one that checks up on me, cares about me. I’ve never had an actual boyfriend, I’m  often isolated and alone, I don’t fit in or belong anywhere. Life is so lonely and I think about suicide everyday.

Either one of two things happen: I meet a nice, affectionate, and caring guy and then it just turns out he just wants me to see me get naked (joke is on him, really. I’m not attractive). Or, two, I meet someone who really doesn’t get me and he winds up abandoning me. I’m a (overly) sensitive guy and very affectionate. I need to be hugged and held more so than your average Joe off of the street. I get that it’s not for everyone, but surely there is someone the same way that doesn’t have the end goal of something sexual in mind.

I lost my best friend nearly five years ago. He walked out of my home one day and I never heard from him again. He blocked me on social media and blocked my number. We had never argued or even had one fight. I  have no idea why he left. He just did. I still shed a lot of tears over him. People tell me to move on and let it go, but he was the only one who ever hugged me and let me just be me. He wasn’t a true friend, I know this now, but some how he made me feel loved and cared about. I want another “him” but this time someone that’ll stay. To this day I can’t stop thinking about getting the chance to ask him his reason for abandoning me. I consider myself an educated and moderately intelligent person. But this is one puzzle I can’t solve and it kills me. I never had friends as a childhood. I won’t get into why, but I was very lonely and my parents and I had a pretty volatile relationship.

I've always known how shitty i am but i thought that since my friends stayed for some time, maybe they didn't mind? I was young and dumb i guess. Here's my report:

2-3rd grade i used to straight up kick and wound my friends. sorry broskies.

4th grade, new friends, i pretended to not notice my friend's hints that she liked me, crawled away from her cuz i felt creeped out by her hints. she confessed in 8th grade that she used to like me. we strangerz nowz. im so sorry.

5-6th grade, left the friend group cuz we didn't have common interests, became friends with people my old friends used to talk shit about(i never really cared about their drama). Also became friends with transferee. i didnt know that i literally made everything about me and i had spread a joke about her coochie having a big bush. yeah she's an acquaintance now. I'm terribly sorry.

Also 6th grade, an ex-bestfriend told me that he liked me, rejected him by saying that i had a crush on his other best friend even tho i didnt. i know, huge dick move. My apologies.

7th grade, new best friend is from the group my friends used to talk shit about. Great person. Lasted until 8th grade but...

8th grade, she was breaking the friendship off because of a friend that's kinda snobby to everyone but she cool i guess. i was like, ok i'm sorry and this is where i realize how disgusting and toxic i am. real late yuh yuh. up till this point i had always thought i was a normal ok friend but fuck no dude. why did no one tell me? i had to lose so much great company cuz of my dumb ass.

rn im in 9th grade, 4 of the people from the group are still with me. i love them but even tho im trying my best to become a better person, i sometimes forget and i hurt them unintentionally. They just laugh it off but i hate hurting them in any way.

I genuinely don't know if i'm real, it is even more so difficult to discern who I am. Now everyone feels this in part, the occasional disassociation seems intrinsic to consciousness but this has been exacerbated to an almost impossible degree. Interactions, moreover, reactions indicate (reflect) many things; one of importance being your own character. Now this has it's flaws, I know, but it at least gives a basis to stand on. You're too complex to figure yourself out on your own without cultural presuppositions (in which all discussion is predicate). Now all this isn't to show off my interest in philosophy and psychology, because who cares? The point is to briefly explain why I feel this disassociation from people, my culture, and general existence. It's a deeper problem than what I've outlined and I expect many people are affected by this positive feedback loop.

I seriously don't know if anything, including my suffering, can be taken seriously! I really am quite desperate for some sort of confirmation of my experience; To all this, say, if I only received the letter 'h' as a response from one person, that would probably mean just as much as any romantic gesture. I can barely tell if it's me typing these words.

I've attempted to communicate with spirits, archetypes, gods just to alleviate the loneliness, in which there has been no success. It would seem that my essence damned. I've dedicated much time into evoking insanity in myself in some perverse way to justify my loneliness, which has counter productively increased my shame and loneliness at least tenfold. I've deluded myself to ideas of grandeur just to juxtapose the inferiority caused by my irrepressible social cowardice.

I entered high-school with more friends than that I finished with, in both quality and quantity. I have also left with no prospects, so it would seem now my only options here on out are homelessness or suicide. Or I can try go insane and end up in a psychiatric ward for the rest of my life but I already tried that; I don't know how close I got but as far as i'm concerned, it's a horrible way to live. Perhaps I won't have a choice though if worse comes to worse.

Basically, no matter what direction I take, the loneliness only increases. I have no idea why I am compelled to tell strangers all this, anything to just briefly attenuate the all encompassing depressive isolation I guess. I must include as precaution that my speech is so disfigured by my persistent mendacious behavior that I am unsure if I have even told one truth here (or in my entire life for that matter), I have already left out much information as it is. This has all been my fault, you would not pity me if you knew what I have done.

I can't help but feel like my life is dead in the water. I'm not where I thought would career-wise. Maybe I have stark expections or I lack patience.

I haven't dated anyone and I don't think I'd make a good partner, so I've kinda made my peace with that. 

I don't think I'm depressed. I feel like people use that word to express a multitude of emotions like sadnesses, being annoyed or upset in the moment. Or maybe they are actually depressed, who am I to know. I just feel grey most of the time. That's the best way I can describe it.

I particularly hate that I feel superior to everyone I talk to. All my friends don't have ambitions, or career ideas. Just the idea that others matter more. I try to encourage them to work on themselves, because the always vent to me, or display concern for their lack of happiness. And my closest friend doesnt take care of herself or her home.

And yet, here I am, also doing nothing with my life, but acting as though Im on that grind or something. Im not. Im just sitting here. Writing on reddit. Complaining.

But I just don't understand. I feel so disconnected to these people, because they don't have ambitions, hopes or plans. Im always thinking about the future. I feel alone.

I'd like to tell myself I'm not a narcissist. But I know a professional would probably say I am with everything I say. I've never been to one though. I just find it comforting to think of myself as superior, but when I realize I'm not, I slump down into thinking Im the worst. But most of the time its both at the same time. Knowing Im the worst, but thinking Im the best, or that I know more.

I don't want to think too highly of myself. But I don't know how to tone it down without completely hating myself. I just want to feel normal.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. I could speak all day. Thats all I ever want to do is talk. And talk. And talk. And just be heard. But I probably dont deserve it.

I love people and really like digging into context and how you think and what your perspectives are. 

It's difficult to describe myself but I fall somewhat in the meta category, I'm ENFJ, and Type 2 (sometimes 7)- Enneagram, I love psychology, and architecture. I completed my degrees in accounting and finance, and work as a financial advisor. I've been playing guitar for 12 years and I love all music and acoustic design. 

I always thought I'd be the type to fall in love and that would be my person forever, that however didn't happen and after a 5 year long relationship I lost her. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger though, right? Went on a bit of a mental health journey this summer and feel pretty good about where I'm at now. 

I have a background context of Christianity but am extremely open-minded. I've smoked many many different strains of marijuana and have earned the connosiuers title, as well as a larger number of psychedelic trips and other such recreational drug experiences. 

I have friends that I love to death but their approaches to life just don't seem like they're really aiming at creating a beautiful life. Which is what I want to create with someone who knows me and can accept my flaws which I know all to well, I'm hard to talk to at first but I really do grow on you and once I care about you as a person I can promise that we'll become friends for a lifetime. 

I'm reaching out on here because, I wanna meet knew people or least conversate with new people, and I am really having trouble keeping my mind off of my ex (as obviously I really really miss her but out of respect I think it's smartest to stay out of her life).

I'm the type of guy that all women say they want, but then it turns out that they want more. I was raised well and taught how to be a man of both passions and demeanor. I am very prone to an enlarge ego and often refrain from praising myself so that I don't lighten up and go easy on being the character of the people that I look up to most in the world. 

I've met very very few individuals that can think on my level and usually then ones that can have autism and cannot communicate. If I'm attracted to you my dick will try to make its own type of connection but I'll always keep him in check. (But with my libido you really just have to ignore my horny side because he's always ready to go.) 

I'm 5'9"" Indian by ethnicity but mostly white by personality, acid changed my life, but losing the first love of my life scarred it. I'm eloquent smart and would love to meet anyone who is interested in what I've posted here. I'm attractive but as anyone else I can always eat better.

 
I really get along with everyone I've ever met and hope that I meet some cool people through doing this. I'm Intelligent and will happily answer any and all types of questions, but I want you to be genuinely curious otherwise well there's no meaning in communicating if there's no genuine interest behind the words.

I grew up extremely quiet and shy and it took practically my whole childhood for me to open up. There are 5 people I consider friends but I barely hear from them and we definitely don’t hang out. The one person I was able to hang out with (my best friend) died last October and I’ve been lonely ever sense. This semester was supposed to be my first semester on a university campus. I graduated from a small community college and everyone just came to class and went home. There was no campus life.

332,Diana_2277,1601169219,1,"
I grew up in a mentally abusive household, so now that I'm sixteen that's made me have some lovely anxiety issues, love it lol. Family wasn't great obviously, but I at least have one person that's okay. The one nice family member I have is quite weird with emotions. Don't get me wrong i love them to bits, but they just don't seem to want to talk about them. Even they don't seem to care about me that much though. They say they love me etc but whenever I go to talk to them they always seem like they want me to just leave and like I'm annoying, yet Im speaking to them normally, so I just end up leaving.

The closest person to me that isn't ""family"" was my ex, but they turned out to be manipulative, abusive and a feminazi among other things... Yikes. Even when we were doing well everything was always about them, and how they were feeling. Sure, I did have emotional rants and they would listen and try and sympathise, but the way they treated me in general showed they never actually cared, and would often make ""funny"" jokes at my expense. When I would get upset and say it didn't seem like they cared because of the way they acted, they just said I was too sensitive, laughed and blanked me for a couple of days.

Safe to say I try not to talk to that person much anymore.

So now the only others in my life are my ""friends"" at school, they are nice, but we only really talk in school. I message them out of school but they never really message me first etc. So essentially I stay with them so I'm not alone in school, and after school I will probably never talk to them again. Nothing against them, but I doubt any of them will talk to eachother after school, so you probably get the gyst of the friendships.

I almost died two months ago. Seriously I was about five minutes from cardiac arrest. Adrenaline kept me alive. I promised myself I would never be that alone ever again, and I would never be that helpless ever again. But I still both. I tried to really figure out who I am and the answers I came up with are pathetic. I'm a liar, like a chronic liar. I lie about everything because I can't stand the truth that I'm nothing, hell less than nothing. At least space and time exist in what we think of as nothing. I always wanted to be great at something and love it. I may have fallen in love with some different hobbies but I was never good at them, let alone great. I talk about myself more than anything else trying to build myself up to others but again they're mostly lies. If I don't like me how can anyone else? The world keeps getting worse making it harder for myself and everyone like me who struggle during the best of times. I keep asking myself why I survived the car crash? There are so many different, better people more deserving that died that day around the same time, but I survived. I almost lost my right hand, at first they were thinking amputation but I was sent to my state capitol to their best hospital. The on call surgeon in the ICU was good, very good. She managed to clean a lot of the debris from my hand and temporarily stitch my hand up until a specialist could look at it. That woman saved my hand. It my dominant hand at that. The upper extremity doctor managed to repair the tendons and took out two small bone fragments and put them back in place, as well as stich my middle finger back together. It'll have two big chunks missing for the rest of my life but I should make an almost full recovery with some permanent nerve damage and slight loss of motion in my wrist. However it still doesn't make sense why I survived. Had my head been two inches to the left part of the windshield would have gone through my eye. It's sad the most interesting thing about me is the time I almost died. I feel like it was a mistake for me to survive. What's the point of living without love?

So I bought a house, my first house, and it’s my first time living alone. I didn’t know it would feel like this. Thank god I have my dog.

All I can think about is waking up next to my ex, really all I can think about his him. All of the time. Even though I broke up with him. I feel lost about it all.

I don’t have friends. I have the people I work with, who I love, but the friendships don’t leave work. My hometown friends dropped me because I said I’d hang out with them a bunch and just ended up blowing them off. I wish they could have understood or even cared to ask how I was feeling after a traumatic breakup and living alone in a town I’m not from. But it was easier for them to not have to deal with me at all I guess.

I don’t have anyone to laugh with, to lay next to in bed. I don’t have anyone to wake up and watch the news with me, or to cook dinner for. I don’t have anyone to sit by the fire with me, with my new fire pit I bought. I just don’t really have anyone. 

My mom coming over is the best, she helps me clean and paint and do stuff around the house. I feel normal when she’s here. It’s a contrast because when I lived there I felt suffocated and couldn’t wait to get out. I can’t believe how much I took her for granted. 

I don’t know how to make a friend, where to find one, how. I’ve never been good at keeping a friend, obviously. It’s a shame because I regard myself as a fun easy going person. People don’t know this side of me, I’m good at hiding it.

So, I don’t do anything. No love, no friends. What do normal people do? Enjoy life outside of the house? Alone? I don’t know how and I’m afraid to try. The guilt sets in when I do nothing but stay around the house. But what am I supposed to do? No, really, WHAT should I be DOING? Because I don’t even know anymore.

363,ElectronicWorking644,1601148452,1,This is just my perspective but recently i just think that not all people need freinds. Dont get me wrong but being lonely can be also positive. What i feel the reason why we are lonely and dont have much freinds is because we are all wholesome people inside who are capable of taking care of ourselves on our own. We complete ourselves and dont need anyone to depend on. This is how i see things. The reason why we feel depressed is because of society making it seem like we need freinds and need people. So guys lonely people are awesome people just believe in yourself detach from this world and change what you can control dont give out or waste your time on things you cant change. Spend time on things you can change. That's what stoicism is about. So dont worry about the world just stay true to yourself and enjoy life doing things your way. If you meet people and make freinds then that's cool. Other than that don't depend on it. You cant control it. So stay positive guys.

I am a 20y/o medical student living in Australia for past 2 years. I have had alot of friends but as life progressed everyone moved to different places and started a new life, like high school friends moved to different college, childhood friends to different countries and it's not like we don't talk, we causally talk sometimes mostly on birthday's wishing each other or sharing memes sometimes thats all. I had a girlfriend and everything was working great but later on it got long distance when I moved her and till now everything was great but last night she broke up with me because she couldn't handle the distance and idk it broke me and made miserable, now I'm just trying to distract myself trying to make friends I can talk to because I don't know I don't feel good at all and idk why my happiness was dependent on a single person but it was and now as she's gone I can't think straight. So was just hoping to find some friends here to talk to, don't worry I won't bother you with depressing texts. 

Here's something about me,

I workout alot and I go for a run everyday at 4am ( not doing it since last 2 days since I don't even feel motivated enough to do anything anymore)

I read alot of books and write whenever i have time 

I have pretty much  watched  every tv series on Netflix and prime along with the animes( my personal favs are death note and Jojo)

I play video games too currently playing among us, fall guys and valorant. 

I play volleyball and football for fun(soccer for my american mates)

Love outdoor activities and traveling

And I would absolutely prefer karaoke night over club nights

If you think I'm interesting and we can really connect then text me, and if you are going to text me for a one time thing then please don't. I want someone with whom  I can talk  about everything/anything and at any time of the day. 

Age doesn't matter idc whether you're 17 or 82.

Obviously in school, at breakfast and lunch, I sit with them (as well as the lesson that my female friend and I share) but outside of school I don't hang out with anyone and we rarely message each other. They go places together, sure, but if I was to join them that would just be awkward.
It also doesn't help that I have some social anxiety as I always feel like people are judging me even when they probably don't give a shit. I think part of this is due to me being gay (although I've been out since summer) and so I'm always worrying.
I don't have any other friends and I don't even have any group just to talk to. I don't even speak to people next to me in lesson (even though they try to have conversations with me) I just give a short answer and that's that.
Recently it's becoming hard sitting inside by myself with nothing to do/ no one to talk to. I want people I can talk to and hang out with, while feeling a part of the conversation.

The first one made my life hell, physically and emotionally abusive as well as having a narcissistic mother who fucked with my mums head and called the police on us numerous times. Sexually abused his sister when she was far too fucking young (not that any age would be even remotely acceptable). Finding out the latter really broke me, and I ended up abusing pills and alcohol. I was with him from 15-17. 

The second one, I naively jumped into a relationship with straight away. I stayed with him for 2 years, and we just ended things on sour terms. He didn't hit me, or insult me, so I took that to mean he was a wonderful partner. I inored all the red flags that I might have seen if I wasn't so blinded by my last relationship. He might not have been abusive but he didn't care, not really. Although I do believe he loves me and my dog in his own fucked up way.

It felt like everything was coming together, but unfortunately went full blown negative when we were talking about love and sex since I mentioned I was writing a love story. I was talking about how I thought love was unachievable no matter how hard you try, because it is not perfect, and how I am still ashamed for being a virgin. I try not to let these things get the best of me, since I know I have it good here in Japan. Certainly better than last year, but my thoughts on love and sex unfortunately are still the same. He called out on me for not trying even though I know he was trying to help me. I came up with endless excuses on why I couldn't do it when some opportunities presented themselves. I can't date employees (my company would fire my ass), some girls didn't interest me, people on social dating apps are not responsive, etc. If nothing else I am trying really hard to be more open with these kinds of things and most of all and I just realized this. I don't know what I want anymore, because it all doesn't matter. There is no competition. Sure I want to have sex but there are days when I'm like eh and others where I'm like oh God I only have one life. Same with love. The confusion gives me such a headache. People tell me you should try, or you should stop looking for it and it'll happen. I know these things are true to a certain extent but damn its confusing as hell. Plus I am incredibly shy. It takes a miracle for to just come up to a pretty girl. I come up with excuses like she might be married, she might be gay, she might have a boyfriend, even though knowing is better than nothing, even if you get nothing out of it. I think I should just stop talking about it. My friend who means well said he doesn't mind hearing me vent but he didn't know how to help me and I just said nobody can help me. I know you probably will ask well what is it that you want and all I can say is I don't know. Life is confusing enough. I believe there is more to life than love, and if you are just pursuing love than that is really bad for you, because anything can go wrong. It's like exercising. If you do it because it makes you feel then great, then love or sex can be the bonus. Sometimes I wish I can stop dwelling and talking about these things because its so confusing. What is more confusing is that I will never get the answers. My own father who loves my mother probably still to this day, has no fucking clue how women think.

I did all the tricks. I got ""over"" her getting under someone. Then another. Then another after that one. Then I lost count.

I found friends. Then a lot of friends. We'd go out, party a little. One by one, they found someone at x or y party or bar. Slowly my friends stopped going out. Then I was too old to make new friends in a small town.

I started drinking. Weekends at first. Then a little before bed. Then I needed it to sleep. Now, I'm hung over every morning. My hair is turning grey. Where I used to have abs, I now have a painful reminder of my pathetic failure and addiction.

21 little souls that I teach rely on my mental stability every day. I HAVE to be strong for them. I HAVE to be there for them. They need me.

I've resigned myself. I'm a shell. I'm a husk. Once these kids are out for the winter, once they forget about me a little, I'll be able to rest forever. No more pain. No more empty bed. No more read receipts. No more meeting people. No more fake get-to-know-you dates. No more pain. No more games.

I can free up my spot for a valuable, loved person who needs the money, needs the opportunity. They can burn me up, wrap me in cardboard, and stick my mortal remains in a closet and forget about me.

I know having someone to talk to makes my life more pleasant than a lot of people on this sub. But I can't talk to him about anything that's bothering me emotionally. The few times I tried he made jokes about what I was saying or ignored me. Not the most conducive to me wanting to try again. So yeah no emotional support. Not what I'd call a real friend.

People don't like me in real life. I'm weird and no one wants to hang out with the weird guy. So I don't meet new people. It's hard for me to speak with new people and within 15 seconds of me meeting them their facial expression changes from polite indifference to active dislike. Never been good at putting myself out there and I don't want to try if that's all that's going to happen.

Online people are flaky. Im not weird over the internet but I'm not good at conversation either. And I'm not interesting. So I guess it makes sense that people will leave. But it's just depressing to put effort into meeting someone and getting to know them, then have them slowly stop talking to you. Even though you put in all the effort, learning about their lives, carrying the conversation, showing interest. The worst is when you've known them for a while and their answers slowly start to take longer, the conversations slowly becoming shorter and shorter. And you don't want to give up because they're your friend, so you keep trying, but you know it's pointless.

If I could find a partner that would be perfect. Someone who would not only talk to me every day but would care about me. That's the only answer I can think of that would work. If you can't find a friend anywhere, someone to care, just find a partner who wants to care. She'll talk to you every day because she wants to, and you won't feel socially isolated anymore. And I do sometimes wish for companionship as well.

But I know it will never happen. No friends, no partner. It's been 8 years since I had a female friend for any length of time. And I'm uglier now than I was then. Ugly on the inside, ugly on the outside. What person would come along and be there for me?

I just have to learn to live with it. Life isn't so bad even with no one who cares. We can find things to do to occupy ourselves. We can be better people so that when we are gone, our legacy is not suffering. That's the best I can hope for.",lonely,A little bit sad,2020-09-26 14:23:48

Everyone else seems to have, not just a friend here and a friend there, but an actual cohesive GROUP where everyone knows each other.

They are so comfortable with each other and have no issues being physical with each other (see: other girls falling into each other’s arms, laughing uproariously and climbing all over each other, whereas I’m nearly too stiff and uptight to give a hug) 

Was it because I didn’t make friends in college? Is this the magical place to make friends?

My main goal was to make friends, but people more treat me like a resource (no one talks to me for social purposes, I’m excluded from social activities, and it doesn’t help I don’t live in the same housing as other students). One of my good friends told me that some people who he knows in his building say that I’m socially inept/basically a loser. 

I did make a few friends, but they have begin to tease me a lot, calling me a “simp” since I am trying to find a nice girl in our class/elsewhere.

I usually go driving each night, around 10/11pm just to clear my mind and give my mind something to focus on rather than recirculating dark thoughts.

I went to NYC all by myself in March and despite all the fun things to do in the city, weirdly my favourite thing I did whilst there was sitting on this large rock in central park for hours on end watching the sun slowly fall and the surroundings getting quieter, I've never been more relaxed/peaceful and at ease than how I was in this moment, it felt like the world was mine for the taking.

The VW had to do the same so I parked next to it and immediately heard loud hip hop music coming from the car. This was an hour ago around 2am and it was raining.

Next thing I know, these 2 very attractive girls got out from the back seat and started to act all exuberant. They appeared to be mid-20's at the most and was dressed in a revealing fashion like strippers. They certainly looked promiscuous, of high maintenance and appeared like they get sex - probably from a different guy every night. After getting out, they ran to the front of the car to playfully put on a cheap show for the 2 guys sitting in the front seats. They were dancing erotically, laughing and acting obnoxiously ignorant.

The guy sitting shotgun yelled at them jokingly ""get your asses back in here!!"" and so they did as they ran back into the car. For me, I was sitting in my own car shaking my head with sadness and regret on how I missed out in life because I never got to be like those guys in that white VW.

I feel that, if I wanted to talk to them, I'd have to find the right time so I don't interrupt their lives. I don't like to waste or take away from people's time. 

I recently made a post on one of my socials about the troubles I have been having.  Without going to detail on that post, I alluded to a number of things while also mentioning feeling alone. Now I'm usually one to not post to my socials about my personal troubles, so it was seen as uncharacteristic to those that I know. In fact, I usually would use Facebook to post private and locked posts about my personal troubles. Typing out my troubles in private help sometimes. But this time I was curious as to what would happen if I told the world my problems.  I was inundated with comments, reactions, and private messages. Most had the ""we're here to talk"" comment. A few shared what they were going through and I absolutely appreciate them for sharing their personal troubles, some that I didn't expect were having any themselves. 

What I want is for someone to sit with me and have a heart to heart in person. I just want that feeling of someone physically there that after I pour my heart out with incessant rambling, I can just be embraced by them. Free of judgement of my choices and feelings. I want to be visibly vulnerable to someone because I am tired of going to work pretending that everything is ""OK"" while at my core I am not fine. I don't want to do it over text because I want what comes out of my mouth to be raw and unfiltered. Everything in that social media post and even this Reddit post is curated and filtered. I want to be in a private and dimly lit place as I open my shell and take off the clown mask I've been wearing for years.

In my job, I have a multitude of resources such as access to counseling, chaplains (not religious, but they aren't exclusive to those without faith), and my own leadership. I am surrounded by peers and friends and I feel that I am in a positive and supportive environment. I haven't sought after these resources because my own self minimizes my problems. And I feel selfish for having access to these resources and not using it. I feel that I can quietly move on waiting for change to happen without my own input. I feel that there are people out there with bigger and worse problems compared to mine.   
But there is that fear of opening up to friends and peers who all work together. The fear that I would be labeled with whatever negative thing I think I would be labeled as while all my peers walk on eggshells around me. I don't want that. I would hate looking like a wounded animal. In public.

So...after sharing all that.... I just don't know when I will find that someone that I feel I can open up to. I know it's a matter of ""when"" and that it will not ever be ""never."" I don't know what I wanted to gain for typing all this up, when in reality I should have been writing a paper for a class that I'm in. I guess I want a the perspective of a stranger on the internet or maybe mutual agreement.... I don't think I am seeking a solution as I can identify what my problem is: my reluctance in using the help presently available to me. I'm just an idiot.

My mom died of cancer when I was 5 and I never knew my dad. My aunt and uncle took us in so we didn't end up in foster care. My uncle molested me my aunt never really believed me and it kind of disappeared and never talked about again and he never did it again. To this day idk how but I still love them. They raised us and only parents I truly know. They kicked me out at 15 when they found out I was dating an older guy (my current relationship) I've kind of been on my own since. Our relationship is good now with them. Idk why i feel like I'm running in place with my life. I graduated 8 months pregnant after everyone said I would drop out i graduated my graduating year. I got my CNA as soon as I had my son. Worked doing that for 2 years wasn't my cup of tea. I've been at my current job for 2 years im about to be 24 in  November and I feel like I've done nothing with my life don't get me wrong we own 2 vehicles we are currently Renting and I'm pretty proud of myself for everything I went through to be where I am.  I have always wanted to be 25 by the time I was a homeowner and at least started in college I feel so depressed I work at a shity job getting shity pay but its a job.  I've been feeling really depressed lately and I don't know why I know I have anxiety which I have not been put on medication for.

Knowing that I don't have any close friends, besties, or good friendships that I long for. With just at least ONE person! No friends in life life, no close friendships online, Not even a girlfriend! It's actually been a couple months since a woman who was having an Affair relationship with me, ghosted me completely out of the blues after a year long nice relationship with her. Just poof, gone like that, she was talking about a future with me and being in love with me and everything. One of those ""too good to be true relationships"" which probably was! It felt very real though with everything we did together.  


But yeah, this feeling of loneliness is quite daunting on me now.  
I wake up just unmotivated (Have been for a couple months since she ghosted me) and feel myself dragging my feet to work every day that I do go to work. It's not a high paying job, I'm 31 years old  and live with my mother, I love my kind and sweet and amazing family to death and I'm blessed to have them but I just have no other deep/close connection with a woman like I want or don't have any good friendships with anyone outside of family.

I am a very introverted person and I have social anxiety too. I cannot participate or be around in a group setting. I'd rather be with somebody 1-1 by ourselves and have the attention all to myself. I use Discord and I am in some really friendly servers/a guild for an online game, but I just find myself not saying hello to anyone on any of these servers. Like, I don't know what the heck is wrong with me! I am in some **truly** friendly and kind servers and just can't bring myself to even say hello to them.

And, I have tried to respond to like, women's R4R posts on Reddit, and different areas too. And when I do type a message to them, it's always unique and I'm just being me and such, but yeah no.. I just don't ever get a response back. And that sucks too! Especially when you find someone that you think you may really like! And they just don't respond. I tend to just get that a lot, so I'm used to it by now.  
But, I still respond to posts/profiles/etc. after reading their posts/profiles and responding to them uniquely. Like, finding something I like on their profiles and using that as a first message. Nope, still no message back from them.

One thing I do have to mention though, I'm chubby/large (But want to lose weight soon!)  
And I was born with what people usually call me ""the ugly genes"" I was born with the ugly genes they say. ""**you look nothing alike your sister, your sister is smoking sexy!**"" they say. I tend to try to avoid describing to women what I look like and such in our beginning messages, but, sometimes I just feel that it really needs to be said so that they get an idea of what I'll look like and I'm not wasting my time if they truly go for looks.  
Don't get me wrong, I love myself and I'm super confident about myself. I'm just letting you know what it's been going on. Like, showing a picture of my **recent** self to a woman and they ghost me/block me/etc. RIGHT away. Must be my face or something.

Anyways, it's time for me to get to work.  
If you have read through this whole thing, I appreciate it! I needed all that off my chest and I hope that somebody will listen and care!

My mom only comes home during weekends because of her job also. I dont blame them though, i still love them very much. But without having someone to talk to when i was young shaped me of who i am as a person. I became socially awkward, shy, weak, and an  unconfident person. I also play games a lot, that made my childhood memorable and happy.

From kindergarten up to now that im senior high, i have been to 6 different schools because of me being lazy and an unresponsible student. I did have many friends, but i think none of them are true to me. My bestfriends changed from time to time because like what i've said, i kept on transferring to other different schools. But none of my friendships worked. My primary school bestfriend does not talk to me anymore, my middle school bestfriend and me didnt work out so well because we had the same crush which is fine with me but they did not ended up being together anyway 😂, and then now that im on adulthood stage, i also realized that my long time friend just used me because he only calls me when he needs me, i got his back everytime when he needs something but when i am the one who needs help it doesnt seem that he really cared for me after all (i only realized it during quarantine started lol and before coronavirus we had an argument) and then now he is trying to hit on my ex-girlfriend like wtf bro have some little respect for me atleast you used me for years bruh haha. Quarantine made me realized that i dont have real friends at all despite the fact that i've been with so many people. Because even when im with my friends back then, i am that boring and non talkative friend, i am just a listener everytime. So i've come to that point that maybe having friends is just not for me, i am just a boring kid who does wanna play games all the time. Even though everytime i always try to be that cool and a good listener for my friends. (I just hate small talk hahaha and im a very quiet person) 

Now i'm learning to be happy without having any friends. Now i'm learning to survive in this journey called life without having friends.

It was a really bad relationship like I’d cut off all my friends I had and just let myself rot away with drug addictions, just letting my whole life revolve around her it was really bad and ended with me finding out the baby inside her was not mine at 6 weeks. After that I urged my mum to move down to another state where my dad was living which she was pretty happy to do because we have moved around most our life anyway and there was nothing left for our family there. Anyway I had been smoking weed everyday when we moved here for a fair while but about 3/4 months ago I’ve lost track at this point I managed to quit for a while and start boxing which I love soo much definitely was on the way to changing my life and I had so much motivation. But then the restrictions got a lot stricter in the state I am currently living in, probably about 3-4 weeks ago maybe longer and it’s just so hard man.

I have friends, some close, some more ""hi/bye"" type, a family that likes me, but I've always been that loner who's always alone to weddings or other social events. I just can't form this type of deep connection that I crave.

There's nothing that I want more but the conviction that I'm not good enough for it, that it's something for better people (everyone but myself) is even stronger than this need. I feel like an alien that was sent to earth to survey humans, who has caught an unbearable feeling of isolation. I am mortified to even communicate this need for companionship, even now in complete anonymity I am shaking with embarrassment. I have kinda build this facade around me that I am good alone, that I don't need this companionship that everyone else has, in order to both stay safe from embarrassing questions and keep myself sane by lying to myself with it. It has become unbearable, my chronic loneliness has manifested itself in actual physical pain, it feels like a weight lying on  my chest constantly.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have so little self-esteem left that I can't even manage to look (let alone give a smile) at strangers anymore. And when I do I'm convinved their thought process is something like ""Ew did he really just look at me? Smile at me? What a gross sack of shit""

Seriously,  fuck this. I'm not a desperate case, so don't judge me right away. In  fact I never knew I'd end up posting here coz I had hope. Doing this  quickly coz I've got stuff I gotta get back to. If you've got 3 minutes  to read this, I appreciate it then.

I  just want to be explained the situation, by people of my age (between  20 and 25) who've already deeply thought about it. I moved from my  native country to a new country with the hope that I could meet  different, great people. I'm studying Business Administration now. My  best friend's depressed and is not going back to college anytime soon.  Even though I'm trying to do my best on my side, I can't drag him up. I  slowly lost most of my friends in my country. So, seeing how hope was  fraying, I chose to set sail to seek a new life, and to find the desire  to live again. However, it doesn't seem to be turning out that way even.

Why  are all people of our age f\*cking fake? Like, we're young. We have our  whole bloody life ahead of us, and that means a whole lot of  opportunities. And to make things happen, we've got to do it together,  and there's no other way around. I'm not pretentious enough to say I can  become self-made, cuh' no one's self made. Without any other people,  you ain't shih'. And yet everybody be acting fake to the deep bloody  core, like it's going to ""save"" them. I understand that at our age, most  people already have their 'friend base'. But still...

Today  I was watching Elon Musk's advice to be successful, and he mentioned  having great people by your side. How am I supposed to find them? I'm  now trying my best to be myself, stop being overly unconfident and try  to think positively.

I understand  making friends takes time and all that stoopid stuff, but how can you  even start making friends when people block you at square 1, with that  typical behaviour 80% of young people have now.

I've  seen a therapist for 2 years, understood lots of things. But still, I'm  young, so it's hard. And my brain is kind of too complicated.

So,  in the end, how am I supposed to finally find those ""great people""? Is  it even possible to make good friends after 20yo in our era? Does aiming  for a great career and life mean giving up on meeting our soulmates ?  (both friends and gf?)

548,GreenTinkertoy,1600929312,1,"I have struggled with severe depression over the past seven years, since I was twelve years old. I also have diagnosed anxiety and OCD, along with Alcohol Use Disorder and Cannabis Use Disorder. At my worst, I had six suicide attempts over a period of three months. Going back some years, I had another. I have seven total suicide attempts at 19 years old.


I spent $1600 on my therapy that I so desperately needed and learned that there is hope, even when I don’t believe it. I still struggle at times, but I know I’m strong enough to get out of it, and for the first time in my life, I like myself. I’ve been sober nearly 10 months, cut out all the negative people, and really found hope. I have a new outlook on life.


What triggered the most severe depression I had was the ending of an abusive relationship. While our time together was short, the feelings were indescribable. They were stronger and more beautiful than anything else I’ve ever felt. Like I mentioned, it was still abusive, and, at times, I still am affected by the traumas I had in the relationship. I’ve realized that I don’t need her, and she doesn’t deserve me.


But even after I’ve gotten my life together, there’s still one thing I feel like I’m missing


Intimacy


Romantic intimacy specifically. I spent a very long time wanting a girlfriend and being desperate about it that, even when there were plenty of red flags, I dated someone who manipulated me. I get this feeling sometimes. Though, it’s different. Now it’s a sort of wanting the same intimacy I had with my ex. Yes, it was abusive, but there were moments that were truly happy.


Yeah, sex is cool and all, but that’s not even close to my favorite thing about a relationship. It’s the vulnerability and the safety you feel with being vulnerable, with being yourself. The feeling I describe is the feeling of being one.


My favorite thing to do with my ex was when she would lay her head on my chest, we’d lay down in bed, and fall asleep together.


I believe that is the peak of love.


You feel one in that moment. You are no longer these separate entities, but you are one conjoined force that is stronger than anything the world throws at you. In that moment, the true emotion of love is most apparent, as you both lay down touching and drifting away into your dreams. You can even drift into these dreams without being asleep. In fact, those are the dreams that really exemplify what you want with this person. This person, the one that consistently makes you feel like ever moment is better than the last.


I’ve changed my life. I have overcome a lot. I feel I’ve been to hell and back and have been told that by other people. I am truly happy with the person I am, and as much as I don’t feel it sometimes, I don’t want to be anyone other than me. I am a changed and hopeful person.


But I still want that intimacy.


The intimacy that feels like it is unattainable because oh how little people see you and difficulty making connections.

I've went thru puberty like half way. I'm seeing mostly positive changes. I feel like I'm getting accepted now and I feel more happier now. There's this girl I like her names Chelsea, she's in my design class. I've asked her out before in grade 7-8 and people bullied me for asking her out and she didn't give me a straight answer on whether she wanted to date me or not. So I stopped trying half way thru grade 8 and now I'm in grade 10 and I feel more confident in myself. She's complimented me a few times since she saw these changes, but I can't tell if she's hinting for me to ask her again or just being her friendly self.

Yesterday I got a message from one of my very few friends who I haven't seen since around March, she said that she's moving to Georgia on the 5th, and I'm gonna miss her. I still remember when we first met, one person was annoying her in our algebra class so she moved seats, and me being the loner I was, had a few empty seats around me. So she ends up sitting next to me, we didn't think much of each other at first, but after a week or two, we became friends, we even had a few other classes together. After a while I developed feelings for her which she found out about, she felt the same way, but she was going through a lot, she even said that I helped her stopped herself from commiting suicide, and she helped me be more social and comfortable as myself, so we just stayed friends. And now she's leaving, and it feels like a part of me is leaving too, I know that sounds corny but it's true, when we talked yesterday we were both sad, I wonder if we'll meet again and I'll have a chance to be together. Honestly, it feels like the universe did this to me on purpose, give me a chance at love then take it away.

569,hopelesslonelygay,1600915938,1,"I must have opened and closed the Reddit app on my phone 20 times before writing this post. It seems like the rate of responses vary wildly on here with the hour of the day or which community is posted to, so it's entirely possible that no one will even see this and that thought kind of devastated me when thinking about posting about my feelings to Reddit. Experience is making it hard for me to believe that anyone will care about my feelings or what I have to say even if it is seen, but I don't really know what else to do. I'm not in a good place and I don't have another outlet at the moment. I may cross post this so sorry if you see it more than once and are bothered by that.

It used to be when waking up, I would feel better than I did when I went to sleep and that would last at least a few hours, but now almost every day, even after getting to talk with one of the very few friends who seem to have time and the inclination to talk to me since the pandemic started to wear everyone down so much the day before, I just wake up feeling suicidal. I feel motivation and passion for anything very rarely and when I do it's gone before I can gather the strength to latch onto it and try to at least have a distraction from how badly I feel unless that motivation is for passive dopamine hits like checking social media, tv, food, or porn.

No one reaches out to me. All my friends and family live with someone, either romantic partners or family, and no one has any motivation or desire to reach out to me during this pandemic because they have so little energy and what little they have is taken up by work or school or just how tough life is right now for everyone. I don't begrudge them feeling that way, but none of them are isolated like I am and they seem to be satisfied with their interactions with their partners or family whom they live with. I won't go so far to say that I have no one, I have at very least a couple very good friends whom I get to talk with a couple times a month each, but it's really not enough. My best days pre-pandemic seemed to be when I had at least three social interactions with different people per day. Now I'm getting nothing almost. When I reach out, when I say I'm having a problem, when I say explicitly this is what's going on and this is what I need, I am met with resistance, passitivity, and am kept at arm's length. People have to set healthy boundaries for themselves and look out for themselves before they can help others, but I need more support than what I'm getting. I have tried to check up on most of my closer social circle several times since the pandemic started in March, and I can only think of a few scant instances where those same people initiated contact with me to check on how I was doing, even after weeks or months of no communication. I feel like I have to threaten self harm to get anyone to care just for a second, and then they disappear immediately anyway.

There are a handful of men in my life whom I've developed feelings for over the years, half of whom I've told and not been accepted but not been outright rejected either and have then been encouraged, explicitly or implicitly, to flirt or make passes at them or they will flirt and make passes at me, but they never follow through with romance or lust or they will occasionally but then immediately get freaked out and retreat. The other half I'm terrified that if I told them it would destroy our friendship and quite possibly an entire social circle for me, which is especially terrifying because I have made it a policy in life to only keep close those who I feel a genuine connection and friendship with, so my friend list is limited, despite having many acquaintances whom I enjoy and hope to develop a deeper friendship with. Even the ones whom I have not told sometimes flirt with me, have sent sexual pictures, have kissed me with tongue in public, and it's all very confusing. I can't know for sure if they are confused sexually themselves, if they feel pity for me, or even if they can be trusted to tell themselves the truth and not rewrite their history so as to be comfortable in their image of heterosexuality they put forth and therefore if they can be trusted to tell me the truth of what they feel. Sometimes they talk about their feelings or attraction to me and then deny it later. Their gaslighting behavior and our relationships have caused me to feel paranoid about men a lot of the time, which was something I have struggled with ever since puberty, so my male friends I have are rare and very precious to me. Even when I reach out and try to instigate contact with new guys on apps or whatnot, I feel like I get ignored the vast majority of the time. No one seems to want to actually have a deeper conversation, be that about our individual feelings, our society, academic type critique of media or arts, or even how our days were. I still feel a deep connection and affection for the previously mentioned men who are a part of my life whom I have feelings for, but their gay panic always seems to derail things despite the signals they give off and their actions that say that they are attracted to and hold affection for me. I just never seem to be enough for them to follow through.

I'm feeling very hopeless right now. I have dreams and aspirations I wish I could focus on or care about, but the lack of human attention and support has made me a lump on the couch with no interests or trust for new relationships, platonic or romantic. This is not new/caused by the pandemic, but it has been immensely amplified by it.

I feel as though if I could have more social support, be it romantic or friendship, if I could feel that consistency and support, I would be able to put my energy and concentration into the projects and dreams and aspirations I have that don't involve dating or having a family of my own. But I am just so lonely and depressed and without a good support system, that I am emotionally raw all the time and I cannot concentrate on or conjure up motivation for any kind of endeavor, even basic health and upkeep of myself or my home most of the time. I try to focus on and be grateful for the good things in my life, the fact that I have a home, that I have food, that I am able to acquire what medication I need, that I am fortunate enough to be able to make occasional frivolous purchases just for fun, and not have to choose between an appetizer or dessert when I order in, but what is any of that worth without friends, family, or a romantic partner?

570,WhatsTheP0intOfItAll,1600914781,1,"Im starting to feel extra lonely and depressed when im ""alone""... I know that sounds stupid but hear me out. 

I hang out with people almost everyday, I have close friends, acquaintances, workmates, study partners, that I see every day. I'm sort of the glue that holds a lot of them together socially. If someone I know, knows someone else I know, 99% of the time I introduced them. On paper, i'm really not a lonely guy (friends wise, not romantically, i'm a lost cause there), but I sure as hell feel like it. While I'm hanging out with people, doing work with people, going to the gym with people ect I feel mostly OK but there is still a sort of ""Cloud"" over me now-a-days. Its been going on for about the past year and I cant seem to find why. This ""Cloud"" of moderate sadness was constant and didn't really change day to day... But now when i'm alone, it has gotten so much worse than just a cloud. Its a empty pit in my stomach that makes me feel like I haven't interacted with anyone in years, but It could be 10mins after my friends leave. It makes no sense. I just sit in my room and either do my work or just listen to depressing music and think about nothing/awful things. I have no clue if this makes sense, but I hope it does.

571,No_Plum7370,1600914253,1,I used to be super close to one friend. Unfortunately we got split up for about one and a half years and during that time i tried a few times to strike up a conversation but each attempt failed. We even met up once or twice and at first it would go well and then eventually she would leave/start talking with her other friends. After the time apart i found out she was going to be at the same school. I would always say hi when i saw her but she never seemed to notice me around campus. She was my best friend but now we barely talk and each time i see her i wonder what i could have done to keep her close. It hurts a lot knowing that shes even closer to some of my own friends than she is to me even though i tried to connect again.

572,actualperson362,1600913484,1,"after seeing the person I like at work being playful and friendly with someone else when he could never do that with me. Although he is very sweet and polite to me, he also keeps it strictly professional and is sometimes even a little awkward with me and/or avoids me. I think I've invented something in my fantasies that was never there, simply because I find him wonderful to behold (he is very cute) and he was very kind, polite and supportive to me during a time where I really needed some basic affection and softness from someone. However, I think maybe he can tell that I've taken a liking to him and he doesn't reciprocate, so he now avoids me to subtly reject any possible advances. My humor is a little dry and sarcastic, but I have tried to joke around with him to a response of complete silence lol. Furthermore, I called him sweet and he responded by telling me to have myself a nice evening. :'D  

Admittedly I do think the awkward energy is my fault for avoiding him on purpose, as simply seeing him would fill my heart with anxiety and I didn't know what to do or say, but now I think it is best to move on. I think if someone likes you, they'll make it obvious and you won't have to mull over it in your head and dream about them. Although the dreams were nice (one of which featured a very vivid french kiss), they are just dreams.  

I guess I'm posting this here as I am currently a little lonely, and I want to know what it feels like to be held tightly in a pair of strong arms lol.

I live with my family, I meet with friends frequently, I interact with people I genuinely like but would not consider friends on social media once in a while. I started a new job and I have lovely, engaging coworkers. And yet i feel so alone. 

I thought perhaps getting a boyfriend would solve it. I don't know, never had one, so won't hurt to try right. So I downloaded some dating apps at the beginning of the pandemic. I had some riveting conversations. Some chill casual ones. I received unsollicited dickpics. Endlessly flirted for fun. I bantered around with quite a few. While of course no actual date came out of it, I thought I had at least learned to interact better with guys. Now with my new job it would be too risky to download these apps again, or at least that's what I say to convince myself.

Anyways then I thought it was just me and perhaps getting a dog would solve where I put all this restless energy and devotion. I sure was sick and tired of spending time with myself. But this train of thought I cut off fairly soon. It wouldn't be fair to a dog if I could not give it a whole and fulfilling life. I still lack the stability both financially and at home. It would be irresponsible. 

I have focused on myself and tried to discover new hobbies.  But nothing has stuck so far because I lack the commitment and drive, and desire a social component. I graduated this year during a global pandemic, and lost my final chance of experiencing student life fully and independently. But oh well, I do not drink or smoke anyways, so I am sure I am an absolute riot at parties.

I want to blame this loneliness on my living situation but I know deep down that this small village is not what is holding me back. I work fulltime, study part time with plenty of groupwork, I work an additional job in services. I socialize plenty. It is myself for whatever reason. I regret so many choices I made, however insignificant, which made me lose out on experiences. 

When I pretend to be introspective I blame this loneliness on my insecurities; physical attraction, humor, confidence, coming across smart, fear of rejection and failure, overstepping. I have become hyperaware of myself and overanalyze.

Killing myself would only hurt people that erroneously feel bound to me, which due to my problems is pretty much only family. But that is enough. I would be even worse than I am if I ended my life.

So it’s best to accept my path. Be the best person I can be considering how worthless I am knowing it will yield no reward. Nothing besides me being less of a harmful force in the universe. Continue knowing that I will be alone. That I will never have friends. That I will never have a girlfriend. That I will be miserable because I am no good. Never expect anything from anyone. I am not worth it. Never ask anything from anyone. I do not deserve anything. Get through life one day at a time. Find my way to managing my depression enough that suicide is unlikely while remaining honest with myself about what I deserve and what my prospects are. Abandon false hope, it fuels depression in the long run. Be honest. 

I will die the best death I can die. And then it will be over. That is the best way for me.

I don’t deserve anything better.",lonely,I don’t deserve a girlfriend. I don’t deserve children. Best for me to just live the best life I can live with what I have and never ask anything from anyone again,2020-09-24 08:12:23

Okay, most of the serotonin is created in our gut and low serotonin can mean us not wanting to socialise or be depressed or have low self esteem. If our gut isn't healthy we won't be able to create the serotonin as well as we should.

To boost gut health we need to reduce sugar and eat more vegetables so we get the fibre the gut needs.

I was never allowed to take up any extracurriculars, even though I really wanted. I remember that I was once in a DIY group when I was a primary schooler, but not for long. I got a C at Maths and I was immediately taken out of the class.

When I went on to high school, I wanted to join a girl scout club/program. I was very hyped when I went home that day, and told my parents. Of course, they never let me join.

Meanwhile, I was bullied by kids in my class.

The only extracurricular that they let me join was piano, but that's a lonely hobby.

## Bonedog

a poem by Eva H.D.

\[transcribed from its appearance in the film *I’m Thinking of Ending Things* (w/d Charlie Kaufman, 2020)\]

\_\_\_

Coming home is terrible  
whether the dogs lick your face or not;  
whether you have a wife   
or just a wife-shaped loneliness waiting for you.  
Coming home is terribly lonely,  
so that you think   
of the oppressive barometric pressure   
back where you have just come from  
with fondness,  
because everything’s worse   
once you’re home.

You think of the vermin   
clinging to the grass stalks,  
long hours on the road,  
roadside assistance and ice creams,  
and the peculiar shapes of   
certain clouds and silences  
with longing because you did not want to return.  
Coming home is   
just awful.

And the home-style silences and clouds   
contribute to nothing   
but the general malaise.  
Clouds, such as they are,   
are in fact suspect,   
and made from a different material   
than those you left behind.  
You yourself were cut   
from a different cloudy cloth,  
returned,  
remaindered,  
ill-met by moonlight,  
unhappy to be back,  
slack in all the wrong spots,  
seamy suit of clothes  
dishrag-ratty, worn.

You return home  
moon-landed, foreign;  
the Earth’s gravitational pull  
an effort now redoubled,  
dragging your shoelaces loose   
and your shoulders  
etching deeper the stanza   
of worry on your forehead.  
You return home deepened,  
a parched well linked to tomorrow   
by a frail strand of…

Anyway…

You sigh into the onslaught of identical days.  
One might as well, at a time…

Well…  
Anyway…  
You’re back.

The sun goes up and down   
like a tired whore,  
the weather immobile   
like a broken limb  
while you just keep getting older.  
Nothing moves but   
the shifting tides of salt in your body.  
Your vision blears.  
You carry your weather with you,  
the big blue whale,  
a skeletal darkness.

You come back  
with X-ray vision.  
Your eyes have become a hunger.  
You come home with your mutant gifts  
to a house of bone.  
Everything you see now,  
all of it:  
bone.",lonely,I am thinking about ending things - poem from the movie,2020-09-24 05:21:03
605,printlineHelloWorld,1600888763,1,I moved a couple hours away from the town I’ve spent most of my adult in and where my closest friends all live.  I took a new job which was much needed and that is much more rewarding and enjoyable so in that aspect I’m much happier than I was.  I have my own place now and no longer have a roommate so the privacy and atmosphere I have now are enjoyable as well.  The problem is that I didn’t have many close friends to begin with and now that I’m away from them I don’t see/talk to them much anymore.  One of them has even distanced himself from me recently citing “being busy and having a lot going on” as his reason for not answering texts from me.  We used to text each other about twice a week and have a brief conversation about what we’ve been up to but that has stopped now.  My old roommate who has been my best friend and who I treat as a brother doesn’t answer my calls or texts much anymore either.  I feel like some of them are even jealous of the progress I’ve made even though they pushed me to go for this opportunity and better myself.  Nobody calls or texts me unless I initiate the conversation.  I’m happy but at the same time very lonely and I don’t see that changing anytime soon because of COVID.  If anyone wants to talk feel free to send me a message to my inbox.  I’m a gamer and don’t have ppl to play games with on Xbox either so if you’re interested in doing so send me your gamertag in a personal message.

607,sadoilerboi,1600887353,1,"I’m so lonely. I’ve wanted a girlfriend for many years now, but it still hasn’t happened yet. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong either. I don’t want to come across as narcissistic or vain or anything like that, but I genuinely think I’m an interesting and kind person, one who’d be a fantastic boyfriend. I’m definitely average looking, but everyone I know thinks I’m a great person, and I don’t think I live in an echo chamber about this either. I have a lot of friends, have great family and am fairly personable as a whole, not shy really at all. I went through high school just accepting that there aren’t enough people there to find a girl for me, as I went to a small school. No problem, I thought, university would be better! Obviously because of the pandemic I’ve really been screwed by this, and can only meet people in general in my faculty, one that is known for having a skewed gender ratio. And because of this, I feel bad for the girls in my program as they probably get pressured a lot to date by all these guys who are in similar situations to me. I try and am trying to make friends with lots of people, but I don’t see the connection with anyone there. Since I’m 18, obviously I’ve tried dating apps, but I hardly get any matches at all, if any on certain apps. And all of those do not pan out at all, I’ve maybe gotten 2 legitimate responses this whole year. Everyone keeps telling me, “there’s a girl for you out there” but it seems so hopeless. I know I could be a great boyfriend who would be there for her through everything, but it seems like no girls want to do the same with me. I don’t mean to be a doomer or whatever, it’s just how I feel sometimes. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know why I posted this, I just needed to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading.

Even lost a lot of my ambitions, because what's the point of being ambitious if I'll always be alone anyway? It's not like I've got anyone to share my success with, and I definitely won't need to support anyone besides me and maybe my future pets, so it's not like I need to make a lot of money.

But then it feels super selfish to talk about. I mean, for one, this is obviously a super tiny problem in the grand scheme of things. And beyond that, I’ve always been taught that talking about your birthday is like demanding presents and attention, and I don’t want to be that person.

For full disclosure she is a third year and I’m a first, above that she knows it’s a very bad idea for flatmates to get romantically involved so this crush turned immediately into a ball of crushing anxiety since this was not good news since this was very likely to not happen and cause a lot of awkwardness if things got out 

The thing is me and this girl both are on the spectrum so she’s someone who can just get me, neaurotypical people can always understand but very rarely and someone truly know what it’s like unless you’ve lived your whole life with it and I think this is what caused so much strong attraction and why it hurts so much to not be able to get that because it feels so rare to find people who can make me feel that way. 

And in the state of manic joy, sadness and anxiety I’ve been through the past few days I think I’ve reached a point of clarity through it all, the point of all this pain inside of me: I want this person because I need someone who can be empathetic of the struggle of being autistic but also because if I am going to date anyone I need them to be able to support me through it because I’ve spent 18 years sailing this boat through stormy waters and I don’t know how much longer I can steer it upwards before the storm just sinks me

662,throwaway17171717179,1600819604,1,"I’ve been depressed for the majority of my life because of my disconnected family and how I have no siblings.  I grew up most of my life with on in person parent, while I was raised by the other over the phone because they work and live in another state.  As a result, I’m not a very social person and I struggled to make connections in my childhood and teenage years.  It’s also unfortunate that my childhood best friends are fuck bois who have criminal records.

Because of my low socio-economic background, I was motivated to work hard in high school to climb the social ladder and go to a prestigious school.  I sacrificed my social life as a result, especially taking the hardest possible course loads and a shit ton of time studying for the SAT.  I only hung out with friends outside of academics and extracurriculars maybe two times. That paid off, since now I’m attending an Ivy League school as a freshman.

However, I feel very isolated from my family members and it was only until recently I told them about my mental health problems.  Since middle school, I’ve told them absolutely nothing and I regret not telling them sooner.  

I have had a girlfriend once, but that was only in senior year of high school.  And it only lasted about 2 or 3 months before she broke up with me and started dating another guy within the next week.  She was the only person that I was able to connect since middle school with and made me confident in my social abilities.

I feel so broken.  I don’t feel very close to many people.  All I want in life is a girl friend, some one who I can connect with.  Someone who I can have fun with me, and someone who would always be there for me no matter what.  I’ve been on two dates recently, and I didn’t seem like I would be able to connect to them.  Im not sure if I would be able to find someone that would be perfect for me ;-;

And college has been kicking my fucking ass recently.  I haven’t been able to find much free time for my self, and it’s making my depression very bad.  I feel like I want to sleep forever and not have to wake up to any responsibilities.  No, I don’t have plans for suicide, but I do have suicidal thoughts almost every hour of my existence now.

Here is a summary of me:

I like to play video games, which I’ve been doing since childhood.  I have an Xbox One, but I haven’t been able to play it since I’ve been so busy with college.  I hadn’t played a video games in like a month, and that’s the longest I haven’t played a game for in my entire life.

667,MikeC337,1600817010,1,"Ending up alone... I’m 22 years old and that’s still my greatest fear. It started in childhood. When people I once trusted treated me as irrelevant. Or how overtime the friendships I made would slowly fade away. Or how even my own family would leave me behind for “something better” There came to be this nagging thought. What if that is how my life is supposed to turn out? I would see others around me finding a place to belong. Where they were wanted and accepted for who they were. But it seemed so distant. Beyond my reach or understanding. 

When I grasped the concept of what love is and how wonderful it could be to experience it. It was something I craved. Yearned for. But every potential relationship I’ve ever had always fell apart. Sooner or later that was the outcome. 

And I would fight it. Fighting and not giving in. Never accepting how shitty things can be was my nature. I would think to myself - 
No. I’ll never give up. Somehow I will find the one. The person who will understand me. Who could be my missing piece to the sad puzzle that is my life. My other half... 

Some day... I will feel whole. Finally. Then all the struggle. All the pain would be worth it. Because I’d finally be happy.

Yet...day after day... week after week...month after month...year after year... 

My resolve got weaker and weaker. Rejection after rejection. No matter how hard I tried. No matter what I’d do. I was just never good enough. Or attractive enough. It even got to the point where I’d settle for whoever came my way. For anyone who showed interest even if they weren’t the right kind of person. I would reason that it was better than being alone. Only to find out how wrong I was. The dreaded, horrible and aching loneliness persisted.

Then COVID happened....

Any hope of meeting someone by accident or by pursuit vanished. Another year is almost over and everyone talks about being lonely or suffering from isolation. But for me... it’s almost normal.

Because that has been my life for years and seeing others succeed where I have not. Feeling jealous and envious of others who made it. 

It’s like living in your own personal hell. The torment seems endless and sometimes its all you dwell on. 

I’ve wanted to find love and worked for it harder than anything else in my life. Only it didn’t matter.

I am never anyone’s choice... 😔

And I keep getting the same bullshit from people I try to confide in. 

“Oh don’t worry it’ll happen when you least expect it.” 

“You’re a catch. You just haven’t met the person who sees it yet”  

or “There are plenty of fish in the sea.”

Yes! There are plenty!!! Just not for me.

And sometimes I don’t know if I can take it anymore... it’s become a poison to my soul.

So should I let go and give up on my dreams? Or should I find a way to hang on?...

668,VoltageKid56,1600816934,1,"Ever since I started college back in 2017 I’ve been struggling with isolation. In the time since then I’ve only managed to make 1 new friend by myself and she just disappeared one day a year later (no idea what happened). All my close friends from high school either went to different colleges, started working, joined the military, or are only on campus sometimes. I used to hang out with a guy I knew from high school every week after he pushed me join his church small group. The only reason I joined was just because I wanted to be able to talk to people again. Now there are only two other people in the group I’m in and we don’t really talk meet/talk anymore due to the pandemic and my friend from high school graduated early. 

My close friends from high school and I still talk in a group chat, but now they don’t really text much. There are times where I try to get a conversation started but usually I’ll only get one basic reply if anything. I know they are busy with their own lives, but it feels at times like I’m just holding onto a relationship that doesn’t really exist anymore. I know that sometimes friends just fall apart, but that isn’t easy for me. Most of my friends have their own jobs, got in better shape, apartments, drive their own cars, made new friends at their jobs and then theirs me: a 21 year old overweight virgin who still lives at home, hasn’t learned to drive yet, and is struggling to maintain barley passing grades in college. My friends are managing to act like normal functioning human beings and while I’m not even a fraction of the person I used to be in high school.

Because of the pandemic, all of my classes were moved online so most of the week I sit alone in my college apartment with no actual human from the moment my parents drop me off here on Sunday afternoon to Thursday afternoon when they take me back home provided that I don’t spend the weekend here too. Even if I didn’t talk much with other people in class before the virus, at least I got to be around other people for a moment, instead of being completely isolated in the only place safe from the virus on campus for me. Most days I just wake up, lay on a pallet in ground of the tv, and listen to my classes on zoom, get up a few hours latter and eat a small meal in another likely soon to fail attempt to lose weight without going outside to exercise (The campus gym recently has someone test positive for the virus and I don’t want to risk it. The only other jogging field near by is almost half an hour’s walk away), then lay back in front of the tv until I work up the energy to get up and go to bed so I can do the same thing again tomorrow.

I used to think that I was the kind of person who could cope well with isolation, but now I realized I was wrong. I feel both empty and tired all the time. I don’t even feel motivated to do basic things like my schoolwork no matter how important it is or take out the trash. I realize most people who say stuff like this are often borderline suicidal, but that’s NOT ME. I just genuinely feel both completely lost and stuck in place at the same time with no idea what I’m supposed to do. It doesn’t help that I also have what I believe to be pure o OCD that is mostly untreated other than the generic anti anxiety meds I take. I’ve tried explaining this to my parents but they act like it’s no big deal and not a debilitating mental issue that has helped ruin my life.

At this point, I honestly don’t know what else I’m supposed to do. Forgot at my mental issues, at this point I feel like I don’t really even have anyone to talk to in general. I’ve tried to fix things myself (my weight, my mental health, my grades, ect) for so long and failed again and again and again and at this point I so tired and at time feel like I don’t know how I can keep going. Like I said before, I’M NOT SUICIDAL, I’m just so fucking tired of trying and failing on repeat. Before this stupid bat virus hit, at least I had a moments where I could be around others in hopes I could pretend things were okay for a moment. Now I’m just alone with these issues 24/7.

I honestly don’t even know why I’m typing this. It’s not like I’m looking for sympathy or anything, I guess I tried everything else so I might as well try this. Maybe i just wanted to vent this to someone other than the voice in my head that won’t shut the fuck up. I’m probably posting this on the wrong subreddit and even if this is right one, it’s not like it matters. I really doubt that little to anyone will actually read this or care.

671,princesspootlovato,1600812860,1,"Things will get better for you. To whoever is reading this, I hope this will give you hope. 

This whole quarantine has been a shit show for me; I’ve lost 2 of my closest “friends” that I thought I was going to spend my whole life with. This is literally a breakup. Like most females, we talked about when we would get our first boyfriends, our future weddings, our future kids being best friends, etc. Well after going through hell and back with these girls I never thought we would stop being friends. I’m still hurting inside and it has taken a toll on my mental health, but I know I will heal. I was worried about being alone for the longest time and I constituted my happiness to being friends with these girls, when I should be finding happiness with myself. 

The problem with breakups in an era of social media is the fact that people never post the negative aspects of their lives. You see people thriving on a daily and that’s just not reality. I unfollowed them as a way to heal. I didn’t need a daily reminder that they were doing better off without me. (And I know that would post things for me to deliberately see and react to, so I erased all that toxic energy out of life.)

Looking back, I kept making excuses for their actions, but this was hurting me even more. I kept telling myself that they would never do that to me, but they DID and I have to get over it. For all I know, they didn’t give two flying fucks about me and that was my problem. I gave too many fucks. So now I’m teaching myself to not give any fucks!

I truly still wish the best for these girls even after all the shit they have done to me. We were all in the wrong, but hey, we are humans who make mistakes. 

 I’m taking this as a life lesson and seeing this as apart of my growth. If they were destined to stay in my life, they would still be by my side, but they’re not. No friends equals no drama, which is true. Looking back, I did reconstruct my life around these girls, some of it being for the better and some for the worse. So now I’m focusing on myself and doing whatever the fuck I want with my life. This is a reminder to LOVE YOURSELF AND BE YOUR OWN BEST FRIEND. I know it’s hard to do when you feel really alone, but just know that I believe in you and millions of other people are going through similar situations.

I feel like most of the time you just have to prove you're not a creep. Everyone is just waiting for the other person to slip up and then they block.

693,SergalLiker,1600802108,1,"Hey! I *Hopefully can* assume i can write this here, about how i've felt for a long time, and a short lifestory with no identifying details. Just because it's getting late where i live, and i tend to get melancholic when it gets late. Listening to music that has melancholic lyrics, beat, way of the instruments playing, sending desperate messages to the small fair of people i consider friends. Thinking about my future and what once was. 

I was a active happy child in kindergarten, i had fun goofs and gaffs with my likeminded small-humen such i was. My grandparents were happy, my parents were happy, and my sister was energetic, happy and a good person i knew. I spent my free-time out of kindergarten playing games with my dad, and if i was """"sick"""", i did handicrafts with my mother. This went all the way until i got to school, and graduated my first baby-year in school with decent grades. Where i live, most of the residents are immigrants. I have nothing against them, never had any personal hatred against them, they're just as human as i am. I wasn't friends with any of them though. They kept to themselfes as i kept to myself and people from my ethnicity. As the immigrants often spoke in their own language, and i didn't wish to intrude their chatter by bringing myself into their friend-circles ((or whatever the word is)), 

The second year all of my friends that i knew, moved away to a different city, and the only person i noticed who didn't have friends was a russian. So i got to know him, as we both thought the same way. That we didn't wish to intrude their circle and cause them a problem while we spoke in a language we knew well, and they spoke in a broken manner. So we talked and we got each others' Steam accounts added into our friends! And we played every day, *or every day we didn't have any other plans.* 

Throughout my nine years of going to preschool, this friend of mine and mine relationship grew very distant, especially during the last three years. I was """"sick"""" often if i wasn't at school, and my own mental health dropped greatly. And i started being more agressive to this person, and i heavily regret it. 

During the last year i was as if a outsider to my class. I kept completely silent and almost completely just kept to myself. these symptoms developed from my second year to the very last one. And i often was my class' 'weakest link', i got picked on often verbally, and physically. And i sort of forwarded it only verbally to this person i considered my best friend for a few years before almost completely just ignoring him. He tried showing me memes and asked me about if i've been playing any games recently, and i just nodded it off. Thinking about dumb stuff that i did back then. And when i say that i forwarded the abuse to my friend verbally, i mean i just sticked to telling him off usually. Not in the most polite nor agressive manner. And i still to this day don't know if out of just feeling bad, or just attempting to dig into my life more, three girls from a neighboring class that were of my ethnicity started talking to me as if they'd known me for the entirety of my being in that school. And it genuinely made me feel sorta happy. Us four were on the last-graders' field trip together, and spent our recess' together. 

When the last day of school came upon, i felt like it was the doomsday in a way. But i also felt relieved. Knowing that the nine years i was alive, i WAS alive the least. We got our graduation papers, and my russian friend's mother walked into the classroom as i was the last one who got our papers, and i was trying to stuff it into my backpack. She was crying, and i grew concerned even more because i realized that i haven't seen him in school for the entire week. I shed a small tear, gave my teacher a hug, shed even bigger of a tear. Walked outside, and the three girls that've been with me were standing at the backdoor-corridoor i usually exited the school from. And as i was just about to leave, the nicest of the few said my name, i turned around  and she ran up to me and gave me a hug. 

I tried to keep a straight face, wished all of them farewells and good lucks as i walked out and started crying on my path home. Smoking multiple cigarettes before drying my eyes, and attempting to hide my eyes with a pair of sunglasses i never used before then. And stepped home. My parents asked if i was alright as i said the most unchalant ""Yep"" i've ever said in my life. Walked into my room, threw my graduate papers that were inside a letter on my table, and fell dead on my bed, and fell asleep near-instantly. 

I woke up at \~four as my mother cooked food and brought it into my room, i ate it, and started playing by my lonesome. And i saw that my russian friend was online, and messaged him if he was alright. He said his cat has just died that morning, and was off from school during the week to spend time with his cat. And asked if i was interested in drinking with him that night. I went over to his house, and we had small chatter inbetween the long akward pauses. In which i noticed that he had thrown a ton of tissues into his bin. After which i uncorked my own bottle and offered him some of mine, which he poured into his cola-glass, and gave it back to me. The night went awfully silent, us playing on his PS, giving off faint chuckles at random intervals. And eventually fell asleep.

We woke up at the same time to his mother having cooked breakfast and brought into his room. I ate it pretty fast, and as he slowly ate his own. I said in the most polite way i've talked to him in a long time that i'll go to my house, and we can play games. We played games the entire summer before our new schools started. He went into a college, and i went into a work-school. And we just completely started ghosting each other. 

It's been quite a few years now, i'm the same person i was on eight grade. A silent person keeping to himself. I dropped out from a school to enter another that interested me more. In which i still kept being the same me. But i've been thinking of my graduation day more every night for the few past weeks. And with having more mental issues hop on this wild ride. And my internet-social life lacking more than it was in pre-school, having had my first psychologist session, things haven't been going really nicely lately.

I had a love-relationship that lasted for a month, before i started ghosting the person because i felt it'd be too akward to tell him the reason why i wanted to break up. But at the same time i know that he knows why. And ever after that happened i've been having a ache in my heart for more friends i know face-to-face, or via the internet the least. Not to speak of the way i've been aching for a proper relationship me and the other'd to enjoy. And the way i've been eyeing my discord DMs and the way i've been hiding DMs with me and others because ""i've been too scared to talk to me"" make my conscious think that maybe my time's ticking up already this soon. Or that i shouldn't bother socializing with other people anymore.

And suddenly I noticed there were like 5 different groups of friends and I felt like literally everyone knows someone already. Like how do I make friends? It’s hard in lectures since you can’t talk during the lecture, there are like 80 people there anyway and then after the lecture everyone takes off god knows where. I’m so worried that I won’t make any friends. Nobody talked to me today and I didn’t have any proper opportunity to talk to someone. Also there aren’t any special interest activities nor clubs I could join in my college, that’s just not a thing where I live.

View them if you want more backstory. Basically all you need to know is that I had a crush on a girl from my class, she offered me a virtual hug which broke me emotionally, I then made a follow-up post saying that I even got her number. I followed that up with my fears and my dislike for the long term relationship idea. And now probably the finale to my brief story, one that ends in loneliness but on better terms than I started. So today I started to step up my efforts, I really doubled down on flirting and asking questions about my crush. I learned that we seemed even more compatible from a surface level. We are of similar age and like a lot of the same things. So I stepped up my flirts calling her pretty and smart, and funny and all of the things I really admired her for. She is super hard on herself so I was both trying to cheer her up but also deepen our friendship. I was building towards asking whether she had feelings towards me as well when she said we should do a zoom call for a bit. We ended up talking for well over 2 hours and it was almost everything I could have hoped for. We opened up about ourselves and it was great. She mentioned her past relationships and that she is now in a great relationship. Well, this broke my stride and we talked more about everything. Before we ended the conversation(she had to go let her dog out), I told her straight up how I felt. I wasn't issuing an ultimatum, I was just saying hey this is how I felt, you are still pretty, funny, and relatable and I would be glad to still be friends. Thankfully we haven't known each other for too long so it was awkward but not too bad. She took it really well and we agreed to remain friends. I am sad of course, I gained a friend so I shouldn't feel lonely but it still hurts. However, to anyone saying they aren't worth it or saying that life doesn't have a point I would just like to say one thing. I questioned the point of living before this moment. Why live? For a long period of time my only reasoning was because I needed to find a reason to live. There are plenty of reasons to live and this experience helped me realize that. My housemate made me fresh hot cocoa today, that was very nice. I woke up and watched the sunrise on the weekend. My best friend turned 20 and was very happy. I gained a friend recently. I saw the humanity of everything around me for the first time in a loooooooooong time. I saw the point. That is invaluable. So take a risk, it could end well and break you out of being down in the dumps.  Things could have gone better I suppose but I am pretty happy overall. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: A girl made me feel actual emotion for the first time in a long time, I misread the situation but it ended pretty well with me viewing myself and my life in a new way.",lonely,"Well, I guess I am sort of back to square one... this sucks.",2020-09-22 17:49:52
703,Matei-PB,1600759692,1,"I was so lonely. I had absolutely zero friends and when i tried to contact someone they just ignored me. I sat at home most of the time feeling like shit. 

Now i have tons of friends and a 10/10 girlfriend. Literally everything is going well, even my business is heading in the right direction. 

What i did to reach this point was i simply stopped giving a fuck. I stopped sobbing like a little baby about how lonely i am. I put myself in situations that normally cause anxiety in me. I simply thought what doesent kill you makes you stronger. 

One thing i noticed is that loneliness is a way to control you. When you feel lonely you seek acceptance from others. When i let go of the fear of being alone then others started seeking acceptance from me.

Read for an elder on the phone, help with meals on wheels.  Grab a bag and spend an hour picking trash.  There are Myriad volunteer opportunities and they will all put you in touch with a side of society who will appreciate you and any efforts. 

And guys, listen up: Animal Rescue.  (Single women think that single men who help with animal rescue are fabulous, and they would be right, especially after you join them, and even Quasimoto could get laid after  rescuing a litter of puppies...for reals)

If only they knew the torture of having to accept a life of solitude. The pain that comes with being unaccepted, unheard or rejected for one reason or another. 
Nights grow colder the more alone we are and yet there are those that say our pain is mere vanity and therefore we ought to stand and admire the moonlight, and when we show apprehension to the cold wind around us they reject us still. 
While there are exceptions, many of us must, against our will and soul, accept that loneliness is what we breathe and eat, and that this may never change.

I have Autism, Borderline Personality Disorder, persistent depression, and social anxiety.  So I have made a good amount of friends growing up but didn't realize who were actually friends or there to make a joke out of me. I have no friends from my childhood expect my girlfriend. I have friends who I can at best casually hang out with and talk about activities with. I have one total friend who I talk to about personal stuff with but she lives on the other side of the country and she's busy so I only get to talk to her once a week. I have tried to go to plenty of local meetups in the past and got no where but obviously can't now because of COVID.

Right now I am trying to find a two bedroom apartment for me, my GF, and her friend but we're going no where. I have tried to explain I have a co-signer in case we don't look good financially but they don't seem to give a shit. My GF has to move from her current place on Oct 1st and her friend came down from OR in mid August to move in with us and she will have to move back if we don't find anywhere by Nov 1st. We all have credit scores over 700, never been bankrupt, or have any criminal history. Me and my GF both currently work and everywhere we applied to we made 3x the rent before taxes. Our friend is looking for a job here currently. I have tried explaining we need somewhere ASAP, we have a co signer, and we ALL have even extra money saved up. Everywhere something went wrong.

My GF has always been the rock in the relationship because I'm mentally unwell but now she's going through a lot herself and she is breaking down everyday. I am trying to be the rock now and am failing. I keep trying to push through the renting search while she sees a future where we fail and her friend has to go home. I feel bad venting about this because she has been there for me for over 10 years and it's only right I am supposed to help her but I don't know how to help her when I cannot help myself.

If you browse the chat on there you will almost always see people talking about how alone and sad they are. Well since they are spending time in the chat, it makes me think that the stream must help with the loneliness at least a little bit..I know it does for me.

However, I find myself still yearning for a more personal human interaction.

Due to that, I created my own 24/7 lofi stream EXCEPT it has a real human in it (me) to make it more personal. The goal is to create a community of friends where you can chat, chill, and listen to music. Hopefully make the world a little less lonely

750,-Living-Dead-Girl-,1600712927,1,"ok so very quickly summed up back story: 
im very socially inept due to autism and anxiety. i spent about 5 years of my life where i was 'friends' with 2 people, who didnt seem to want me around and wouldnt let me be part of their social circle no matter how much i tried and how much i cried for their help. one of them was much worse than the other, she would only use me to lend her money and stuff and would only hang out with me when it was just us, even when i would make it clear how lonely and sad i was and literally begged her at some points to let me come to social events she had. her friends were actually really nice and once or twice even said to me about hanging out, but she would literally get mad and not allow that to happen. so anyway, at some point i got close with another girl (the only real friend ive ever had) this girl ended up having a HUGE drama with the horrible friend of mine over a guy, it got violent, i took my nice friends side, stopped being friends with horrible girl. never ended the friendship with the other less horrible girl, but she never wanted to hang out and just kind of let it die.

(ok maybe back story is kinda long even when its the super short version im really sorry. thanks brw to anyone who reads this.)

ok, so its been like 2 years maybe, and my best friend is still my only friend but its kind of great, its e first time ive had a friend who actually wanted me around, stuffs good. so, me and best friend had kind of a big falling out, which sucks. i run into the not as terrible girl at the park and we sit and talk for a while (shes nice when we're together but seems to have 0.00 interest in meeting up) whilst im with her in the park, a lot of people from that general social circle show up, including horrible friend and her bf. we ignore eachother, i strike out with my attempts to be social, and go home. soon after, best friend shows up at my door, she tells me she got into university a very long way away and is moving. i have a whole other post about this situation. so anyway, best friend is gone forever and i am left with no one. no prospects of ever having a friend again. im VERY messed up over the whole situation.  i sent a desperate text to not as horrible friend telling her about best friend being gone and asking to maybe hang out because im very upset, she basically says 'maybe' but then laundry lists excuses as to why she can never meet up.

BUT YEAH OK now to the actual thing im proud of. i just got a random message from not so horrible friend, asking me what im up to. i freak out, im like omg, she actually wants to hang out. but, that message is followed by her telling me horrible friend doesnt hate me and doesnt want to beet me up? i say im not scared of her wtf. i then call, ask what shes doing, she says shes at her house and will be going to horrible friends house soon and horrible friend is with her. i ask why she thinks im scared of horrible friend, and reiterate that i am not. (horrible friend likes to think shes 'psycho' and that people are scared of her) i then ask if she thought i wanted to hang out with horrible friend and said that i didnt. 

""i know *best friend* is gone, and that sucks, but that doesnt mean im going back to desperately trying to be friends with people like her. its hardly better than being alone, i did it for 5 years and im not going back to it. see ya""

SO YEAH IM JUST REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF FOR NOT FALLING BACK INTO THAT HORRIBLE SITUATION AND I KNOW IVE JUST THROWN AWAY MY ONLY SHOT AT FRIENDSHIP BUT I DID IT FOR MY SELF RESPECT AND I DIDNT KNOW WHERE ELSE TO SHARE THIT BUT I REALLY NEEDED TO SHARE.

753,autophobic_,1600711018,1,"I guess I should start from the beginning.. This post will be long but I can’t afford a therapist and I’ve kept this all bottled up for 21 years because I have no one to talk to &amp; don’t want to burden anyone. My mother suffers from severe manic bipolar and narcissism. She was very mentally &amp; emotionally abusive to me throughout my childhood. I am the second born of 4 children, I received the most neglect and abuse from her. My father is a great man. I truly think he has a great heart, but he was never emotionally available to me &amp; my siblings. He has endured my mother’s abuse for 25 years and has always put her needs before ours. I don’t really blame him for his part of the neglect, but sometimes I find myself wishing he had cared more about us kids.. Enough to divorce her and keep us safe. But he was trapped in her mental abuse and I feel incredibly bad for him. I was molested when I was 5-6 years old by someone at my church, &amp; I didn’t tell anyone for 11 years. When I finally told my mom 11 years later, she said she already knew. My first serious boyfriend had some family issues of his own, so he moved in with me when I was a freshman in HS. We dated for almost 2 years, cheated on me the whole entire relationship, with many girls, including with my mother. I had such abandonment &amp; self-worth issues from my childhood traumas, I didn’t even break up with him. He broke up with me. I begged him to stay. That’s the beginning of my pathetic relationship history. My senior year of HS, my mother texted me while I was at school, &amp; told me she was about to commit suicide &amp; that I needed to take care of my family. I spent the whole day speaking to counselors &amp; police officers &amp; my dad, trying to figure out where my mom was &amp; what to do. She ended up being fine, but she spent a month inpatient at a mental support hospital. Meanwhile, my dad had to juggle 3 jobs to make up for my mom’s missing income, &amp; I had to balance 2 jobs, high school, &amp; taking care of my two siblings in elementary school. I was in national honors society, graduated with a 4.0, &amp; none of my peers at school even knew what I went through at home. The school made me talk to my counselor once a week after what happened with my mom, but I never knew what to say. It’s as if I had gotten so used to my fucked up life that I was numb to it. I graduated in 2017, I’m now 21 years old &amp; never went to college because I had no time to prepare for my future while dealing with all of my mothers issues. I was always friendly with people in my high school, but I never formed any real close friendships. The only real close friend I ever had, her father passed away of cancer our sophomore year, &amp; our friendship became very strained and we faded away. I have been in a few romantic relationships, but none of them ever loved me. I have terrible taste in men, and most of the guys I’ve been with formed a strange obsession with me, but it was never love. Always just physical lust &amp; obsession. My grandpa got diagnosed with cancer when I had first graduated high school, &amp; I tried to break up with my boyfriend at the time to be able to take care of my dad in such a hard time for him.. When I told him we needed to break up, he lied to me &amp; said he had testicular cancer to get me to stay with him.. This is just one of the many strange &amp; scary things boys have said/done to me. I am now 21 and just feel so alone in every sense. I’ve been with my current boyfriend for 2 years this month. We have lived together for a year now. He claims to love me, says he cares about me, holds me while I cry about never having a mother or anyone to love &amp; nurture me, but he’s emotionally unavailable. He’s the only guy I have ever been with that hasn’t cheated on me, &amp; that’s the main thing I hold onto in our relationship. Besides him not cheating, he repeatedly hurts me over &amp; over again, neglecting my needs &amp; leaving me trapped in the same cycle I had with my mom. He is such a good person. He has a good heart. But he suffers from bipolar as well, &amp; severe depression. I’ve stayed by his side for 2 years, but he repeatedly goes days without hugging or kissing me, has never gone out of his way to do anything special for me, and just all over shows no interest in me. He apologizes, then continues neglecting me. I love him, &amp; I care about him, but at some point it feels abusive &amp; manipulative. I don’t think he’s purposely manipulating me, but it feels so similar to the relationship I had with my mom. Begging for them to love me, &amp; never receiving it. I think I might be cursed. To be unlovable forever. I naturally am a very nurturing and loving person, I want to save everyone &amp; make everyone happy. But I want someone to be that for me. I don’t want to be strong anymore, I want to be able to break &amp; have someone there to show me I am not unlovable. But I’m starting to lose out hope that I will ever get that feeling. The only reason I haven’t offed myself yet is my younger siblings. They give me purpose to live. Thankfully my mom has improved IMMENSELY since I was younger, &amp; she isn’t quite as abusive or neglectful to them anymore. But I created great bonds with them as I cared for them when they were little. I just crave the feeling of safety &amp; love &amp; support. I crave it so much. In a friend, or a boyfriend.. Anything. All of this trauma in my childhood has left me feeling lost &amp; empty. I’ve been taking care of everyone for so long.. I just want to be taken care of for once. I don’t even know the point of making this post. Maybe just to see if anyone understands or feels the same way? Sometimes it feels like I’m all alone in this world &amp; that no one on this earth could ever understand me or love me. Can anyone out there see me?

I’m not an attractive girl, and no I will not send anyone a photo of me so please don’t ask, nor am I interesting, funny, or smart. I genuinely don’t see a world where anyone would willingly want me in their life. I don’t see why anyone would ever care about me. 

I’ve went to prom or other formals because nobody ever asked me. I’ve never been catcalled or approached in public by men which shows just how undesirable I truly am. I’ve never been asked out before and always have been rejected because I’m just not *girlfriend material*.

764,DifferentFriendship8,1600696290,1,"The most spectacular case was a 10+ years ""friendship"" via chats, whatsapp, and very rare very short encounters with this friend... I tolerated rude replies, put-downs of my interests, attempts to make me do things their way, and the bare minimum amount of input from them: we would not have even met if it was not for me, I spent even money on gifts never reciprocated and trips, receiving crumbs now and then, and in the end when I said enough... well, just I stopped giving inputs and it has been three months of radio-silence on their part. Good riddance, but it was unhealthy on my part.

Another similar story for the same amount of years went on with a ""friend"" who never wanted to meet in person for mysterious reasons and that ghosted me two years ago, only to resurface as if nothing happened. I closed that door without them even apologising. Is the same story, me updating them about everything and spilling my beans like not even with a psychologists and them giving me next to nothing in return. I was not part of their group of inner friends but I called them my best friends.

A similar trend is going on with my sibling who at least loves me for real. But I am the one keeping things up and spilling my private beans while being in the dark about their live. It's painful and humiliating. Also I try to deny my interests, try to approve and nod at what they believe or like, and I'm generally a cheerleader even if it is emotionally exhausting and honestly insincere. I feel bad. Listen, nod, support, cheerlead, give. Friendship?

Strangely enough, me and those people have nothing in common but they are willing to put up with me. They are not the kind of people I would chose as similar-minded or similar-hearted or with similar passions, it's just that I tail-wag constantly and they let me be around them. Sort of. Now I am trying hard to do that with a new flatmate 12 years my junior who made me promise to watch football with him and then yesterday left me crushed by going to one of his friend's homes to watch the first football match. And I don't even like football that much at all, and also he doesn't know I dislike the team he roots for.

In short, I'm myself only within myself, I live in my inner world, my sanctuary, where I actually exist. No one outside me has ever really met me. And to put salt on the wound they claim to know me and give me advice and assessments, and then I feel pressured to conform to their idea of me and my values/personality/wishes.

I'm tired of having to expose myself by reporting on my inner emotions or my life events to people that I don't want to tell about things, and even more tired of bonsai-ing myself to fit their world view and be their mirror. And I am tired of all that anger and resentment when it turns out I'm not their best mate for life. So I'm both alone and questioning the worth of my true interests and passions and values, while being exhausted by this play pretend game that is leaving me dry.

766,HonorableTaco,1600694703,1,"Why do I feel like I always put the most in my connections and friends? I managed to cut off toxic people whom I believed weren’t good for me. Now that I have my group of friends, I feel like I’m always going the extra mile with them. Why is that. I don’t want to say “Am I not enough” because I know I’m not but I don’t know. They say put in what you want to see from others but I feel like I don’t receive the same energy back. They’re good people, I just feel like they do the bare minimum sometimes. Bringing it up to them would feel like I’m begging them to do so and it would become meaningless since it didn’t come from them. I also know sometimes people are oblivious and show their support in different ways but just gahh. Seriously? Not ONE person in my 22 years of living have done something to make me feel appreciated? 

For example, on birthday’s I buy cute little presents to show my appreciation to them. Something they’ll like. Or I just randomly send them gifts or text them like, “I was just thinking about you, I hope you’re doing okay” and “How’s everything going on? Good luck on your shift today!” 

I hangout with friends on the weekends and spend my weekdays on school, gym, work, my hobbies, etc. 

I’m honestly on the verge of figuring out a way to connect to more people. I’m always the one starting the friendships anyways so it’s not a problem to meet new people. It’s just how with the epidemic going on. I know there’s more out there .

768,DeadInnside,1600693234,1,"Yeah I kinda feel like I already lost this. I lost my time when I could have been with someone. I was one of those smart kids in school, who generally kept busy with studies and competitions. I was popular in my school, but since our school was separated into boys only and girls only sections, I never got to interact with girls of my age. That used to bother me, but I was advised and told by every adult around, that I should focus on studying and making a career and the right partner will come in due time. So I did the same. Followed what the ""elders"" told, did well in school, went to a pretty good college(Again, a college with 1: 40 girls to boys ratio) . I'm 21 now. About to leave college and land into a job.   


But What would I do of all this so called ""achievements"" when I have no one to share it with. I have never been able to experience any school or college love or romance, that is sooo normal and beautiful to experience. That innocent love that everyone dreams of. I missed that.   


Seems like I am destined to just lead a solitary life from now on. Don't think any girl would want to be with someone like me, who doesn't have any ""experience"". And I barely know how to, or what different things I have to do when interacting with girls. I just talk like I talk to normal people when I ever(rarely) do interact with some girl. And seems like even if I find some attention, that'd be solely due to my job and not because of love for me.   


I guess I lost my opportunity. If only I had understood that finding love was also necessary, I wouldn't be here. Now being 21, all girls have found love. I also fear that I would end up in a toxic relationship, given how needy I am. And how I don't have any idea what is normal and what is not normal when it comes to a relationship.   
All in all, I've just failed already. I have trouble focusing on my work too. Cuz I'm constantly being reminded by people around me, how I am a loser to be alone and how I've lost my time to find people.",lonely,I lost..,2020-09-21 23:00:34

772,Antique-College-478,1600685701,1,"21M here. Growing up, with the exception of high school, I always went to small schools. Like, I literally had nineteen other kids in my grade school class, and I usually had one or two best friends at the time, which I was content with.


However, even back then, it almost seemed like my ""best friends"" looked down on me because I never really hung out with anyone besides them. They had friends that went to the local public school that they had met through playing sports or whatever, meanwhile the only other people I hung out with, besides them, were my cousins. There was one friend in particular that I really considered my best friend, and I wanted him to be my best friend too, but he usually made a point of telling me that I wasn't really *his* best friend and he had plenty of other friends to fall back on. Generally, he'd be saying that in the context of an argument over who gets the shitty controller when we were playing Xbox 360 or something, with him seriously threatening to stop being my friend if I didn't give him the good controller, which he had to have every time we played a game. People threatening to stop being my friend has been a reoccurring theme throughout my life.


I guess I've always had a proclivity to fixate on one person who I like a lot, and that just doesn't work in today's social climate. Maybe it never has. I guess it's natural for most people to be repulsed at the idea of someone else liking them the most, not having a bunch of other people to fall back on, and thinking there's something unique/special about them. 


My social tendency of only liking a select few people definitely didn't serve me any favors in high school either. It didn't help that I'm shy/quiet, but I just don't like that many people. Self admittedly, I'm a very sensitive guy, and it's easy for me to feel hurt/resentful if someone makes one rude comment, and I usually write them off as someone that I don't really wanna deal with from that point forward. I didn't make any new friends in high school. The only person I actually had over to my house, aside from my ex girlfriend, was my friend from that I had met back in grade school (not the same on previously mentioned).


Then college came. My ex girlfriend had broken up with me toward the end of that summer (2017), I had a falling out with the friend I had from 7th grade until senior year, and I was dealing with a relatively serious case of depersonalization (still dealing with it) following a weed-induced panic attack. I could only take one class my first semester due to the dissociation, and I was commuting to school. Did I mention I'm extremely shy? Yeah, I talked to one person in that single class I took my first semester, and I talked to maybe four people in total throughout the two semesters I went to that university.


Well, then I dropped out of college, and I started working at a restaurant. Again, I felt like I didn't fit in with the other people whatsoever, almost like I wasn't even a person. However, I met a dude there, and he's my only current friend to this day, and we've been friends for about a year and a half now. Unfortunately, I got into a heated screaming match with a manager there who yelled at me for making a trivial mistake, but that's for another story, really.


I worked at another place up until about four months ago after I quit the restaurant job, and it was more of the same, except this time I had two old guys who, for whatever reason, thought it would be funny to try to pick on me (trying to say that I'm gay, which isn't true or even something to make fun of someone for) because they thought they could since they're ten to thirty years older than me, which resulted in more confrontations and a screaming match between me and them, and that's never a particularly good feeling. I didn't make any friends at that job, obviously. 


Then, in the midst of the quarantine a few months ago, I started talking to a lady in her early 30s that liked my thoughts in one of my posts. We clicked immediately, and it was weird because I never really understood the ""online romance"" thing, and I honestly thought it was odd. We didn't have an official relationship or anything, but we had very serious plans of her flying over here and us meeting once the virus situation chilled out. It was crazy, we talked 24/7 for a little over two months, video called every two or three days, and it actually seemed like she *liked* me, and I don't think anyone, with the exception of my immediate family, has ever genuinely liked or cared about me even a little bit. I  don't think I've ever talked to another human being that seemed to get me like that, and I'm not sure there's anyone else who even could if they tried.


Naturally, since she lived in the UK and I'm in the US, along with the age difference, and probably because of me as a person, she decided that it was best if we never met, and she deleted all of her social media to take a break from it, so we haven't talked in almost a month, and I don't think we're going to talk anymore. There's really no reason for us to talk at this point. I talked to another girl, just as texting buddies since I'm not about the online relationship thing, and we seemed to get along well and I enjoyed talking to her, but she ghosted me out of nowhere about a week ago, and I don't think we're going to be talking again. I guess she just didn't like my personality, which is okay since no one has. I think my parents do like me, but my dad has straight up said that my personality sucks, and my mom has implied it many times. 


That brings me to now. I have one friend who I haven't seen in person for almost nine months, I go to college online, I haven't spoken to anyone from grade school or high school in years, and I really don't talk to anyone in general. I don't know, I just think I've really dropped the ball socially. Sorry for the rant, just wanted to write this.",lonely,Has anyone else always been kinda socially isolated?,2020-09-21 20:55:01

I have this problem with everyone in my life. I can get along and be friends in person, but if i have to text and call and shit it just feels fake and worthless.

I have a girlfriend who lives hours away because of school and it feels like a chore to keep up the relationship because it feels like it has no impact on my life.

The problem is that relationships just feel utterly meaningless if i don't *actually* see the person regularly. What is the point? We are living completely seperate lives that do not intersect with each other in a meaningful way.

780,smelly_almonds,1600677421,1,"
So I’ve been depressed since mid 2014 because I suffer through similar symptoms of TMAU. It started to get stronger and stronger and eventually got bad that no one wanted to really be around me. 

 I was in my junior year of high school and the last month of my junior year my family moved and I ended up in a new school and since I didn’t know anyone, it was just hard to make any friends so I isolated myself from everyone. I had to drug myself every morning in my senior year with cough medicine to just get through the day. I’d use music to escape reality and ended up with MD (Maladaptive Daydreaming) and still do to this day. I suffered with anxiety ever since I was 4 but it was mostly about life but when this happened I got really bad social anxiety and still have this now but not as bad as 2015-2017. I acted so weird honestly. 

 Whenever someone was walking towards me or there were groups of people I’d basically get as far away as possible from them or walk very widely around them. I was basically doing social distancing before it was a thing. Well anyone who has this problem basically has. Also I suffered with uncontrollable twitching, stuttering and non-stop trembling. 2015-2016 were the absolute worst years of my entire life. I was so low and I thought about ending my life every single day. I felt like an embarrassment. I felt dirty because since I smelled everyone just assumed I didn’t shower or anything. I tried everything to stop this. Different types of laundry detergents, soaps, shampoos, conditioners, deodorants, body sprays, perfumes, lotions, pills, vitamins, detoxing drinks, etc. but I just ended up wasting so much of my parents money and non of it worked. I even went to a gynecologists and they said everything was normal and fine. 

 I don’t even know how but I eventually graduated in 2016 and finally felt free. My dad forced me to go to a community college online. I was relieved but for orientation I had to sit in a class for a whole day with others and it was absolute torture. I don’t even remember it honestly but I remember entering and having other chuckle or cover their noses. Anyways I was told that even though I could do classes online that I’d probably would have to come and take tests in a classroom and somehow everything that I had gone through in school came back to me and I couldn’t take that so a week after just doing online school I quit and luckily they gave my dad his money back. 

 Fast forward to 2018 and I get a job. A horrible job where I have to watch kids. They of course smell it and make fun of me and again all the memories come back but I can’t quit this time. I wait at least a year until I finally do since it was my first job. I again started to feel low and dirty but I tried to focus on other stuff like exercising, researching what exactly I have and learning new things. During 2018 to 2019 I go to a few doctors and they supposedly don’t smell anything. I finally find a doctor who even though doesn’t smell anything still decides to help me and we do a blood test to see if I have TMAU. I don’t and it kinda bummed me out because I was hopeful to at least know what I was suffering with. The doctor tells me it’s a good thing because TMAU is incurable so I still have a chance. 

 Let’s fast forward to now. This year has probably been my most productive year so far. Since everyone is in quarantine it feels like the world was finally forced understand what I had been going through. Keeping their distance, cleaning excessively, not touching each other, doing FaceTime calls instead of meeting in person and the masks are definitely a bonus for me. I’ve been able to do so much because of pandemic. I’ve drawn more, have actually for once been keeping up with my exercises, am eating way more healthier, have been writing in a journal everyday (something that’s on my bucket list is to complete a journal, sketchbook, etc. because I’ve never done that in all my 22 years), learned how to sell online, learned how to do business a little, learned about how money works, was able to read more, learned about minimalism, I’ve been forcing my family to donate stuff because we have way too much junk and I’d really would like to see this house in better shape for them, learned a lot about technology (fixing iPhones but not actually having attempted it yet, how to build a P.C., etc.), have been researching more about the possible condition I could have and am waiting to see when I’ll be able to do some test, a lot about mental illnesses, and I’m sure there’s more but I’ve never been able to do so much and I’m proud of myself.

 Recently I finally decided what type of career I’d like to pursue and that’s becoming a baker. I really loved learning how to cook for my family since no one really knows how to and I was thinking about becoming a chef but I’m picky when it comes to foods and smells (how ironic right) but I absolutely LOVE desserts and am now starting to practice a little bit at home. I don’t know if there’s be any online schools for that but I’m searching. I’m just glad I finally found a true passion. This year has honestly been such an eye opener for me. I finally feel like an adult. I don’t look like one though but at least I don’t feel like a some child who needs to hold her mom’s or dad’s hand all the time. I still struggle in going to places though because of course many people don’t respect social distancing rules but I’m able to remain calm most of the time and I don’t twitch, tremble or stutter unless I get extremely uncomfortable. Something else I struggle with is staying off my phone. I was kinda able to during the beginning of the year but during like July I got super addicted to it again. I now deleted almost all of them to not deal with that but I’m addicted to checking the selling sites all the time because I want to just sell as much as possible. I have this horrible habit of spending whenever I earn money. I’ve spent so much but now I’m not going to spend a cent and wait to see how much I’m able to sell by the end of this year. (By the way for anyone thinking about selling themselves I would recommend Mercari more to eBay. Selling smaller things on eBay that cost less cause it’s safer and selling more expensive stuff on Mercari. Depop is another good option. Just sell to anyone who has good ratings on any of these sites) Yeah I have a bit of money from my job which is why I’ve been able to spend this year but I’m going to stop. 

 Yeah that’s my story so far. I want to try and make friends but I’m still pretty depressed. I have no energy to actually communicate with anyone at all. I don’t really even feel like trying to communicate with anyone because of what I have so we wouldn’t ever really be able to meet up unless I ever find an answer and since I feel like I won’t ever find an answer I just have no energy to even try. But I want to try to push myself to try and make friends and to stop depending so much on my phone and just not feel bad. If anyone has advice for me on how to not feel so messed up or how to stop using my phone almost the whole day or how to make friends that’d be really cool.

789,King_Schultz23,1600672828,1,"Hi everyone,

I’m wrapping up my first quarter of dental school, and in spite of COVID-19, I’ve done my best to make friends both in lab when we get to go on campus and virtually. Since I have a strong natural science background from college, I willingly decided to hold review sessions for exams throughout the quarter, mainly with the goal of making friends and meeting more of my class since we had a disengaging, online orientation.

I am fortunate to have made a few friends, but I’ve found out through the grape vine that people think that though I am smart and kind to be so selfless with going out of my way to help my classmates in any way possible, I am also “socially inept,” “nerdy,” and I guess even one could say a loser. 

I guess it’s socially unacceptable to have intellectual hobbies like reading, Star Wars, and watching documentaries. I’m also really into 90s punk music and gangster rap — I play the guitar and do turntablism for fun. 

My classmates wouldn’t think twice of inviting me to any social functions outside of school, but I am the first person they turn to if they don’t understand something in lecture or would like a link to the quizlet I’ve made for an upcoming exam. 

The social structure I am in is really much like a stereotypical hierarchy high school system ripped straight out of a movie like “Can’t Buy Me Love” or “Lucas,” and I am the quiet nerdy kid that is nice and helpful but is still disrespected. People say mean things about me and won’t even acknowledge me in person, but always attend my review sessions and never contribute. They sit with their microphones muted and cameras off. I just wanted to make friends 😢. 

I have decided to no longer going to help my classmates, I’m only looking out for myself and the few friends I’ve made. 

I can’t help but feel horrible about myself for being “weird.” My classmates act like there is something wrong with me, as if maybe I don’t belong here. Perhaps I should move back home, which is on the other side of the country.

I’ve been thinking about leaving the program anyway because it’s uninteresting, but I am feeling even more compelled now that I am basically an outcast. Anyone have any advice? 

Thank you!",lonely,Being bullied in professional school,2020-09-21 17:20:28

I'm a male 22 years of age, I've been living on my own for over a year &amp; since then I feel like I've been somewhat depressed, like not wanting to kill myself or anything but just a general sadness/loneliness in life - it's this constant feeling that never goes away. I feel like I don't have much to live for anymore (I do have a good job &amp; I am not struggling financially).

I do have a few friends that I hang out with occasionally but other than that I don't really have anyone. I do have a family but we are anything but normal, I have a few brothers &amp; sisters that I haven't seen or heard from for years, the only ones I really keep in contact with is my mum &amp; dad.

I don't really have many hobbies either, I like to game (On PS4) &amp; work on my car when I can but that's about it. I also have this very bad obsession with social media, I tent to just mindlessly scroll through Facebook &amp; Reddit for hours just to cure some boredom (about 5hrs a day).

I feel like my life isn't really going anywhere, it's just repetition. I go to work then come home &amp; that's it, even on my weekends I usually just do nothing. I mostly just want to go to bed as soon as I get home to get away from my own thoughts.

Surely this isn't normal but I don't really know what is anymore, I think I just need to find some friends or even just people to talk to just to relieve this feeling. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",lonely,Depressed? Or just lonely?,2020-09-21 09:31:08

I have 2 very good friends, who live far away from me, so I see them once a year. A phone call or Whatsapp message doesn't take the place of human interaction.

Working from home means that the current pandemic (Covid-19 for anyone reading this after 2021) doesn't bother me much. I realized that I am alone, and that I always have been. At school, college, work situations. There isn't a box for me, there is nowhere that I fit in.

It used to bother me a lot, not fitting in. Going around from social circle to social circle or social situation, then realizing there is nothing for me there. I don't do the social circle hopping thing anymore.

I have been in crowds of people, sometimes with people who I thought were my friends, only to be lonely as hell. Feeling empty and dead inside. Putting on fake smiles, pretending that life is just great, when all I was is an empty shell, with a mask for a face.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not depressed. I used to be very depressed, strong meds, hospital stays, the whole 12 yards. I tried the suicide thing, and someone found me, and I survived. Then one day I told depression to fuck off and leave me alone. It took a few rounds, I got knocked down a few times, but I got up, and I won! That is a post for a different time and sub though. 

Sometimes, I wonder, if what I am feeling is what it would be like if I was immortal, and everyone I get close to and love eventually die, and I am left behind. Thinking about a situation like that makes the prospect of immortality less appealing, to be very honest. I also think about having that one special person, the one you fantasize about when you are little, the one you talk to when no one is around, the one person you can describe in the finest detail, but that you haven't met. You don't even know if that person exists in real life. But if that person can exist in your thoughts, and in your mind, then surely this dream person must exist in real life, right? Somewhere? Maybe living right around the corner, but you miss bumping into each other at the grocery store because of different schedules and very busy lives. 

What would be great is having someone to chat to, about everything. Someone who doesn't judge, who shares the same interests, and who can hold a conversation. That could be a start, right? The start of companionship. I think companionship is the most underrated aspect of the human needs system. It's not so much sex, or intimacy, but companionship that most people crave.

Then last year I had to move again to a completely new country for my education. I had to leave everything behind, my family, my friends, everyone... I moved with one of my best friends that I've known for about 6 years, I felt a little better knowing that there was someone with me on this journey.

I was adjusting to the new environment i was in, trying to socialize with new people in my highschool, build new connections. Then some shit happened between me and my best friend and we stopped talking with each other, and all the people I've been talking to trying to socialize with took his side, which ultimately left me alone.

This happened a couple weeks before quarantine, and things weren't getting any better at all. I stopped communicating with anyone, i was basically the quiet kid that you know nothing about in the classroom. Then came quarantine and from that time until now I have been sitting home all day, either playing call of duty or studying...

I moved again for my senior year to another area and school, i was both relived and stressed at the same time... I got to have a clean slate, again. But I don't know anyone and nobody knows me... Senior year has been online mostly and things haven't changed since junior year... I started getting social anxiety whenever i leave the house to buy groceries, limiting any kind of interaction with anybody.

Yesterday I told myself, enough... I have to try opening up and trying to talk to people. I heard about this app called Yubo that connects you to people around you in the area to chat with. So I went ahead download the app, setup an account, and there you have it... Dozens of people I can possibly talk to, dozens of possible friends you can make.

I clicked on a random stream with two girls and a guy, they were welcoming at first. The guy was flirting with the girls in a sexual way and wanted me to join in, I dodged his invitation in an attempt to have a normal conversation. He then went to my bio and started making fun of how I look, what I like, etc. I usually don't take criticism like this seriously, I laugh it off and move on. But this time the girls he was flirting with joined in to mock me. He then told me to leave the chat room and banned me from entering it.

After that moment I went ahead and deleted both the account and the app, then told myself ""never again""... Lately I feel rejected by society, by my family, all the people I've known throughout my life.

839,caustic255,1600631562,1,"THIS IS LONG! THIS IS YEARS OF HOLDING ONE SERIOUS PROBLEM IN BEING LET OUT AT ONCE.

So ill try not to bore you with too much boring crap, but want a really good understanding of where im at with this, so YES ITS LONG, but i also used this time to get alot of shit off my chest. None of u know me, and my story is fkd, and this isnt even covering a whole nother section of misery i went through after losing it all. But because im so tired of dealing with this after so long its affecting me on a subconscious level now and its starting to actually hurt, physically, mentally. Seriously. Any1 who reads this and responds please dont judge certain aspects as i assure i failed to mention something, i tried to just explain over a decade of problems, that ive held in for 17/18 years. Also, i am currently 33 yrs old.

HERE IT GOES!

I was with my ex/ sons mother for 13 years, besides a 6 month breakup halfway in, we got together when i was 19, she was 18. We were in absolute LOVE back then, or atleast the first 5 years. She was a virgin when we got together, doesnt matter at first sight but she didnt wait that long for religion, but more of a ""aint not mf getting the luxury"" attitude until we met and she trusted i deserved it (her words not mine) and she was ready to finally ""get'r'done"".

Of course she fell more in love with me then, but it was fine, she was the ""good girl"" my ""bad boy"" needed and wanted so ide grow up a little and recently being placed on my own (father took job abroad, left within 5 days of finding out, left me with 120$, a vehicle, 2lbs of weed he had left me to sell (had bills to pay, so yes he sold a lil herb on the side) and when she gave me a chance, i dedicated. Forgot to mention, she was VERY hard to get, alot of guys chased her, she was hot, hard to get, sassy, and parents were loaded. I love a challenge, never liked the easy ones, and frankly, before her i was smashing whatever i wanted and was bored honestly. I wanted something REAL. Boy did i get that...

Jump to about 6 years later, son is born, quit my career for a while due to being accused of cheating because i was promoted to a higher position that was much more serious and had to prove i could handle it. Her never having real career goals or ever really working, failed to understand this, i quit out of anger and went back to selling cars to earn quick (easy) nice size checks. Then after still being accused, simply by going close a car deal on my off day (not unusual) she yet again assuming shit, called the dealership, asked the receptionist if i was there, and her never seeing me, only knew i was scheduled off, and relayed i was not there. 54 missed calls, 72 VERY vulgar texts later (not exaggerating) i threw in the towel after my deal was done. Went home, packed my shit and left. Breaking my cellphone and all, cause fuck that thing. I was ALWAYS faithful, and loved my family. Figured leaving for real would provide a reality check. That took 6 months, and me starting a temporary fling with an in-process of divorce chick, who was everything my ex was not. Confident, had a good job, beautiful, tons of sex appeal and both knew we couldn't be together but got damnit i swear to this day me n that girl had moments that i never have and never will ever feel those feelings again. The type where your looking into each other's eyes not saying a single word but both feel the same shit, and its INTENSE. Even moreso because we couldn't be together seriously, 2 people, finally free and in similar situations feeding off eachothers emotions, desires and needs. To this day i would do anything to feel that one more time. Partly why im here so take note of that. 

( That particular night was the only time besides my son being born ive ever felt that feeling. It was like NOTHING ive ever felt. Chest warm, butterflies, Sure love was there, but amplified by knowing u both cant have it, but want it bad, even more amped by knowing the other is feeling everything you are, and havent uttered a word, just fire in eachothers eyes i guess...got damn that moment..)

So after that got ruined (by guess who!) After 6 months by her constantly contacting her with lies and such trying to ruin us, which really didnt because the girl knew how she was. She go as far as saying ""B was here last night fkn me and said he never liked you"" while me and Fling were 2 states away having a weekend runaway, phones off and all, all weekend.

But shortly after me and Fling agreed too much shit was going on both of our ends, we agreed to one day, ""even if it takes til we r 80"" will wait for a better time. Then soon after, silly me, but severely missing my consistent time with my fairly young son, gave my ex another shot. Git my original career back before the dealership and Hoping shed learn a lesson, and knowing what i also needed to do, to make her happy. Including but not limited to, ZERO privacy, basically never having a life other than work, commute, home, couch, bed, commute, rinse repeat. 6 more years go by same shit going on, im tired of it.

This is where it starts getting juicy.

I get tired of her phone/social media addiction, boring sex, mundane dull, always feeling awkward ass relationship, after my previous hell i had when I Left HER, came up with the idea, of if i could just get her to put her ego and morals down enough to cheat on ME, i could get out without her making it her primary job to ruin my life and anything i started after. 3 months go by, nothing yet. At this point I've completely cut her off no attention no sex just being the perfect guy you would cheat on and January comes 2016 and right after I get my tax return of around $4,500 and I pay all the bills for about two or three months I noticed she would go to the store up the road for a very long period of time which was very unusual for her and I kept making jokes when she'd come back "" what were you doing talking to your boyfriend"" till the day came she got the balls to admit that she was talking to someone else right after I paid all these bills perfect timing right boy did that backfire financially so after some issy fitting and packing most of my belongings into my work vehicle I left never to return four reasons other than my son. This guy ended up being and on the road trucker of all things nothing against those guys but not the type I thought she would go for but made sense since he was always gone

But now here I sit in 2020 the last few years I have gained and lost a bad drug habit four times been made homeless four separate times after getting on my feet for separate times to lose everything over and over again to now I finally have my shit mostly straight and I'm having a mostly normal life and since over the years all I cared about was either getting high or the fact that I offered nothing to somebody else to bring to the table nor did I want a drug addict girlfriend also was afraid of finding the right one only to fuck it up with my problems I always pushed a relationship off

Now here is where my original problem lies starting this post.

I'm to the point now where I absolutely Miss so many things and it's been so long since I've even had a comforting hug from somebody that I start having these dreams every night,  Dreams that i *Feel* physically. It also doesn't help that for a long time I've always been fascinated by having the ability to control my dreams when I subconsciously do it which causes me to explore it even further making these dreams essentially turn into nightmares once I wake up. 

Which causes me to wake up and start replaying shit in my head and have this very strong desire to have this again now that I feel I am ready but the problem is...

After dealing with all her narcissistic shit for so long her constantly always trying to bash me and stripping my confidence every possible opportunity she had I've always thought it never would affect me being a strong minded as I was but now that I'm faced with reality I see that she has won because I do not have that confidence anymore as I fear rejection like I never used to. In ways that i feel just one rejection will solidify when she used to beat into my head that ""ide never make anyone happy/ youll never have anyone that will be there for you/ noone will want your ass, im suprised you got me"" 

I know it's all bullshit and were just words to break me down but now I actually feel these things mainly because I am almost terrified to let somebody down or find somebody that would be perfect and just to ruin it because of my need to over explain everything ( if you havent noticed yet )
Even the most unnecessary of things to over explain I can't help but do it and it drives me insane to give an example, A simple ""what do you want for dinner"" she would turn into ""  what the fuck do you want"" or if I simply told her something about work or why I would have to work an hour late or why they had a pile up in traffic that made me late to be home I'd have to explain that every which way possible to avoid a confrontation in this problem still lingers to this day and I don't know how to stop it.

I know that if I get into a relationship with the right person after going through the hell I went through she would be treated asnothing less than a queen but I can't even get the courage to go to step one or where to even start I was never like this before.

I know it is alot to read and take in. But please understand that this is not a recent issue that I'm curious about this is years and years of a few serious issues that I've never opened up about to anybody and it seriously affecting me emotionally, even ruining entire days say if I have a dream that lasted a particularly long time that I had a lot of control in or not a lot and it involved a lot of feelings involved (even just simply having a dream im cuddling the whole time, just reminds me of how good that felt, and how bad i want to feel that connection again, to only wake up and have that on my mind. It actually fkn hurts... And im having these NIGHTLY now. I just dont know. 

Seems like so much has changed in the years ive been out of the dating scene, coupled with my feara, and others lack of understanding of what ive been through. I almost wish some angel fell out the sky and found this post, fully understood and appreciated everything ive just wrote, which was HARD.

I am not a bad looking dude, I am very educated,  im just someone whos been through hell and back and needs someone to see my worth and accept my blunt forwardness and wants to be respected and happy just like i do.

I may have made a few stupid decisions after losing my career and family mostly due to like being a dog off the chain for so long I am currently at a loss on what you do I could never go out to a bar and find somebody that's not me the online thing everybody seems to assume every guy is the same and i honestly would prefer face-to-face conversations than the texting bullshit has the texting shit is the worst for me when going back to my over-explaining issue and how that pretty much ruins everything from the jump.",lonely,"6 years after breakup, her mental abuse, highly narcissistic acts still have me chained.

847,thegoodplace9,1600627974,1,"For the longest time, I've had issues with my body. I've been a chubby kid since childhood and over the years (I'm 23 now) I've learnt to appreciate myself for who I am. I don't want to change myself or my body for anyone else unless and until I really want to do it. 

This very fact has been the reason why I've been single all my life. I usually put up a strong front of being hard to approach socially. It's like a defense mechanism wherein no one would think I (an overweight person) is interested in them romantically. I have always considered my weight to be something that made me less as a person. I would always try to make up for my excess weight by working harder and harder academically. The academic and not so approachable front helped me remain aloof without ever giving others the idea that I was interested in dating. I feel like if I ever did that and the person didn't reciprocate, I'd be embarassed. I'm introverted. I'm reserved. I'm shy. Neither did a guy ever dare to approach me if he liked me (idk if any guy ever did) nor did I ever make the effort to ask out a guy I like. To avoid hurting myself of being embarassed, I prefer the life of being single. As bad as it may sound, I tried to make myself sociable in the past two years. However, my academic domain is dominated by females and I rarely get to interact with a male. 

When I was in my teens, I used to think that as years go by, I will somehow find someone who will love me for who I am. However, that never happened. I've become so comfortable in my own bubble of being single that inspite of trying my hand at online dating, I've failed to translate it into something real because of my inability to trust a guy completely for loving all of me. 

By now, you must have guessed that since I've never been in a relationship before, the intimacy that I have ever experienced is close to zero. Never been touched, never been kissed, never been loved. I've never been on a date before. Sometimes, talking to my peers, I feel like I've missed an essential part of growing up. Most of the people of my age have experienced teenage love- the feeling of being loved by someone for the first time, the feeling of going on a date for the first time, the feeling of holding someone's hands. I wonder if I ever happen to enter a relationship, will I be immature and teenage-like in my relationships? Will I ever be able to retrieve the part of adulting that I've lost? I'm a demisexual straight Indian female who doesn't want to opt for an arranged marriage so the chances of me ever experiencing intimacy are scarce.

Sometimes, I think about all of this and feel like I'll always be a failure in terms of romance.

P.s- This is not a post to seek suggestions to reduce weight. I'm using this medium to channel out my insecurities and concerns. I'm not desperate for love and I love myself for the way I am. If you've read this till here, thank you!

I know more or less how it ended up like that (emotionally unavailable parents etc.), but I don't know what to do about it. I don't necessarily seek advice, I just want to talk about it.

I've been in a relationship for the last 3~ years. We're very good at solving disagreements with conversation and talking about things that bother us. But if I'm going through a rough time for personal reasons, unrelated to him, I can't bring myself to share it. I always end up closing up and dealing with it by myself. And he'd notice something's not right but if he asks I'd always tell him I'm fine.

I have an older brother and a younger sister which I love very much. We share many interests and sometimes we even talk a little about our problems (especially about our parents) but I never fully open up about how I feel.

I barely have any friends. I like the people I work with and sometimes we go out, and there was a time one co-worker used to talk to me a lot about his life but it only went one way, I couldn't share with him my stuff the way he did. 

I talked about it a bit in therapy and the more I think about it the more I understand why I've always felt completely alone. First, I can't bring myself to believe people actually care enough to want to deal with my shit, and to stick around even if I'm unpleasant and still be emotionaly supportive. Second, I can't avoid the feeling that accepting help would leave me, how to say, in debt? Like there's gonna be a price to it? Or it's gonna come back to me in a bad way?

868,questionquestions99,1600614371,1,"For the past few months I have been making searches on YouTube and Google. On an average of three times a week, I get a feeling of loneliness and derealization. I’ve looked up “I’m lonely” or “I’m depressed” on YouTube tens of times. I’ve also looked up “derealization” on YouTube many times, but was disappointed to see that they were all more more informative than what I was hoping for. I caught myself for the first time a few minutes ago looking up “I’m lonely” and decided to write about my hypothesis about what I think why I may do this. 

What’s interesting is: 

the previous times I’ve looked up “I’m lonely” and “derealization”, I watched some informative videos that popped up as the search results. Upon watching these, I found myself being relatively satisfied. Some other times, there were confessional videos — confessing loneliness, that is. My loneliness, which was begging to feel empathy, was satiated upon watching these. 

The point ~~&gt;

Today, I looked up “I’m lonely”, firstly, on YouTube. I scrolled through the most recently uploaded videos and didn’t feel like watching any of them. Then, I looked up “I’m lonely reddit”, happened upon this subreddit, and didn’t feel like reading any of the posts. What I find odd is that I normally read or watch posts that cause me to feel like I’m not alone. Today was not that case. 

Conclusion ~~&gt;

My abstract observation is that I’m quite literally telling the search bar my state of emotion, as if it’s my friend.
My theory is that each time I search “I’m lonely” or “I’m depressed” on YouTube or Google, I’m actually wanting to talk to someone. The evidence is in the language (using “I’m” — i.e. first-person — instead of searching “loneliness” or something more general) and the fact that I don’t feel like using Google or YouTube or Reddit after the search has been done. The one friend I have is currently asleep right now and didn’t talk to me yesterday, so unfortunately I am here, talking to reddit and satiating my need to talk to someone by attempting to explain what I tend to do in this state (of loneliness). I don’t know what to do, and am currently debating whether to continue to post my obnoxious observations on the internet or to potentially bother the only friend I have with emotions that I’m ashamed of having when she’s too busy to talk to me. I don’t think it’s fair for me to put the burden of being a fueling factor of my loneliness on her; she’s too empathic to not feel bad about being busy. I’m unsure what to do. However, I feel like posting this anonymously is healthy for me. What I think is not healthy in most circumstances is to depend on the internet as an outlet for my negative emotions. Whether or not I am subconsciously depending on it is another question. I’m confused and sad, and so stumped and lost as a result.",lonely,Searching “I’m lonely” on the search bar,2020-09-21 01:06:11

Very very difficult to get out and do anything since covid has shut down all the places in my town and anywhere nearby. 

I have no pets either so I basically spend all my time playing video games or watching Netflix shows.

I do things with my family like go for walks and watch films together but it isn't quite as fun or fulfilling as doing something with a friend or partner.

I moved to a small private school last year and I was too worried about myself and was very awkward.

I barely talk to anyone even though I try. I may have had depression before last year but it has gotten worse recently. 

I see in movies and people around me are hanging out with friends having a great time, having girlfriends and just being happy. I constantly beat myself up for this because it’s hopeless. It’s 3:30 and I’m just done with so much. I don’t understand why I’m like this or why God if there even is one, made me like this. I like how I’m smart and tall but at what cost.

899,Scintillatingsoftly,1600585526,1,"It would seem paradoxical as women, especially attractive women, are considered to have it ""easy"" -- and yet, I'm still lonely. Ain't that funny. To some extent, there's truth to all that. I get plenty of attention no matter what I do, I'm always getting propositions for friendships and relationships, and I can essentially choose from a pool of people wanting to know me in some capacity. However, very little of that is genuine interest; it's sexual desire under the guise of any meaningful, personal connection. In certain regards, it's more isolating to be surrounded by attention -- unfulfilling, frivolous attention -- than to be completely alone. I have something, which is more than some, and thus I shouldn't be whining -- or so, I'm told. Nevertheless, it's draining. Draining to only have faked interest because you're not disgusting to look at. Draining to always be a sexual interest, never a friendly or platonic one. Draining to know that your worth is solely your body. 

Of course, I'm intimidating to other women. Seen as uppity. Or someone constantly seeking male validation because I dress a certain way and have a certain body. Or, seen as annoying when I do my best to endear myself to other women. 

I'm not a bimbo and feel that, if anything, my personality is on par with my looks if not better. That's of no importance though. Tiddies, amirite?

I'm always solely sexual. Never friendly. Or even romantic. I'm not quite sure what happened, really, but it's quite disheartening to never have someone interested in me. Just me. My brain floating around in my little head. 

I'm not really one to vent, but I thought why not? Maybe I'll make a new friend. Maybe someone will understand some bit of this. Who knows. If you did read all that, thanks. You're pretty cool:)",lonely,"I'm a young, conventionally attractive woman but I'm lonely.",2020-09-20 17:05:26

Luckily, I have a very nice job that I am very grateful for, and people do seem to respect me for my IT skills, but I still feel like a loser.  

I just feel so helpless.  Every time I try to escape loneliness, it ends in complete, total, and utter failure.   I got a tinder account recently.  The matches have been either scammers or completely uninterested in meeting up with me.  Pre-covid, I would go to bars and clubs, and I would approach women, but I would always get rejected, and I would become humiliated.

I moved for school recently, and every time I go to my apartment without them I get this crushing loneliness. 

I know they feel similar loneliness, neither of us are employed, we both don’t really have routines or hobbies or people to talk to. Being away from them hurts, I just want to be around them again. It’s almost making me associate the sadness with my home itself. 

I have struggled with social anxiety my whole life, I want to have a friend so bad but I’m just so terrified of being known, being talked about, being seen. Sometimes when I think about bad choices I’ve made that have hurt people I really feel like I don’t deserve to have friends, I’m only bound to ruin things again.

Lonely doesn’t even begin to describe it. If there’s a word that takes that 1000000000x deeper then that’s me. I’ve even developed really bad social anxiety &amp; awkwardness because I have no human interaction other than the 4 people I’m comfortable with. On birthdays I only get texts from my bf. Every year I wait up until 12 to read his message and then an extra 20 minutes if someone else will message and it never ever happens. 
I deleted Instagram because I was embarrassed about the amount of followers and likes I got on my pics. Some perspective, I had about 40 followers compared to the minimum 300 everyone else has. The last couple pics I deleted had 6-10 likes. I know that sounds crazy to care about but realistically this kind of stuff is the new norm. Caring about likes and followers. It’s so toxic but then again I’m not sure I’d think that if I was getting the numbers everyone else is getting. Anyway, I got tired of seeing everyone with all their friends, hanging out, going out, etc. My bf actually wanted me to get it back again so we could send some memes back and forth but I didn’t have the courage to tell him the real reason I deleted it. I went with “it’s too distracting”. 
Hell, I’m using a throwaway so he’ll never know I wrote in here. I don’t want him to know that I’m a loser with no friends because he’s an absolute social butterfly. Everyone loves him and he always has plans to hang out with all types of groups of people. Sometimes I think about how much of a surprise it’ll be for him when we live together and I’ll always be home. Hes tried to get me to come out with him and his friends but they’re years older than me and I get really anxious &amp; awkward. 
I don’t think he really knows I have no one because I’ve never actually really talked about it with him. I’ve complained about it but I don’t think he understands the severity lol. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even want a wedding because I have no one to invite other than my parents and my brother.

For the last 5 years, I’ve worked two jobs with 50+ hours a week. A lot of days were double shifts. I’d start at 3am and get off at 4pm. I only had one day off a week.I didn’t have a lot of time to hangout with friends. My boyfriend (now fiancé) and I barely had time for our relationship. I was exhausted and felt lonely.

I wanted to hangout with friends. I wanted to go on date nights with my boyfriend. I wanted to play my favorite video game all day or get lost in my favorite book. I had dreamed of having enough time to dedicate to following my dream of becoming a photographer. But, my life revolves around work and I literally did not have enough time in the day.

Since COVID hit, a lot of things have changed. I lost my full time job (the money maker) and my hours were reduced at my second job. I have never had this much free time in my 31 years of life. I did get to play my favorite video games all day. I did get to pick up a book and get lost in the story. I even picked up my camera, started a website and began my photography journey - which has been doing well. But, I feel more lonely than I did when I didn’t have enough time in the day. And I don’t know why. 

Maybe it’s the break in my daily routine that’s taking a toll on me. Maybe it’s the fact that even though I have a lot of extra time, there’s nothing to really do social wise since Covid has everything on lockdown. I’m the sort of person that needs consistency in their life and I don’t have it at this point in time.

I thought I would be happy to have free time. But it has made even the simplest of tasks hard to overcome. It’s hard to get out of bed in the morning. My favorite games and reading do not spark joy. It is hard to exist right now. When my fiancé and I go to bed I have never felt more lonely. I feel as if there’s a weight on my shoulders and it’s holding me down every day.

I try to acknowledge it, I try to talk to it like a crazy man but it doesn't says anything.

Where did we go wrong? Not so much as individuals, but as a GD species, as a generation of lost hope, as groups of lonely redditors. Basically, many of us are living parallel lives, scarily similar but hardly ever crossing. What happens when our lives do cross with those in the same situation? We dismiss it as meaningless; as not exactly, uniquely the same as ours. Or as lesser. Less valuable, less interesting, less redeemable. 

Because we might be lonely and sad, but not THAT sad and certainly not that specific brand of sad. We’re all very special and precious in our socially awkward state of loneliness. There’s just no one who ‘gets’ us.

I can’t be the only one who would never join a club that would take me as a member, right? (Half metaphorical example, half... not)

And if the club does turn out to be sufficiently acceptable, there must be something behind the invitation. It’s all just a big ploy to lift you up and then knock you down. There are so many people out there who have no sincere interest in you as a person, but reach out to you just to let you down or leave you. On purpose, obviously, not because you were the one hiding behind a wall, without reciprocating anything. They just should’ve ignored the rejection and continued trying, damnit!

921,MajorPain88,1600574777,1,"PLEASE READ THISNIF YOU HAVE THE TIME. I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE THAT RELATES TO THIS OR EVERYONE TO TELL ME THIS IS T NORMAL. 

To preface this entry in order to articulate the gravity of my situation today vs 16 months ago would require me to go back to far and get into way to many other topics. So the short version.... my life was never at any point on track to be where I am today. I’m a recovering drug addict and I was homeless and broke 16-20 months ago. If you had told me then that this would be my life today, I would laugh at you. 

For the first time in 13 years I’ve finally lived at one address for over a year. 20 months ago I was strung out and doing a lot of meth. I kicked the trash, got clean, and picked up a job washing dishes. I rode the bus when i needed to, I showed up everyday for work, I stayed clean and I started to serve tables. By my birthday I had saved up enough money to get an apartment and have my Fiancé and daughter move in. For 3 months the job was going great and than business plummeted with the end of summer. So I hit the pavement and looked for a more secure income. 

After 200 or more resumes being sent out, I got a reply by my now employer. I was hired as a Service Advisor, worked from November until COVID. COVID brought my family together in ways I would never have dreamed of. My daughter and I have a relationship that would never have become what it is because even though she lives with me now, I left at 530am and wouldn’t get home until 6pm. Covid gave us the time needed to heal. So if you could imagine, coming from being homeless to having a two bedroom two bath, with memories being made within the walls of this home, by all accounts I’m fucking winning. I have seen the good things happen and I have counted my blessings daily. So why did I start to feel incomplete?  

Covid had got me laid off as a Service Advisor for almost 4 months. Financially we were ok, and the the phone call came for me to go back to work. But it wasn’t as a writer, it was another location for the same company as their Service Manager. So I was called back with a promotion and that’s fucking awesome. Again I’m winning. 

Now remember I said I was riding the bus? I left this job interview in November with $330 in my pocket, and bought a very modest POS that I had to rely on to drive 100 miles a day. From bus to junkyard glamor. It did what I needed it to do until I could get something a little better. So now at almost a year later, from junkyard glamour I got through two more vehicles, each one a step up from the one before. Not by much but enough and one month ago I signed papers for my very own, first ever NEW car!  Like NEW! Not new to me but NEW!  Again, IM FUCKING WINNING! I’ve got a great career now, my family is together, I worked hard and was able to buy a new vehicle that’s safe and reliable. I’m clean and healthy and we are expecting an addition to the family in March. 
I AM WINNING AND I CAN SEE ALL OF THESE BLESSINGS THAT IM GRATEFUL FOR! SO WHY THE FUCK DO I FEEL SO ALONE AND EMPTY ALL THE TIME?  

When I get home I walk in and get that hug from my daughter and it’s the best part of every day. But that’s when I get home before she’s sleeping. Most times I get home and my fiancé is sitting on the sofa, barely cares to ask about my day. Most times she’ll ask me to do something that is for her. But the point is, when I don’t t get that hug, I get really upset because that’s the only part of coming home that makes me feel wanted.  

I’m surrounded by people and I feel so alone. I put on this facade like I’m ok and there is not a single person in my life that can just see me and know I’m not ok. Since we’ve known about our next baby, a boy, I’ve not told anyone more significant than my boss. My fiancé had already told my mother and sister. I lost that opportunity and I don’t have anyone else to share this special news with. I work everyday and come home to a house that I feel alone in, I dont have anyone to call to share this special life moment with, not a single person that’s in my daily life can look at me and know that I’m not ok. I’m imploding on the inside and crying almost every day, and everyone thinks I’m ok. 

Ya know, it makes me feel so guilty and shameful that when I come home and feel this way, I would rather be not coming hone at all and just be the homeless person I was 20 months ago. I would rather get off of work and just be alone for 8-10 hours every night. I would rather sit with myself alone, than go home to a family that I feel lonely with. When the sun came up, I could just put the smile back on and go to work. no one would know I was living as the homeless man from 20 months ago. No one would know because it’s not like anyone notices me now. 

I came from the depths of what others would see as Hell. I turned my life around and I feel so much guilt for feeling like that life is better than this one. WTF IS WRONG WITH ME? I’m ok with being alone , I’m ok with my time but why is it that in my own hone that we’ve worked so hard for, I walk in and feel so lonely and I’m surrounded by my girls? Son on the way and I feel like living the homeless life is better than coming hone. Tell me how fucking insane that sounds. 

i mean I can’t be insane if I’m self aware enough to realize how insane these feelings are  right? Can someone please tell me that this is something they’ve gone through? Can someone tel me that this isn’t a unique moment for me and that you’ve felt the same way with everything going right?  Can someone just message me and chat?  I really just need some companionship and someone that’s gets me. I hope my ramblings were articulated well enough to understand where I’m at. If you made it to this point, thank you so much. Thank you.",lonely,"32M, all things considering, I am grateful but so lonely and isolated.",2020-09-20 14:06:17

Tbh idek why i'm posting this. But ""pretend"" is the word i'm gonna use a lot. Tell me if i'm just being insecure and selfish but I feel like everyone is just pretending to live life and enjoying it. Everyone is just pretending to like me and be my friend. My friends don't actually like me right? They just feel sorry for me because i don't have anyone else and because they can't seem to get rid of me. I always reach out to them and tbh it feels like i annoy them whenever i talk/message them and asking them to hangout. My family is just pretending to care about me because we're related and there's nothing else they can do about it and they just have to tolerate me and pretend that they have interest in my life.  The guy i'm dating doesn't really like me. He's just tired of chasing girls that won't entertain him so he's just settling for me. 
The ""perfect"" couple you see on social media is also just pretending to be happy just for the likes. The rich and happy friend you got seems so contented with their life but in reality they also feel like an outsider in their own life. I feel doubtful of everything. I'm emotionally numb but idek why i grew up this way, I had a great childhood and a picture perfect family. I just think that emotions are temporary that's why i'm kinda wary of anyone who feels them so much. I feel lile i've gotten so good at pretending that whatever i'm really feeling i start doubting it too.

930,mohitk7,1600568301,1,"23M. I posted here a short while ago, but feeling rather shitty again.

It sort of feels like not having friends is in a way a death sentence on this planet earth. In university I've often been told to keep ""networking"". But it comes easier to some than it does to others. Loads of people get jobs and/or career opportunities simply based on their networks and connectivity. But seeing that no one exactly is friends with me, it seems like an impossible thing to accomplish. At one point I was even warned that progress in my career may not come if I kept being by myself.

Even school/university has the same pitfalls. In school we're often told to get involved, be leaders, live to the best of our potentials. University likes leaders. Hard to do any of that without a social aspect and being friends right?

During COVID lockdowns and restrictions, it sort of felt that every single person I talked too was whining about how they were sad they couldn't see their friends. Boy did that hit me hard. Crying about how they couldn't go hug them. I guess I'm the one that's full of shit.

At my age, it sort of seems that everyone is or has been in a relationship. I never have. They have purpose on this planet. They have connection to their communities. They have people they have intimate relationships with to the point that they're willing to travel all around the world to meet/be with them. On the flipside, I can't even get a text back.

I additionally have no hobbies. There's not too much I enjoy these days. Even things I used to enjoy I just don't anymore. The thought of pursuing hobbies just doesn't come. In fact it hurts a lot. Because I remind myself that there's loads of people out there who live fulfilling lives, post about it all over social media, and have hobbies that they're proud of.

Every time I try talking to someone, I remain at the bottom of their list. They will always have people they're more closer to. They will always have people that come before me. I know I'm a destined and unlikeable failure. Any frankly, these experiences have proved to me that I do not belong on this planet earth and shouldn't even try reaching out.

I have no purpose on this world. Nothing. I don't even know if having friends would help at this point. Because I'm so broken.

My life isn’t as bad as what other people go through, because I’m sure people go through worse. Even people that are in a similar situation to mine probably have it worse than I do, so I don’t want to pity myself for too long.

Long story short, my parents fight all the time. It didn’t just start randomly or anything, it’s always happened. It may have gotten worse, I don’t know. 

Anyway, I don’t really have any friends and it’s my own fault. I have a hard time *wanting* to deal with people because it’s easier to be alone. I don’t trust anybody, anyone could leave or stab you in the back at any minute. I rarely talk to anyone first because I don’t want to bother anybody. I probably bother a lot of people just by existing.

I probably sound really dramatic, but I wouldn’t even want to be friends with myself. I probably hate myself more than I hate everyone else. I try my best to be nice, but it’s hard because I just keep everyone at a distance and I don’t want anybody entering my life. It’s hard to put on an act all the time. 

Like when “trash” became my nickname last year, and my “group of friends” constantly called me that. Was that even normal?? I mean, someone pointed out that it was only being directed at me. It got to the point where I sometimes only reacted to the name “trash”. They’re nice people, but I don’t think they realized that they were getting carried away. I’m only human, y’know? 

And the year before, I was called “fake depressed” by this one girl all the time, and I wasn’t trying to act like that. She’s an okay person, too, but sometimes when she would make fun of me and call me fake depressed, it really put me down. And then halfway through the year, I had the whole lunch table to myself because she left to go hangout with her new friend.(I didn’t really mind, but I was super self conscious and I skipped lunch some days because I was afraid that people would think that I was eating weird, or that I looked weird or something.).

And it’s weird because I find that when I’m alone, while reading a book or watching T.V, I want somebody. Somebody to just care. But why would I deserve that when I am unable to care about a lot of things? In the words of my mother, I’m just miserable.

I don’t even know why I’m ranting. It’s pointless. Everything is pointless. 

And with the situation with my parents, I don’t even know what’s considered normal. I just assume that it’s normal. What if there’s something wrong and I just don’t know it because how could I know? And with the old friends that I mentioned, was that normal in a friendship? To be honest, I don’t even know anymore. I probably wasn’t innocent either. I joked around a lot. I didn’t try to make them feel bad or anything and I don’t think I ever offended them. Not sure.

Here I am, still alone and lonely, just like elementary school, middle school, high school, and college, only now in the working world.

It's probably never going to end. Just an endless loop of working and hobbies until I die and nobody I know will attend the funeral. It will be posted about online as connectionless man to be buried, please attend service.

What's the point of it all, if at the end of the day, I have everything and nobody to share it with.

I don't want to be taken advantage of so I won't buy companionship or anything like that, but that just leaves me as a forgotten cog in a broken machine.

In five years, I lost 90% of my support network at best, pushing it towards 95% at worst.

Friendships were lost, strained, crushed and shattered, either by my fault, their fault or somewhere in between.

But I think I'm the one who has most of the blame.

I've always been the common denominator... I don't know if it's my personality, my way of being, how I was raised or any other factor I don't even know...

The point is that I'm alone 95% of the time, and I probably have most of the blame. 

And loneliness is tearing me apart.

I can't focus on online classes, I haven't done the tasks my psychologist gave me for almost a month, sometimes I have cold feet, stomach churns, anxiety attacks... God, it's torture...

It's true, I don't love myself, haven't done so in at least four years... Because, if almost no one cares about me, if I always make people snap or ditch me, if I always make a mistake no matter what I do then...

We would talk a lot about meeting up and kissing, and stuff like that.  I've never been close like this to someone before and it all was so exciting. Well.. she lives a long way aways and I was planning to meet her but a very bad event happened to me recently that messed me up so I couldn't go. I've been feeling really lonely and I think my constant messaging started to wear her down (I moved recently). She started growing distant and I felt more and more lonely,  and it just kept getting worse. Well today she told me she met someone and they started dating, and my heart just broke.

&amp;#x200B;

Im on vacation this week, took 2 weeks off work, Me and my mm n dad decided to go up north to Michigan's UP and check ut Maciniac and the UP Waterfalls and all that. Don't get me wrong, I had fun. It was enjoyable. Plus spending time with the folks while I still can is amazing. But no matter how much fun I had, it still was depressing. Seeing all these couples, and young families enjoying thier vacations together. Seeing mom n dad how happy they were together. And here I am, by my lonesome.

Hiking

Camping

Hitting the trails with the ATV

exploring

I'm at the point right now where I would rather be in front of my computer. 

Actually that was me today, and it triggered some serious depression and bad thoughts. 

I'm sitting at my cousin's house now, near some dunes and trails. ATV riders dream. Which was my idea to come here. My all-time favorite thing in the world to do is ride my ATV. But I'm at the point now where I don't want to. It's just not the same by myself. It's boring. IDK. Everything is boring by myself. Every damn thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, Im playing video games with a friend, or acquaintance. whatever. I actually felt like a human. Normal. Because I had that connection for once. I was forced off the tower to take the quad out and go riding. I cried the entire ride to the trails. Now I sit here staring at the other riders typing this up.

• Stop worrying what others think about you. Think about how the others worty about what you think of them. Everybody are very egotistical and worry about what others think about them all the time. Don't focus on yourself - Focus on them.

• Use body language when speaking. Especially speaking with your hands open, facing them. Makes you seem friendly and open. Also makes it appear more smooth and confident.

• Compliment - Compliment others when conversating. Makes them feel important and boostes their confidence. Will make them want to come back. You make them comfortable. Remember to be genuine and show show actual interest in them and their life. 

• Touch - Good for establishing closer relationships. Be confident, no half-hearted touches. Don't think too much about it. Make it natural. Ex. tap on shoulder, quick touch when passing person, hand on waist/around shoulder, hand shakes etc.

• Question - When conversating, ask open-ended questions to keep conversation going. Ex. Opinion about revent event/subject - compliment with your own opinion

• Humor - Being funny makes you attractive to others when socializing. Especially being able to laugh at yourself is important. Self-irony. Laughing at your insecurities will make you a lot more comfortable. Don't take life seriously. Being funny also makes others comfortable being around you and makes them feel safe with you.",lonely,Social hacks. How people make friends i guess,2020-09-20 02:49:37

My friends a really good dancer so he gained quite bit of following. This particular girl with whom we both share a mutual friend was clearly attracted to this guy was praising him for this dance and asked me if  I was a dancer too, to which my friend answered for me saying I was an artist (I would've just said, I am nothing) to which she replied something in the lines of, ""Then I don't care, you can go"", ""but you.."" points at my friend and continues talking. In her defense I think she was a bit drunk and obviously she can say whatever she wants to but It did scar me, I've always been insecure. I can't dance or sing, all I can do it draw and make shitty things.

I mean it all took one coincidence (she going to the club the day he was performing at) for two people to get together. Today I posted a animated short and guess who didn't give a rats ass.

Said we were best friends rather than in love. And now I'm broken. I have no one. Not 1 single friend. My family are a bit of a mess so I can only handle them for short periods of time.

1004,Zypher_Project,1600507827,1,"The past couple of years have been tough trying to find that special someone. I talked to 1 girl last year we became good friends, i did my best to try and keep her, i cooked meals for her, i wrote her a song, we played videogames together. Then all of a sudden she just stopped talking to me, I tried to reach out to her but i got nothing. It really fucked me up mentally and i thought i was being a problem to her, so i tried not to bother her anymore. I got worried sick that something happened i tried to reach out to her friends but they knew nothing. It fucked me up so much that she stopped because i really wanted her to be that special someone in my life but i guess it wasn’t meant to be. A month later i get a text from a friend saying that he was really sorry because she was also seeing the same girl i was seeing, he said that they slept together. When i saw the message it felt like i died, my heart stopped beating, i was betrayed by both people that i was friends with. Ever since i’ve been afraid to keep a close friendship with a girl,  i can still talk to girls but i just can’t pour my feelings to someone like that anymore, i guess you can say i have trust issues now.

A year later i tried to get out of my comfort zone and see if i can meet someone new, eventually i did. We both had the same similarities we both loved cooking and food, I was having a good time with her. Eventually she got to the point where she was interested and she said she “loved me”, so there i go blinded by love i make a nice dinner for us and after i ask her if she would like to be my girlfriend and told me that i needed to be a little more patient, so i waited. One night she calls me saying how much she loves me and i say the same thing back, a day later some guy calls me angrily saying that it was her boyfriend, i managed to settle everything down and i told him he wouldn’t have to worry about me at all. I blocked all communications with her and him, again i felt betrayed. It seems like I’m so unlucky with girls, once everything looks like it’s going so well it just manages to fuck up all the time. 

I’m still on the lookout for someone, I probably won’t have much success with the way things are going, but I’ll try my best. Until further notice ill be an owner of a lonely heart.",lonely,Owner of a lonely heart.,2020-09-19 19:30:27

It started because I’d always get anxious when someone touched me so I playfully slapped them or pushed them away, but throughout my years of knowing them, they’ve assumed it’s because I don’t like being touched... which is very much wrong.

These days, when I’m alone and about to go to sleep, I find myself crying a lot. Why? Because I’ve lacked human touch my whole life. My parents don’t show affection through touch or words because that’s how they were raised. No one has rly hugged me because I hide my sad emotions in public well enough that no one needs to pity me.

Deep down, I crave human touch. I want to be hugged, cuddled even. I want to be touched. I remember reading this quote in a book about how the main character is crying to be touched, but she’s so scarred, that she is like a barbed fence wanting to be touched. I feel like I can relate to that quote as I also deal with depression and have self harmed. I feel like a barbed fence wanting to be touched but instead of just my scars, it’s also my aura of being an asshole who doesn’t want to be touched that’s preventing people to hug me.

I’ve known these three people for a while, but none of them know I would die to have someone hug me. Every single night I’m crying and crying in bed, imagining what it would be like to be less lonely in this world.

1038,Shitty_sam7,1600485770,1,"I have a really hard time opening up to people and I feel like that is because of abuse in my family from a young age. Because I can’t open up easily it’s harder for me to get a conversation going and when it does get going, it’s awkward as fuck and is only small talk. I feel like nobody really cares about me and honestly I don’t care about myself at this point.

I’m an introvert too. I hate myself for it. I miss so many fucking opportunities because I can’t talk to people and when I do I feel more empty inside. I feel like emptiness is filling me. I don’t even try to talk to people anymore and I feel like I’m in a hole with no escape. On the outside I look like a normal introvert but I am in so much pain. I masquerade as a confident guy even though on the inside I am eating away at myself. 

Even when I speak to the few friends I have I feel empty and shallow. I feel like I will never be like them and they will never get to understand what I really am and they only like who I pretend to be just so I can keep them around. I feel lonely even when I do talk to them. I feel like I cannot connect with anybody. 

The most depressing thing is I have hurt everybody around me in one way or the other. I have hurt every single fucking person I have ever cared about. And not even purposely either. I have had close “friends” hurt me in ways that are unimaginably painful to the point where I almost ate a .38 bullet. 

What scares me right now is the fact that I am feeling more and more numb every single day. I don’t feel happy or sad. I don’t really feel anything anymore. Everything is just gray and unchanging. There isn’t any excitement anymore there isn’t any despair. Every day is blending into the next. 

When you’re an introvert and people don’t know much about you and you actually trust somebody and they stab you in the back with a rumor, that is one of the worst things you can face. Nobody cares to get to know you so they assume all rumors about you are true. I see people calling me names behind my back and every time I do I don’t even feel like a person anymore. I’m just some thing walking around pretending to be normal even though I’m just a piece of shit.

I just wish I never existed. It’s already like I don’t exist anyway because nobody wants to be around me if they have the choice. If I disappeared who would notice? If they noticed would they care? If they did why should anybody care about me? What do I do to deserve compassion all I do is hurt people and bring  negativity anywhere I go.

I feel so empty. I feel like I want something but I don’t know what I want. All I want is for this desire for something inside me to stop.",lonely,I’m that one guy people know of but nobody actually knows,2020-09-19 13:22:50

I feel like I can’t connect with people. It starts out fine, but then something always seems to come up-
Whether it is incompatibility of personalities, mental health, life problems in general, etc. 
I can’t remember the last time I genuinely connected with a person irl face to face who was not my family or a coworker. Especially since Covid. 
Online friends are great and mean the world to me... but the lack of in-person connection ends up being a bit painful after a while... 
the idea of meeting and making new friends irl seems so unrealistic and hard... 
I feel like I’m at a point that even if I did meet people- I would be so socially awkward and not know how friendship works when I can literally just call someone and meet up or go hangout in person with them... I feel so weird in a bad way for the fact that I don’t even know how to do things that should be so normal and straightforward. I overthink a lot which does not help. But still.

But it just sucks, especially at night, the feeling of loneliness.
I miss my old friends, people who were still sort of friends to me even though I was useless at being a friend. I miss having a family.

I am a female now in my late 20s, with no experience with the other sex whatsoever. I always believed in finding 'the one', saving myself for that person, but over time I realized I'm just a freak so that'll ever happen.
I was always discouraged from taking care of my appearance. After relatives, strangers etc commenting on my 'prettiness' I realised that I wasn't ugly after all. My father would always make sure to tell me, after getting my ears pierced with my best friend at 13, or finding my razor (for my underarms, not even my legs!) that I shouldn't focus too much on my appearance, that it was 'wrong.' My parents never bought me clothes growing up, I always wore hand-me-downs, faded or oversized. I was teased and bullied a lot.

Anyway, fast forward to now, I realise that my parents prob have undiagnosed mental health issues, my mother doesn't want anyone to outshine her (narcissist?), she was fine with my sister, she could take the compliments from outsiders, but she and my dad wanted me to be 'ugly' forever. It didn't help that my brother also bullied me as a teenager, and would verbally abuse me if I tried to make myself look nice...

Anyway, I digress. I just don't feel I'll ever be worthy of any friend or partner, because I'm just so socially inept and odd from years of isolation, not to mention I haven't achieved all the milestones expected of me by society.

But now I have the horrible idea of just downloading an app and just seeing if I can start gaining some experience, but I feel like the world will just laugh at me, and it'll never happen.

I have zero experience and I feel so stupid even thinking something can change. I know that some people had crushes on me in school (before I went to an all girls school), but they didn't know how weird I was. I very very rarely go out, and besides my creepy doctor going on about how beautiful I was, the only other time someone approached me was last year in a cafe by some kind of sort of over friendly guy, who chatted with me for almost two hours, asked for my number, went into a long story about all his past relationships, and then wanted to meet up the next morning.",lonely,"Alone, no hope?",2020-09-19 11:41:27

I used to tell him about my day, my dreams, plans, and everything, and he would talk to me about his life. We even used to watch movies together and would discuss them afterwards. We understood each other so perfectly that both of us agreed that our mental health was improving by talking out stuff we always kept to ourselves. I curse myself for getting too attached. But I just couldn't help it, talking to someone everyday, day and night and then suddenly stopping, really fucks your head up. We didn't have a fall out though. He had some shit going on his life and he needed space. I understand that completely and have no issue with the giving space thing itself. But it's just I can't stop thinking about what if I never hear from him again. And what if I'll never find a person who would listen to me, and take interest in my endeavours/plans and spend quality time with me like that, albeit online. I never had that kind of connection with any friend before. I also think I have abandonment issues which stem from being ghosted in past, and I know I am being kinda unreasonable and selfish.

1098,1mJustugly,1600436579,4,"
Hi everyone, i'm a 17 yo guy and i'm having serious problems with my self esteem. I'm EXTREMELY shy with everyone too, especially with girls. But let's start from the beginning: I've always had very strong insecurities about my looks, so i costantly feel myself as ugly and of course this leads to self esteem problems too. Also the fact that i've never had a girlfirend, and this really destroys me, cause i'd like to have a long term relationship with a special person...

I've got a very weird hair scalp, so i look like i'm balding even if i'm not. But, anyway, i think i'll lose my hair completely in 1 or 2 years so i think i'll cope with this. Last day, i kept my hair long so i didn't notice this flaw that much but now that i've got the buzzcut, my classmates (especially girls) started ignoring me completely. (You can see some pics of me on my profile... in some i got long hair, in others i got buzzcut).

I just don't want to go out for a walk because every time i do that i see tons of handsome guys with very good looking girls, or even normal couples too... and i feel so out of place, cause i don't think i'll ever be able to talk to a girl, and surely they won't approach me either, cause they're all used to model-like dudes on tik tok and so on ( i deleted all my socials cause seeing those popular and good looking dudes was just making my life worse than how it actually is).

I'm generally very introvert too, but i like that most of the times: i like thinking, creating... i'm not very comfortable in groups of people. the only thing i don't like, as i wrote, is that i never had a gf and i don't know how to interact with girls. My only female friend is my psychotherapist, but considering she just talks to me cause i pay her 70$ per week... and psychotherapy isn't working that much too.

I've not got firneds other than her and one other.

Btw, i've got a passion, and that's cinema: i like creating some movie plots and studying film directing ( i actually can't go to university cause i'm just 17, so i'm reading some books ). The problem is that i rarely spend time thinking about my hobby cause i always have obsessive thoughts about my looks and my awkwardness. I sometimes cry about that too...

That's all...  if you can help me, i'd be really happy to read your messages.

Just one thing: don't tell me looks aren't everything, cause they are a lot, it's just human nature.

I'd just like some suggestions to cope with this or, in the best case, to fight against this all. I was thinking about getting a job in 1 year time and do something that pushes me out of my comfort zone, like a cashier or a waiter, but my looks still block me from interacting.

Thanks

Btw, you think i'd look good bald? It's so sad to write this in at 17 yo...and would a septum piercing suit me?",lonely,How can i cope with loneliness? How can i improve my situation?,2020-09-18 23:42:59
1099,Odd-Tap6296,1600434361,4,"I was always discouraged from showing interest in girls being told that it's for adults and that I should focus on my studies. I heard this long after I already became an adult. After realizing how ridiculous that is, I assumed that I would meet people naturally. I was wrong and tried the following. 

A couple times I built up the courage to ask a girl out on a date. I hated this. I was terrified to do it and that when I finally managed, I was always rejected. The last time I did asked a girl out, I refused to call it a date. I had spoken to her several times and I felt like there was definitely a click there. She agreed and I probably saw five or six times. And they were the best days of my life. I really felt a connection with her and I thought she felt that too. I don't know why. The way she looked at me was new. No one had ever looked at me that way before. Anyway, I confessed my feelings and she told me that she just wanted to be friends. And that ended up not being true because she ghosted me after that. 

I thought I would try a ""serious"" online dating site. This one costs money but I decided to try it since it was advertised as being for serious long term relationships and it is the biggest in my country other than tinder. I got one match in two months. And after one message she decided that she wasn't interested. I canceled after two months since it felt like throwing money away.

Next, I tried tinder. I had really low expectations and I'm still let down. My hope was that in three months I could go on three coffee dates. And even though I've only been on it a couple of weeks, I can tell you now that it's not going to happen. I barely get any matches and when I do I never get any responses. 

The only thing I haven't tried yet is speed dating. I signed up a long time ago but needed to cancel. I still have the credit so I can attend an event without having to pay again. But I'm scared to go. I'm expecting it to go as well as my other attempts and if it does, then I will have exhausted all my options.

Which brings me to my point, I regret putting my self out there and going out of my comfort zone in an attempt to be happy because now I'm even more miserable than before since I can no longer convince my self that I'm alone by choice, that dating doesn't interest me.

It's really confusing and frustrating for me. I feel like there's something wrong with me, but I don't know what it is. Everyone else sees it. They see it immediately but I have no idea and would really like to know.",lonely,I regret trying because now it's not my fault.,2020-09-18 23:06:01

1102,Tacman215,1600433589,1,"Expressing your deepest, most sincere, emotions can be one of the most difficult things for you to do. Perhaps you feel like the emotions are temporary, or believe that there's no point in doing so in the first place; After all, one of the worst things that can happen is that we'll express our emotions and be met, only, with carelessness, (as if we were screaming into the void). It can be risky, brave, and much more to express how we truly feel.

To be clear, I'm not expressing myself to gain sympathy or to show courage; I'm simply expressing myself because it can be rather therapeutic for me.

I've developed serious trust issues over the years, possibly stemming from the negative experiences I've had in school. These trust issues have made it difficult to make or maintain relationships with friends; forcing me to avoid those who've wronged me in minor ways and making me hesitant to meet/befriend any new people.

 My trust issues, however, are only one ingredient within the recipe of my lonliness. The second ingredient is my belief that I'm nobody's first choice; I'm not the strongest, most organized, most talented, best leader, or the most memorable. At most, perhaps I'm the most trusting, possibly even considered funny within my group. I'm not even considered anyone's best friend. Simply put, I have an overwhelming belief that if I were to vanish they wouldn't take long to move on.

The third ingredient within the recipe of my lonliness is my terrible, terrible internet. I can't even count how many times I've been forced to be left out due to my inability to connect, though it's quite possibly in the triple digits at this point. I don't try to make it known to them, but it bothers me significantly. I want to try and make an economy world on Minecraft, however, despite only having one other person in the world, they complain about lag and other issues; All being caused by my internet. In general, I simply feel segregated from the friends I have 95% of the time, and that certainly doesn't make me feel good.

Despite my lonliness, possibly nearing depression in some regards, I try very hard to keep a positive attitude, however that can sometimes falter when I'm left to think within my own thoughts, (with nothing distracting me from the negatives). I'd like to think that sharing my thoughts will make me feel like some weight has been lifted.

After a few days the scene of the porn (where a guy is slamming the shit out of the shemale (trangender/ladyboy) started to come up in my mind it kind of started to kick in, So when my parents went on a trip, i Opened the transexual porn again and i watch it till hours (because been home alone) and finally after watching shit tons of transexual porn, I finally ejaculated.
so the transexual porn became my type of porn now this is where i started to watch it regularly and i even felt disgusted by it, but you know how porn grasp the brain. Si after watching transexual porn for like 11-12 months i felt the same way i felt when i was watching straight porn, I didn't got boner even watch 5-6 videos at a session.
Then i experimented (which was again huge mistake) I saw a video where shemale (transexual/ladyboy) fucks the men and that was something new to me and the same cycle repeated, and i started to become beta male.
While watching shemale porn i started to watch homosexual porn where i fantasies about beings the bottom (submissive) guy and watched tons of gay and shemale porn for 1 year, I didn't not got boner while having sex with a my girlfriend which led to breakup after few month because of lack of intimacy and after a while i was watch porn and i read comments on the pornhub about the subreddit called nofap and he mentioned it in a way that hit me, so just out of curiosity i downloaded reddit and followed nofap and started to read about nofap and its benefits, I realised what in a big hole i am in and the hole where i am stuck was created non other than Me.

I think there are two different types of alone, the mental and the physical. 

You have probably experienced both. Physical loneliness is when you have no one around you and a weak support system with a lack of friends and perhaps don’t get along with your family as well as you would like. Mental loneliness is the feeling of being trapped in your own mind. 

Your mind is a desolate place where it’s just you and your thoughts and this can be so positive if you train your brain and control your thoughts but for the majority of human beings we have not mastered this and sometimes(or all the time) feel like we are our thoughts and we get so consumed in them and this in my opinion is what creates the heavy sense of loneliness and the feeling of a lack of purpose. When I am out of my depressive states and I step back and just realise who I really am outside of my thoughts and emotions, a soul, a consciousness I can take away the power from the thoughts and regain my happiness however this Dosent change the fact that a lot of people misunderstand me if I tell someone I’m alone because I suffer more with the mental loneliness and if I tell someone I’m alone there first conclusion is ‘how are you alone? You have a mum who loves you and a friend group and family’ I know a lot of people go through this and don’t let them discredit your feelings and pain. I’m so grateful and love all those who love me, I know I am loved and not ‘alone’ by people I am yet to meet and every soul is just an extension of me in my opinion but that will never change the headspace of loneliness and the effects it has. 

No version of loneliness is worse. Mental loneliness manifests physical loneliness. Physical loneliness breeds mental loneliness. They all have the same symptoms. 

The goal for me is never to become less alone, it’s to find serenity in my solitude. 

I am working on my self every day and seeing the positives in every situation. My loneliness is a blessing which allows me to reflect on my self and see the world clearly. Every negative experience I have just makes me keep growing and evolving into a stronger, more open minded, caring person. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this it just felt like a good place to rant after another talking stage falling through with a girl and failing at LUV again but if anybody is feeling alone and needs someone then I really am here and care for you unconditionally. Just message me and we will go from there, we can talk about whatever you want and I’ll even sit on call with you at night if you need it if things are getting really bad. I promise your situation right now isn’t permanent and will change. I hope you all have a good night🖤",lonely,From one alone soul to another,2020-09-18 09:08:38

You feel as though you aren't good enough or important enough. And maybe we aren't. Maybe we aren't worth it like others. 

The thing about loneliness is you try to be strong for yourself until you crack. Until you aren't enough anymore. Realistically how long can someone truly be alone for? How long can you pretend? 

Because the truth is we need people. We need others surrounding us. Even if it's just one. We want human connection, we want to feel wanted. We want to be loved. Who doesn't?

I've been trying to stay positive all these years. My friends would describe me as the ultimate extrovert, I'm very social at parties, I'm funny and positive.  I'm fit, I'm attractive, I'm smart. I'm not trying to brag, but I know my worth and I know my weaknesses. Only a few know though how I feel deep down. 

I've really been trying to put myself out there. All dating apps in the book, sports clubs, parties, friends of friends. Ever since my last ex left (4 years ago) I haven't even been close to having a boyfriend again. And it's not because I never like anyone. In the past four years, I've probably really liked about 10 different guys (even had feelings for  few) and in the end they never wanted me. They would date me, sleep with me and then they would tell me they don't want anything serious. And I'm not going for the typical douchebag looking guys. I've been disappointed again and again and still I tried to meet guys.

When I was younger I always dreamed of having  family. A husband, kids and a dog. Now, at 32, this seems incredibly far away. A few months ago, I thought I got pregnant by a guy that I was seeing for about two months. How sad is it that I was almost hoping I was actually pregnant? Somehow I thought that this might be the only chance I'll ever have for having a child, even if I'd be a single Mom. 

All of my single friends complained about not finding anyone, and yet they all found someone. I'm the only one who never did. My best friend can't believe it and says my love live is jinxed. I don't know anyone who's so incredibly unlucky with dating. At this point I'm a 100% sure I'll end up alone. I guess I'll have to accept that the best thing that I can get dating-wise is good sex and some companionship. And I hate that this makes me sad, but it just sometimes does.

1146,QuoteExternal2731,1600355554,1,"I have dealt with suicidal thoughts and ideation as well as overall depression for the last 3-4 years. The main reason for my depression has been the fact that I am a 21-year-old virgin.

I lot of people close to me in my life have told me to consider seeking professional health and that I may have an underlying illness. I know for a fact this is not true, and I find this attitude to be completely disrespectful as it disregards the core issue of my mental problems. I will make a few points as to why I think this is the case and wanted to see what others think, or if I really need help.

As a psychology major and aspiring doctor, my understanding of mental illness as it pertains to depression is that it's a permanent, biological issue within the human brain. People who have Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Dysthymia (PDD) have a literal chemical imbalance in their brain, meaning their reward systems and networks do not function properly even if they engage in activities that are fulfilling. If we apply this to my case, it becomes clear I do not have a permanent illness as I will obviously be incredibly happy and fulfilled when I lose my virginity.

This indicates that my depression and suicidal thoughts are not the result of an illness, but rather a result of the fact that my ideal self is not aligned with my true self. Evidently, I want to have sex, and I am so pathetic and worthless that I cannot even achieve the one thing in life that I have wanted. For anyone familiar with Carl Rogers, this idea relates to his concept of self-actualization, which he believes is best achieved when your ideal self and actual self match.

Additionally, negative experiences cumulated in my life have also affected my mental health, not relating to illness. My entire life I have been reminded just how worthless everyone views me because I am a virgin. I've been told that the only thing I'd ever amount to was being a cuck in a porn movie and that I resemble the school shooter from Columbine. You cannot develop healthy self-esteem if this is how people view you. I've tried my best to get better, but when people have hated you your entire life for simply working hard, keeping your head down, and being a little quiet while you pursue your goals, it's difficult to believe any of the work you do actually matters.

In the past years of my life, I can't even be proud or feel accomplished as I work towards my ultimate goals of becoming a doctor and scientist. People have only ever made me feel ashamed of my intelligence and the work I put into my education. Even at an elite university, there is no woman who values my strengths, as my weakness of being a virgin seems to outweigh any other positive experience or achievement in my life. I, quite frankly, am tired of living this way and would love for a way to end my own life without it negatively impacting others.

I simply wish people would understand why I am so depressed and alone instead of just chalking it up to mental illness and calling it a day. I wish people actually listened to men like me and would understand that anyone would feel suicidal, depressed, and alone if they lived the life I have lived.

No sane, rational man wants to be a virgin for this long, and calling that depression or mental illness is incredibly disrespectful to the people who actually suffer through those diseases.",lonely,I hate it when people blame my mental state on illness rather than the circumstances of my life.,2020-09-18 01:12:34

No one cares and no one's coming to help. This is my life for the next few years since everyone at my school is either miserable and rude or just doesn't care. Don't they feel lonely too?

I'm a 23 year old single dad and have always struggled to build strong connections with people.  
I have a couple friends who I used to be very close with but that seemed to change after I was told I had a 1 year old daughter with an ex who basically disappeared ghosted me who I still haven't completely got over, I tried to do the right thing by being involved as much as possible with my child which eventually led to me becoming her soul guardian due to her mums drug problem.  
Shes 4 and a half now and obviously I've had to give up the majority of what little social life I had to take care of her and set our life up. I have always tried to maintain at least fortnightly phone contact with the same few close friends and family I have, but ever since I had to start focusing my attention towards my daughter 4 years ago my relationships have slowly dwindled to the point where some of them openly insult me.  
I just try to laugh it off but its obvious they're trying to get some sort of reaction. At times I will try to talk to them about it and let them know I don't mean to be anti-social and when it seems like they understand its back to the insults a week later.  
With that said and the fact that I already struggle to connect with new people, I'm starting to feel like my life would be a lot easier if I just cut out all social interactions (other than with my daughter).  
I know I still have to keep contact with my ex for our daughters sake but its difficult cos I'm still trying to lose my feelings for her when I'm not sure if she ever had any for me (I know its pathetic) so I combat it by just handing the phone straight to my daughter.  
And I still keep in contact with my mum and sister so my daughter can know them but other than that I don't see the point in socializing anymore.  
It gives me no enjoyment and is exhausting.

I share these thoughts to my partner and few close friends sometimes, and they listen and give advice.

1171,psydie,1600326864,1,"We all deserve honesty, so here it is. You’re not lonely because you’re unattractive, your personality is just repulsive. I’m tired of seeing people complain about being lonely because they’re “unattractive” or because they’re “too nice.” Are looks an important factor? Absolutely. Look aren’t everything, but it’s what draws us to someone else.. however, personality is what we stay for. I’ve dated a handful of guys who I wasn’t initially attracted to because they had more to offer than looks, they were kind, they made me laugh, and they were interesting to talk to. Girls do go for nice guys, you just aren’t as nice as you think you are. I’m tired of the “nice guys finish last” trope, you’re not finishing last because you’re a nice guy, you’re finishing last because you’re entitled. You’re nice to a girl for five seconds and expect her to express an interest in you, and when she doesn’t, you turn into a dick. 

No one owes you a damn thing. Just because you’ve expressed feelings for someone doesn’t mean they’re required to feel the same. You can’t force someone to love you or even like you. It’s so easy to place the blame on everyone else rather than admitting your own faults. Maybe you’re alone because you have qualities that some may deem to be displeasing. There are a multitude of reasons for why you may be alone, and most of them have nothing to do with your appearance. Take some accountability and stop blaming everyone else for your problems.

While I don’t regret my path, it’s been incredibly lonely. And I don’t think it’s going to get any easier. It weighs on me - how alone I am. 

To say no one would understand this would be foolish - I’m sure many people have felt listless in their loneliness before me. And yet that’s precisely the feeling. Isolated. Ignored. A forgotten person. 

I don’t think I’ve ever felt unworthy of love. I love who I am. But no one has ever reciprocated the same level of love I give. Maybe no one can. 

There is loneliness that meanders its way to your heart and takes hold. I’ve been alone for so long I don’t know the value another soul could add to my life. Why share my passions, my joys and pain with someone to have them go unappreciated or dismissed?

But I decided to take it as a sign, even if a minuscule one. So today, Wednesday I had that class with her again. We got randomly assigned to a group(which I was hoping for). We talked about the reading and that was basically it. When she started talking to the rest of the class she was super nervous and I private messaged her to take a breath and that she was doing great. After this we talked for the rest of the class, paying attention in between the private chat. We both have social anxiety(explaining why she was so nervous). We talked about a lot, music, our majors, our minors, and our interests. At this point, I found that we were very similar people. So I sat there for about 3 or 4 minutes thinking and basically tried to think up a way to either get her number or give her mine. So I ended up giving her my number and told her if she ever wants to talk or anything like that to text me. This seemed like a risky move but the worst she could do is say no. So... I got a text from her and we talked for a while after class. So we talked more about ourselves and I am just so happy for once with myself.

1199,letmepolltheaudience,1600309735,1,"I lost my job and had to move out of my apartment in San Francisco. I came to stay with my parents for a while. They live a tiny town of in the country in Washington. All of their neighbors are in their 70s and white. I’ve been so lonely and starved for human interaction my demographic (early 30s and ethnically diverse).

I met one (white) guy on a dating app who seemed nice but he has stopped responding to my texts. He had moved here from Denver so I was hopeful we’d get along and be each other’s support system. I don’t know what happened... Can’t force interest I guess.

Then I met the (white) granddaughter of a neighbor who is a few years younger. She’s studying to be a nurse and likes horses. I thought she had potential. She invited me to lunch with her friend and I was so excited. I showed up and both (white) girls were wearing camo. One of their dads and one of their husbands (again, all white) decided to come last minute, too. They were both wearing Trump trucker hats. One even had buttons on the sides.

I’m the only person of color I saw all day. Everywhere I went, everyone immediately knew I was new in town because I don’t fit in.

The husband said “I thought you were Mexican.” And I said, “No, I’m half Muslim Turk and half Catholic Filipina.” I tried to joke and say that I raise the diversity of the town by several points. He told me “You should just say you’re Mexican.” I was truly baffled. What?! I didn’t know how to respond. I think I asked him his thought process and he said something like “It’s just easier. You look it.” Or something else totally low key racist.

Later, I explained that I had an interview for a job in Australia. He said, “Oh no, you don’t want to go there. They’ll make you get vaccinated.” This literally made me pause, because both of the girls at our table - his wife - are nurses. I was like... “I don’t see anything wrong with vaccinations.” “Sure, but you have no freedom to choose. Don’t you want the ability to choose?” “If the government is providing a vaccination to keep the population safe and healthy in the midst of a pandemic, I fully support that decision, especially if I live on an island.”

I’m so frustrated and so lonely. I don’t have a support system or anyone my “kind” here. I feel like being here and opening their minds to new people and perspective might be low key my God-appointed role... I’m doing “God’s work”... But it’s not bringing me any joy or satisfaction. I feel misunderstood and so “other”.

I’ve always tried really hard to make friends. Not too hard of course, but I did everything right. I was a bit shy and awkward but I joined clubs, tried striking up conversations when possible, took risks, etc. I used to have a policy that I had to do 10 small things outside of my comfort zone everyday. My point is I’m not one of those people who complain about having no friends without trying to change my situation.

However, I never actually made friends. I made acquaintances, but not friends. And it was pretty clear before quarantine started that I was always the one initiating conversations.

Normally I’m anxious around people, but this year I’ve been feeling pretty apathetic. First day of school I decided to see if *anyone* would say hi, ask how I’ve been, comment on how long it’s been etc. See if I even slightly mattered to anyone. No one. Not one single person said anything. And I’ve just kept that up since. 3 days in now and I haven’t said a word and no one has said anything either.

I know this isn’t the healthiest way to deal with something, but I feel the results have been telling. I truly don’t matter to anyone. I could vanish tomorrow and nothing would change. No one would care.

At this point, I’m kinda curious to see how long I can go with literally not talking before someone says a word to me.",lonely,It’s been 3 days and no one has said a word to me,2020-09-17 11:36:11

4.) When i gather all eyes, it seems like no one truly sees me for me. They'll never understand the misunderstood.

5.) To be invisible is unintentional. I contradict both sides of my mind. sometimes from the world i want to hide or im sick and tired of not being recognized.

6.) Maybe i hide from being hurt inside so i have a mental disguise to be shielded from Judgemental eyes.

As much as I want to find someone new to talk to and find new friends i suck at it. I don't know how to maintain a relationship and I only know one friend throughout my life that I've known since 8th grade. The other friends that I've developed in my years of high school have moved on to their colleges and started on whatever they want to do with their life. After graduation I've lost contact with all of them. I won't ever see them again in my life anymore. Most of the time I find myself alone in my room daydreaming of a group of friends that I never had or a steady relationship with a  girlfriend. We would hangout for most of the week talking about the bullshit of our life, my make believe girlfriend would hug me and do what couples do and whatnot. However, that daydream might never be a possibility or a reality with all this COVID pandemic running around. Even if there was no pandemic I would still not find any courage or initiative to find or talk to people. I got anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem which leads me to hate myself. I can't look at myself in the mirror without feeling disgusted so I just look down and avoid looking at my reflection as much as possible. Heck, how can I love, care, or spoil someone if I can't love myself. My sense of romance or experience in a relationship is basically non-existent. I've thought of suicide so many times, but I'm not suicidal, but if I did would anyone other than family care. I've been lonely for a while now and the daydreams kind of help, but I will end up feeling like shit after a daydream. I snap out of it by reminding myself that it is only a dream, it wasn’t real, and it is only in your head and no one cares for you. No one is going to hug you, kiss you, hold your hand, spend time with you, no one is going to be waiting for you when you get home and greet you, and no one gives a shit about you, and I keep telling myself that it is ok for me to live alone for the rest of my life. That’s the only future I see for myself. Eventually I’m gonna end up alone. 

I don't really see myself living a long life and statistics say that loneliness is as lethal as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

There are a few scattered thoughts about how no one in my life wants me. They never initiate conversations with me, ask how I feel. 

I just feel absolutely alone. And my need for interaction has been eating away at me for the past few days. I was productive on Monday. And I really want to have the same state again where I am thinking about things other than interaction. And usually, the type of interaction I do have is on a discord server, which is just so stale and unsatisfactory. And it's happening there again. They never ask me anything. If I don't ask, they'd probably just ignore me. 

It's been two days now. I want to focus on myself and my studies. But, fuck this need for interaction which is becoming a pain in ass now. I feel more anxious than usual. I don't know how to forget about this thought again. I feel like a black hole attracting all sorts of unwanted thoughts. 

And what's more is that I don't have time. My classes are important to me. But I feel so anxious and impulsive all day that I simply cannot focus. 

I don't even care about making friends anymore. 

I just wanna focus again.

I'm always there for everyone who I care about, I'll do anything for them &amp; make sure they're okay, I make time for them &amp; go out of my way to tend to them.

1256,jkim088,1600269123,1,"All my life I have been pretty much alone. I was never a “normal” kid to begin with. I always hung out with girls when I was in kindergarten and only had one or two boy-friends in elementary school. Even those friends disappeared in middle school, so I was completely alone in darkness for 3 years. And when I finally got out of complete darkness, it was too late. I already forgot how to make new friends and now I barely have anyone I keep in touch with, not to mention I have never had any “best friend” everyone seems to have.

Where did it begin to go wrong, I don’t know. But what I know for sure is that deep inside my heart, I yearn for a friend, a true pal with whom I can share my most intimate feelings and journey our lives together. I don’t think it’s too late to have one, but the problem is if I will ever “have” one in my life. It’s questionable to think I would have such relationship when there’s no one who knows the “true me”, not the “fabricated me” designed to not make anyone uncomfortable. 

I am probably one of the most awkward and unpleasant human being you’ll ever meet. I basically lack everything except knowing how to get good grades, and even that is starting to falter in college. So the only thing I’m holding onto right now is to make lots of money as soon as possible to be able to live comfortably and do everything I want to the point where I can just forget about everything else that makes me “less” than other people and live a life I want—life that’s free from any rules defined by others.

1260,cassie_to_heart,1600266879,1,"In my search for prospective male **friendships**, I've decided to spruce things up a bit *(as well as marginally improve the quality of this sub of taking the leap of faith in extending an invitation)* in terms of finding guys I could be receptive to in terms of my nerdiness. Maybe a fellow nerd? Or someone more different whom I wouldn't expect to get along with?

**About me:**

21, Mtf *(untransitioned atm but looking towards transitioning in the future)*, from Australia. The unpleasant part is that I dropped out of my semester units doing a Nursing degree; which was fast-tracked after I did my prior degree in a B.S. Science; double majoring in Biology and Human Biomolecular Sciences (Anatomy &amp; Physio). So I'm pretty much in the phase of assessing my life, in particular, reflecting with myself in what career options I'd like to explore in terms of it matching it with my interests/hobbies.

I was studying to become a military flight nurse or if that path didn't work out, alternative is to go towards the path of being a DoD civilian nurse *(of some kind)* at an Army hospital or Naval medical center, provided with a dual US/Australian citizenship. Unfortunately, my interests/hobbies make it hard for me to connect with anyone. Some of them include: listening to police scanners, watching military MRE reviews and aviation/commercial flight trip reports.

However, due to in part with my many mini-depressive episodes of loneliness and isolation *(no it's not due to 2020 or COVID)* which has been chronic for years, I haven't engaged with some of my interests recently or things I'd like to do in my pastime.

In all honesty, I feel as a civilian, that I am unable to connect much with the civilian world, with a few exceptions *(geez I sound like a POG complaining of the most POG'est unit)*. There is enough personal experience to warrant my choice and decision to leave any friendships and move on to the chapter of making ones with people in the military background, and to an extent, those with a law enforcement background.

I also gotten back into reading, being quite a bookworm before.. Right now, I'm reading ""*Towards a New Maritime Strategy: American Naval Thinking in the Post Cold-War Era"".* On the watch-list right now is *""On Call in Hell - A Doctor's Iraq War Story""* by CDR Jadick once I finish (based on Fallujah). However, I've too read other books including: *Shortest Way Home* , W*inter of the World/Edge of Eternity* book series, *The Strain*, *Wayward Pines* book series, *World War Z.*

With music, I got some songs/soundtracks to offer you! My favourite ones are from *Bear McCreary - Two Funerals/Pegasus/Prelude to War/Kat's Sacrifice/Admiral and Commander* and *Something Dark is Coming*. But *Kat's Sacrifice* and *Two Funerals* takes the cake for me... and I encourage you to take a listen.

I've been getting compliments that I'm a kind, intelligent and gentle woman, even on a basis of friendship alone.

***What is something that makes you think you can impress guys in terms of geekiness?***

* I can tell you the USMC rank insignia, from E-1 to E-6 (despite not serving in the MC)
* I somehow know some (not all) the MOS of Army/Marines (you can quiz me if you'll like)
* I can pinpoint on the map, name several, close to a dozen US counties... yep that's right counties.
* Doing a rudimentary analysis on the US political landscape (and political history of the state), keenly try to analyse US election national and battleground state polling data... even once had a dream a few days ago on election night predictions! Hence, I'm an avid US political junkie.

**What I desire:**

I crave and desire connections with guys who believe in the mantra of long-term friendships, almost akin to camaraderie.

My flaw is that I tend to do things and sort my problems alone *(not by choice)*, because I usually have no one to turn to, at least save for several online male friends I talk to semi-regularly, though they live on the other side of the world. ***One important tidbit, they're all former or current military***. **Furthermore, I have one intimate correspondence with a guy (civilian) that I am extremely close who has by far, earned my biggest trust in him.** Given that, I may come across as rather cautious when it comes across to other guys.

For one, I'd like to be specific in my search and from personal experiences, the more specific you are, it shows one's willingness to be determined in what you're looking for.

I've learned through time, that the past friendships I've had in the civilian world could not compare in terms of willingness and desire to actively nurture connections, often forgotten. Simply put, you're on your own out here *(familiar sentiment?)*.

Moreover, there is enough unspoken dysfunction to know we aren't always obligated to 'fake it till you make it' when we have those moments in life and we can be real with each other in terms of vulnerabilities.

Anyways, if you think you fit the bill, looking forward to hearing from you *(and kudos if you've managed to reach this far)*

For verification purposes, any interested guys include their MOS and the phrase ""Applesauce"" *(dare I say it's a huge bonus if you're a combat arms one...cue the friendly competition/rivalry with POGs).*",lonely,21F - Lonely (trans) gal feeling like a black sheep in the civilian world,2020-09-17 00:34:39

1263,ObsiBerithos,1600264307,1,"So here it goes: I'm 32 and my boyfriend is 22. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now. This post is very hard for me to type, even now, since my anxiety is through the roof over the situation I'm in. When we first entered a relationship, my bf was very kind, feminine and attentive. He did everything for me and gave me all of his time. He eventually got a job working for his father and showed genuine interest in making a life together. After a month of working for his father, he quit out of frustration and laziness... that's when things began to go downhill.

My bf started changing in small ways: playing more online games with his friends and arguing with me over many things. We often fight in the way where I pose a complaint about something and he becomes immediately defensive and ignores me and the issue. About a month ago he ended a friendship with his closest male friend and began making even more time for his school friend, over online gaming. He still doesn't work, won't be going to school anytime soon (to finish his high school degree) and at this point, I feel like he squeezes in time with me, between his gaming with his friend. As soon as he wakes up, his friend and him game -- and on and off throughout the day they game (I've become a leftover past time, in a sense). 

He knows what he's doing isn't fair or kind. Sometimes he gets upset with himself and apologizes for being a crappy bf (after he takes his frustration out on me through a passive aggressive way), but then a day later he goes right back to the same routine. I feel so alone and not at all a priority. I really don't know what to do. He wants to marry and have a baby with me, and tells me he's very in love with me (I'm the most important person to him, he reminds me)... but since I'ts been this exact way for about a month, I just can't take it anymore (I don't see any hope in sight).

If a teenager commits a mass shooting or murder they're sentenced to life in jail and people will hate him/her and have every right to do so. Said teen knew what they were doing and should be held accountable. People arent going to brush it off and just say he/she was just a kid. 

Honestly the people who want true gender equality (not that theres anything wrong with that) are the ones who demonize sexual relations with teenage males and adult women. The ones who always complain with their ""oH bUt SwITCh tHe GenDERs"" bullshit.

I recently read a post here on r/offmychest about a guy who said he had sex with a woman who was 23 when he was still in highschool. I don't know if the woman was attractive or not (i hope not due to envy) but if she was that just makes me feel fucking jealous and bitter. 

Im underage and if a beautiful older woman (or pedophile if you wanna call it that) wanted to have sex with i would be ecstatic.

Single

Stopped attending Architecture School after the last semester ended with no intention to continue pursuing my degree.

My high school friends are all strangers now.

Any friends I made in uni have forgotten that I ever existed.

The last group of friends I was close with became incredibly toxic the longer I was friends with them - all because I was older than they were and that they suspected me of being gay.

Well, I am gay. Closeted.

But I never bullied them for their imperfections despite the temptation to retaliate.

I even listened to their insecurities and tried to be a positive voice.

In the end I had to leave, feeling emptier than when I first arrived.

I never thought I could cry yet be unable to shed any tears.

I grow tired of shallow friendships and crave for that one friend who I can talk to about literally anything without prejudice.

Most of the positive energy I get nowadays come from YouTube videos. But even that is a temporary solution.

They have full control of their choices. So if a rejection comes from seemingly nowhere, how is it the fault of the rejected? But the rejected is still blamed for being rejected.

1290,roboapp,1600237766,1,"Hello everyone. First time posting here. I've never really had the courage to write here until now.

I'm (M-29) and I don't really know where to start so I'm just going to start typing and hopefully I can explain everything. I've always felt lonely but right now with this whole quarantine going on has really been making things worse. Before this whole quarantine mess, I really started to get lonely after my last break up. Before I started dating her, I hadn't dated someone in 6 years by choice. All my previous relationships I had been cheated on so I decided to just stop dating and just focus on myself. I went to movies , museums, concerts by myself. You name it, I did it.  She was the first person who I really had some kind of feelings for. I wasn't actively pursuing a relationship. I wasn't even trying to pursue a relationship with her. She pursued me and at first I didn't want anything to do with her but she kept on trying to talk to me. She actually took the time to talk to me and whenever I felt like I didn't want to open up with her, she understood and never pried. After a while, she felt like someone who I can confide in. So it hurt when she broke off our 2 year relationship because she just wasn't in the mindset to have a relationship and then later found out from her that she just wanted to get back with her ex and she had been communicating and visiting him while she was with me.

After she broke it off with me. I spiraled into bad habits that I tried to stay away from. I started drinking more, I gained weight because I began to eat unhealthy food. It was horrible. I don't miss it. But I regained control of my life. I'm a college dropout. I never had the funds to really go to college so i had to drop out the end of my freshman year in 2010. After years of just doing nothing. I enrolled back into college and still currently going to college to get my degree. I started working out and stuck to a schedule. It was amazing I was finally going back into my groove of just doing things for me and no one else. Then COVID-19 hit and everything when spiraling down. I lost my jobs and my parents became ill so I moved back home to take care of them both. I've regained all my weight back that I lost and I feel lonely everyday. Even when I was working two jobs and going to class and then going to the gym everyday. I just feel empty. It's hard to explain but I just feel like I'm worthless and I can't shake this feeling that I'll never find someone again. It took forever to find someone who I thought I could relate to and have fun with. Now I'm afraid that I'm 29 and that's it. I won't find someone again. I know this post is everywhere. I'm not really that well and putting my thoughts together well.  I'm honestly not sure what I want from writing this post. I guess I just really wanted to get this off my chest. I feel like such a loser letting this get to me but It just eats at me every day. well whoever reads this, Thank you for taking the time to read it.",lonely,Loneliest I've ever been,2020-09-16 16:29:26
1291,donutfactoryrequiem2,1600237636,1,"Not to self-diagnose, but I have a mental health condition called ""avoidant personality disorder"". Apparently, it's an order of magnitude more severe than social anxiety, where you completely avoid social interaction, you never reach out to others, you never go out, nothing. One of the scariest things about AvPD is that you're so afraid of rejection that any time someone could reject you, you avoid that and stay at home instead.

For me, messaging others carries a great deal of rejection. Not like, ""they ignored you for 10 seconds, so you have to wait a few hours"", I mean like ""they ignored you forever, and they'll never talk to you ever again"". And if I probe into it, ""Why did they ignore me permanently?"" it's because ""they don't like me for who I am"".

It's one thing to not be wanted as a guy, but as a woman it's a whole other level of pathetic. I literally go days without getting matches on these apps and what's fucking wild is that I'm not even unattractive? I don't know what's fucking wrong with me that guys really don't see me as worth the effort. I seriously wanna fucking die. The ones that do match with me don't even wanna waste the ten seconds it takes to send me a message. They just use the app's automated prompt to invite ME to chat them up about something on their profile. Sorry, it's pretty hard for me to motivate myself to do that when I have never, and I mean *never* in my life been treated even a little gently by ANY man. Every man I have met including male 'friends' has left me some kind of scarred and I haven't even had a boyfriend yet! 22 years old and I have never had a boyfriend.

I'm a 'not worth messaging.' I'm a wolf-whistle. I'm a last minute date. I'm 'I can already tell the sex is gonna be insane.' I'm 'preachy.' I'm a 'foid.' I'm 6/10. Or 1 if the guy is in a bad mood. I'm 'let's Netflix and chill.' I'm 'I don't think monogamy is healthy.' I'm 'don't approach women in public, you'll get me-too'd.' I'm the woman you talk to when any breathing female thing will do.

And don't tell me I'm gonna be special to someone, or that at 22 I still have a lot of time. It's over. Men. Do. Not. Want. Me. Honestly I'm starting to doubt they even want love. This whole generation of men has been brainwashed into basically seeing women as 1. magic fairies that appear one day and make your whole life amazing, without any desires of their own besides making you happy 2. fuckholes/cum dumpsters/toilets. That's it. They've been conditioned using the pleasure reward of orgasm, plus social media, television, movies, etc to see women as the equivalent of furniture. It's over. They do not have the capacity to feel love and tbh I don't blame them! If most people had a choice between a magical fairy that makes their life perfect and cares about nothing but presenting her pussy/ass/mouth for fucking and scrubbing the shit stains out of your underwear vs a real relationship that requires effort then tbh who can blame them for wanting option A? Who would want the hard option that requires vulnerability and generosity and other virtues when you can just treat women like shit AND reap all the same benefits? It's over it's over it's over. Kindness has been conditioned out of this generation and I feel so stupid for even believing men were capable of it in the first place. Since I was a child men have treated me like shit. Over and over again they've cut me the fuck down and I just wish I could fucking sterilize myself so I could lose the hormones and be a sociopath or some shit. 

Honestly contemplating just going completely off the fucking deep end like they do. Sometimes I think about it.

It's been clear my entire life that I am not a person worth putting in effort for, at least not to men. I literally cannot imagine a scenario in which that is different. If I'm not wantable at 22 I'll never be wantable. Besides, men assume all women are used up whores by like 25 anyway. I'll never be special to anyone and the sooner I just kill the impulse to love inside of me the sooner I can live out the rest of my life in self-absorbed peace. While the earth rots around me. And love slowly becomes extinguished from the population. Maybe with Disney and Amazon controlling all the media soon we'll be brainwashed into thinking it's primitive. Wouldn't that be something. 

I don't even want comments tbh. I swear to god if I see even one 'focus on yourself queen!' i'm gonna lose my shit. Or if I see 'acTUAlly females are privileged because you can make an OnlyFans and whore yourself out for money and get lots of male attention that way!!!1' Shut up. Shut the fuck up. I'd burn OnlyFans and PornHub to the fucking ground if I could. Fuck men. Fuck men for hurting young girls and coercing them into those awful industries. Like do you hear yourself? Whore myself out when I want love because I'm delusional to want love. All I, all WE are to them is whores. It has been this way for thousands of years, I don't know why we'd assume it was different just because we got hopeful things would change. We are whores and servants to them. Whores and servants. That's all. No fucking wonder I can't find someone to talk to.",lonely,i'm starting to realize no man will ever want me,2020-09-16 13:30:57

1321,throwaway19092000,1600220633,1,"Heyy, my name is Pedro and I have 19 years old (I'll be 20 this saturday :))! 

I thought on writing this post since lately I've been feeling the need to vent with someone and honestly, I think that all my friends wouldn't understand me. 

I've been struggling with mental health issues in the last 2 years I guess and since then I've been really lonely. 

It's sad, because I used to be a very funny, outgoing person and now I changed a lot. I rather just chill alone and getting high so feelings can fade for a couple hours. 

It's like I got weird when I am meeting new people since the older I get, the harder it is to be 100% true to myself on a relationship.

When the quarantine started on my country (March), I ""decided"", (it was more like a thing that I did involuntarily), to just disappear and put my social life on standby so I could use all that extra time at home to find myself, set some goals, figure out some stuff, etc. 

Anyway, it really didn't work out, and I just passed most part of my days on bed and eating unhealthy food, while I try to study sometimes.

Sadly, these habits still remain and, after the end of the lockdown, I started to figure out that a lot of people that I used to hang out with and talk to just never texted me again or invited me to anything and I feel bad about it. 

I mean, don't get me wrong, I know my worth (sometimes at least) and I know that I did everything I could to keep in touch with a lot of people, but anyway it still hurts to see them all happy and hanging out a lot with different people while I'm trapped on these thoughts and on this situation.

So that's it, I would love to find a way to let this loneliness fade away, I just don't know how.

I would love to meet online friends here, so feel free to dm me.

Financially, I have a job but my parents have not worked for over 20 years. I am having some stress and burden although they only need me to give them $500 for my car &amp; insurance. They are also loners. I am a super loner, with barely any experience of going outside and having friends at all. I used to have one good friend in Elementary school. But that went shit after highschool because of a lot of jealousy between us and other reasons. I have never found anyone that I clicked with after...

I know I may have the feeling of being victimized, and its quite bad but its true... My love life is also terrible... I had 1 crush when I was 23 and it ended up badly. I had a girlfriend two years ago that cheated on me with same co-worker. I became a joke to my entire workplace and was the centre of gossip. People just talked shit behind and infront of me like they don't care. I am bad at talking/speaking and dont have friends so I am an easy target for people.

Another thing: there are not as much as lonely people, but people who cannot connect with other people just based on their preference levels e some other variables.

Does anyone else have like 0 friends to talk to? I mean literally zero! Let me explain. I’ve had quite a handful of friends growing up and it was great. I had people to hang out with during school( elementary- high school) and do things with on the weekend etc. But when I started college(2016) I never heard from any of my old friends so yep they ditched me and moved on. 

I had 1 friend in college freshman year, we were both biology majors. But the following year I switched majors and I never heard from her again. I struggled to really make friends with people in my major that I switched over to because I felt like they already had established friendships with other people. Back in late 2017- early 2020 I had a group of Internet friends. They were honestly the best people I met ever. They filled the loneliness I felt when I was all alone in my dorm room. I remember after class, I would get so excited to talk with them and play games with them etc. we almost felt like a family at some point. We were all pretty much close to each other, but now we don’t even socialize with each other anymore. It’s so sad we all grew distant towards each other, but hey that’s life tbh. 

Now I’m done with school completely and I’m practically friendless. I just do the same shit everyday. The only companions I have is food, music, games, tv and makeup. It sucks. I do have a best friend though. We’ve been friends since 2001 I think. But I personally feel like we’re not close friends anymore + at least she has a boyfriend to talk to. She’s kinda just like me too, she doesn’t really have friends either. So it’s just me and her boyfriend pretty much.

 Good things don't happen to me and that's something I'm used to, but I still need to learn how to handle these bad feelings, they put me down too often and take over my mind too much.

And it's not just them, it's been the same with my other ""friends"" too. I guess the last time I met one at my house was 2 months ago.

And yesterday I guess I even lost trust in my ""good friends"". The best friend of my good friend was ill, so she talked with her new best friend. The two literally ignored me all the way. For 90 minutes straight. They know each other for 2 months now, my good friend and me have been together for 6 years.
And it got even worse today. We had free classes in between, only 5 others I knew were in the cafeteria with me. My good friend, her new best friend, some girl and my ""other good friend"" just went to the city for 2 hours to have fun together. And they new I was there all alone and didn't care. I thought we were friends, but I got disappointed. I even heard those two I already mentioned talking about it yesterday. And today these other two joined in. I cannot deal with it, my heart feels so empty. Because everytime I talk to someone this good friend joins in and steals my conversation. She's getting so popular these days, she ignores me everytime when there's someone better around she can talk to. 

I don't want to be mean, but now I only have 2 friends in school left. One is the ill person, but since she's the other  best friend of the mentioned girl, I can't keep up talking to her. Also we hardly have classes together. So only my best friend's left and maybe you're thinking that's better than nothing. But no, she's getting more and more bored of me, she also rather wanted to walk with my good friend than with me today. I'm so hurt. Said good friend was so pure and now she's all backstabbing without noticing. I'm afraid to go to school again. I'm afraid of the vacation I have to spent alone and my upcoming 18th  birthday I have to spent alone. The only fun I have these days is cutting myself, but that's not what life should be. I wanna die, honestly, but I can't do this to my parents.
I just want my good old friends back and chat with the two girls and the other ones I met in classes, but I'm too afraid and scared. My topics are as boring as me, I never know how to start.

Um Hello there!



I'm a 19 year old mostly introverted guy and I'm looking for a lasting friendship!


Here are some of the things I enjoy -


*READING* - I like reading books. Um, I prefer reading philosophical, historical fiction, existential and lgbt books mostly. The Stranger, CMBYN and All The Light We Cannot See are some of my favourites.

*FILMS* - I'm a sucker for pretentious and indie/arthouse films, so it'd be cool to have someone to talk about that with. We could give each other our LetterBoxd accounts. My favourites are CMBYN, Pulp Fiction, Frances Ha, Lady Bird, Mommy, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Million Dollar Baby, The Lighthouse, Taxi Driver, Un Homme Qui Dort etc etc

*TV SHOWS* - I have watched about 56 shows. Yes, I keep count and I know I have no life. But that's what happens when you don't have friends, gotta fill the ever-growing void of loneliness inside me somehow. Ahem, anyways, some of my favourites are Breaking Bad, Mr. Robot, Fleabag, Euphoria, Rick and Morty, The Leftovers, The Sopranos, Russian Doll, Friends, The Office and moree.

*FOOTBALL* - I really enjoy playing and watching football. I'm a lifelong Arsenal fan and yeah, that's about it. I also like to bike sometimes. 

*MUSIC* - I usually listen to Rap/Pop Rock/Indie Alt. Eminem, J Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Halsey, Harry Styles, Lorde, Sufjan Stevens, Perfume Genius, M83, Fiona Apple, Of Monsters and Men, Queen, Blondie are some of the artists/bands I enjoy listening to.

*GAMING* - I don't think I can classify myself as a conventional ""gamer"" because I only really enjoy playing single-player games so I can escape reality and my crippling depression for a while and immerse myself into another world...jk sorry, i'll stop with the morbid jokes now. I really liked playing God of War, The Last of Us and Detroit. 

*SPACE SCIENCE* - Weee! I wanna become an astronaut! No, not really? I don't know, we'll see. I'm thinking of studying Mechanical Engineering in university and then doing a Masters in Aerospace Engineering and I'd hopefully like to work in the aerospace industry one day :)

*PHILOSOPHY &amp; ART HISTORY* - I got into Philosophy thanks to PEWDIEPIE! I really enjoy reading philosophical texts and books and trying to understand the ""mEaNiNG oF LiFE"". And I got into Art History thanks to Marzia lol. I just read articles about paintings and stuff mostly, it's fascinating.

Um yeah, that's about all I can conjure about myself to present to you and hopefully convince you to want to be my friend 👈

Also, I'd also appreciate if you could introduce yourself or tell me about your interests/hobbies when you message me :)

Welp, that's me. Hope you have a good day/night :)

Later!",lonely,I turn 19 in 3 days and I just realized I've never had a genuine friendship :/,2020-09-16 05:42:20

We started a fresh discord server and are still in the early phase of recruitment so haven't reached full activity yet! 
So we are eagerly looking forward to recruit more and turn the place into a nice comfy **close-knitted community**

The idea behind it is to have a place where You can spend your free time in, Use the place as a relaxation,To find friends, engage with others in  any topic from Philosophy to dumb memes; Just a place where you'll have a face and an individuality Instead of being a nameless person c:

We are still a bit far from reaching there so We would love to have you among us! 
Pro of joining early: The community is rather small right now so you'll not be overwhelmed or won't feel alienated into an already formed community, Would be very easy to fit in as of now!

Note: Since we are beginning, We ask for a bit of patience till full activity ❤️ , Till then we'll do our best to keep you good company
Note (2): Please Dm or comment with Atleast your ASL since verification would be needed to keep the place protected



Thank you so much for your time eitherway!",lonely,Small Discord server for you to socialize and hang out in ❤️ (16-26),2020-09-16 05:29:05
1353,throwaway1414147,1600196864,1,"I'm now already 23 and don't have any friends and have never had a relationship (or literally anything close to one) and I just don't get it. I try to go out and meet people but everyone fades away after a few weeks.

Tried finding friends in my area online but same thing, at some point they just give up on me. Sometimes after meeting up (I guess I must be terrible to be around or something?) And sometimes even before that. The only ""friends"" I've been able to make have been online in different countries where I don't even know if anything they tell me about themselves is true. And even then, most of them just disappear someday never to be heard from again. I recently thought I'd try it again on Reddit, but it feels like my ""friend making mana"" has been completely drained and I don't want to put in the effort anymore so I've become one of those infamous ghosters. What's the point of talking to someone on the other side of the planet if I just want someone to go biking with or something.

And as for dating: I tried dating apps, I always go into it optimistically thinking that if I don't find a partner then I might find some friends at least but no. Every single time I matched with someone, they were the ones I wasn't really attracted to but I still swiped them because I thought I might still be able to like them judging from their description. And no, my standards aren't too high, otherwise I probably would never match with anyone. But it was always the same thing, we talk for a few days but it always feels like I have to grab every single word and painfully pull it out of them because otherwise the conversation will just die. None of those girls seemed the least bit interested in me, I even asked them if they would say that they're shy and they said ""lol no, why"" so I don't get it. We matched, so you should show a little bit of Interest like Im doing? Here I also just lost all motivation because I'm pretty sure I know how it's going to end already anyway, and why should I set myself up for another failure.

So yeah sorry for all the words but I just don't know what to feel anymore. I'm lonely but I'm also just feeling like I'm ""done"" with all of this? Like if I have to decide between loneliness and disappointment after disappointment, I might as well just embrace the loneliness.",lonely,"How is this whole ""being a normal human being"" thing supposed to work",2020-09-16 05:07:44

1376,phantomblackwidow,1600174343,1,"*I've never written anything before, yet alone tried so... bear with me haha. Here's to my newfound single life, trying new things, and vulnerability. A random story that has absolutely nothing to do with anything I've experienced.*



     It was a gloomy Saturday night. The still rain had already settled its way into the cracks of the concrete sidewalk, and it was the collective pedestrians' turn to fill the near atmosphere with the sound of chatter, heel clicks, and wheels that all seemed to pass by, yet never end.

     I was headed north, no idea which way that was exactly... I was never good at directions. Based on the instructions the librarian had given me when I'd stopped in earlier to ask where the nearest bar is, I just knew that that's where I was going. *North, about five blocks down and to the right of the stop sign at Jennry Way,* she'd told me as she pointed across the road. That's where she was pointing, right? God, I hope.

     I shook off my doubts and re-paced my strut as I'd discovered a newfound, tiny confidence, reassuring myself that I was definitely headed the right way. Straightening my posture, my gaze followed and I looked ahead. I quickly exchanged a polite grin with a middle-aged couple, who were walking past at a much slower pace than I. *Was I walking too fast? No, they were walking pretty slow.. I must look insane. No, I just look busy. I don't know.*

    As I cut the next crosswalk, I turned around to check how many streets I had passed. Four...? I thought the walk would be much shorter. It felt like I had been walking for 10 minutes already. Craning my neck upwards, I double-checked the street name, whose characters were way longer than Jennry Way, so I hadn't thought twice about reading the entire thing. *Did I even read the last--*

   Very suddenly, I was deafened by the sound of a car's monotone and whiny honk in my left ear. Alarmed, I jumped so hard that my back tensed up, and I quickly sped up my walking pace, yet again, across a patient line of headlights. The car that was turning right, whose path I had interrupted *although I was in the right of way* resumed with a gravel-churning acceleration, and with a tiny tire splash, was unapologetically gone within a matter of seconds. I shamefully kept my head down as I crossed, avoiding any eye contact, and hoping that everyone else -- including myself -- would forget it in five minutes.

    My walk of shame had finally come to an end when I'd reached Jennry Way, and a twinge of hope had been resurrected somewhere deep, deep within. As I opened the bar doors, the smell of alcohol, mahogany, and hints of cigarette smoke-tainted clothing hit my nose all at once. There was no greeting at the door, but I felt welcome. I made my way over to the bar and sat down in the corner where I'd be the least noticeable.
    The bartender, per my request, had poured a shot of whiskey. When she passed it to me, I almost felt like I wanted to kiss it.
    ""Thank you."" 
     Or toast it. But I was alone... So I picked it up and internally toasted to myself. *Here's to... temporary amnesia.* It burnt its way down the hatch, but mama came prepared. That was just the first. I knew it would hit soon, so I should take it slow, but it was just a relief to be there. 
   I reached into my purse and unlocked my phone screen. 10 missed calls from my ex, 30 texts. I opened the text notifications.
    ""Please... give me one more chance. Your things are still here, I see you everywhere,"" turned into,
    ""You're making the biggest mistake of your life.""

Would you invite them to a cup of tea?

When they show their dominance, their power,

Do you guide them to your living room for a talk?

Because every monster were once a fragil seed, that feed himself from our fear.

When the monsters arrive, do you look them into their eyes?

Born of sorrow, guilt, anger, sadness

Are you capable of seeing your own fatherhood in them?

Strangely, they just need to know where they come from. Why they exist.

In the middle of the tea, you should them your world. Your soul.

They will see who they are. And you know who you are.

Then you invite them to leave and find their path.

They will invite you to go with them. 

And you make them understand that they will  go and  they return.

Because everything and everybody will go and return.

Overcoming is understanding that the monsters will go and return,

And our job is to invite them to a tea, navigate into their existence and then

1381,Lucigucifer,1600167822,1,"(Repost from off my chest. Seems like a better fit here)

Before I left my home for a gap year, I was miserable. I had gained a lot of weight, and my mom constantly body shamed me. I fought with my parents all the time. My hair was falling out from the stress. I had graduated highschool early, and all of my friends from school stopped contacting me. 
When I went to Europe, I started to lose weight from walking everywhere. I made friends. These people treated me so kindly that I’m starting to think it was my first time having real friends. I finally felt like my life mattered. In high school, people ignored me when I talked. So I stopped talking. In Europe, my friends looked at me when I spoke. At one point I got too sick to go on an outing, and when they came back I was told that it wasn’t the same without me. As soon as they shut the door, I broke down. I couldn’t believe that they saw me as anything other than a burden, let alone missed me. I felt like I was being seen as a human for the first time. In the pictures I sent home, I was always smiling. My family said they’d never seen me like that.

Not only did I have friends, but people were interested in me romantically. Another thing that seemed impossible before. These experiences changed how I thought about myself. I couldn’t even look at myself before this.

But now I’m back home, and my friends from the hostel have been texting less and less. It’s so hard to stay in touch when you live in different countries. I’m stuck. And when I think about Covid and how poorly it’s being handled in my country, I’m terrified that I won’t be able to leave for a while, maybe years. Which to me means that I can’t experience the happiness i described above (until borders are opened again)
Not to mention I’m still living with my mom, who is not very good at being a mom. (Too much to go into there) It feels like I’m regressing. I was so confident last year, and now that I’m isolated again, I can feel myself getting weaker. I used to think I was an introvert, but I think that was a way to cope with being alone. I realize now that I love knowing people. When I think about my future I can’t see it anymore. There is nothing certain in my life except that I am alone again, and when that thought comes to me, it feels like I’m drowning in freezing cold ink.",lonely,"I thought I was an introvert until I found friends for the first time, and now that I’m alone again I have no coping mechanism (tw suicidal ideation)",2020-09-15 21:03:42

1389,Neposedny,1600158753,1,"Well here it comes, my first post ever. I just feel to share my thoughts here.

So I am a guy, who live alone and have couple of close friends. Had 2 relationships, but both ended like 3 months after. In the first one I broke up with this girl, which was just making excuses for me. It was like I started the conversation and I really wanted to see her, so I told her that we should go out or something and her response was always to do something with family. I don't blame her maybe she was right, but in that time I was really stupid so... Yeah. 

The second one was better. In first time in my live I was in LOVE and boi it was a great feeling. But here comes the BUT. After like 3 months I was finally ready to show her up to my family (never brought a girlfriend). I left the polaroid picture of her and me on the table in the living room. My parents were finally so happy, that I have already found somebody. But after 3days after she broke up with me and here comes the most important part. In the first let say week I was like ""yeah we broke up, but everything is ok, we agreed to be friends"" and other stuffs like that. Boi and I want to tell you that this is the worst thing you can do. Let your ex, which you are in love with to be your friend. Anyway from second to fourth week. This was the hardest times for me, coz I realized, that I lost a feeling ""being loved"" by someone else (parents love doesn't count). And in that time I realized, that I have to let her go. I stopped talking to her (in that time she was only replying, so it was one way communication anyway). ""Time will heal everything"" I really do believe that, coz it's true. Time really helped, yes I was sad and everything, but after some time it just went away. 

Now I'm over it and I'm trying to focus on myself the most, I am having so much fun, but in back of my mind there is still this empty space, which I do not know how to get rid of it. I like saying to myself that I am like the ""lone wolf"", who loves to be alone with just myself, but .... I think you already know what I feel. 

This is why I am writing this... Any suggestions how to fill that space without a girl? I mean... I tried with another girls, but it was always just a big mistake and I do not want another ""loss"" in my list or let me put this like this: I am literally scared to see or hear another ""NO"", so I stopped trying.

1390,Apprehensive-Bird799,1600157775,1,"In the grand scheme of life, I know I’m lucky. I have a roof over my head. I eat. Clean water. No healthcare but if there was an emergency, I know an ambulance could be called. 

It’s everything else. I spent six years not being able to leave my home while I helped to take care of a dying parent. A slow, agonizing day to day slog while I watched one of the most intelligent and well-spoken people I’ve ever known slowly decline cognitively and physically. 

Two years after their death I finally found myself in a position where I could strike out on my own. Enter COVID. I know there are so many people around this blue marble suffering and I feel so terrible and guilty. We’re all feeling the effects of isolation. But. The sting of this isolation smarts a bit more. I know how to be alone. It’s a skill and can be learned like any other. I know how to spend extended periods of time in isolation. But. That had a purpose. This is an unseen oppressor. I feel like every bit of meager spirit I have has been ripped from me and I’m suffocating...a thin plastic membrane shrinking and I only notice it when I move too quickly and it snaps me back into a shape I didn’t choose. 

I have an amazing best friend. But I can’t come to them again with the same thing day after day. It’s not fair. I know they’d want me to. But I don’t want to. They work an essential job and I hate the thought of adding to their stress. We care for each other deeply and I know this would weigh on them. 

I have a quarantine partner. But to be honest they’re driving me crazy. A 20 year old who is the stepchild of my sibling...who has no life experience, can’t cook or clean for themselves, with no higher education and no nuance or depth of character. It’s not their fault. They’ve literally never gone out and experienced anything and have had a mother to take care of them up until five months ago when quarantine began. 

I’ve spent nearly six months in a financial and domestic role I didn’t ask for but can’t break out of. My depression has only gotten worse and it’s more and more difficult each day to do the most menial tasks. 

I need near constant intellectual stimulation. But I can only watch so many documentaries, read so many books. Everything is internal. I want so badly to be able to react to another human being and discuss things that aren’t centered around what are we gonna eat today or cool thing you did in your video game. 

I’ve been lonely before. I’ve been alone for years at a time with very little interaction with others but it was always centered around providing care. There’s nothing for me to focus on and throw myself into. 

I’m terrified to leave and have not been past my mailbox since mid March. I am rotting away past the point of stagnation. Some days I feel like I could peel my skin away from my body. I’m a ghost haunting my own home and feel like an intruder in this life even though it’s my own. 

I miss academia. All those years being a caregiver, I had one thing to hold onto. As morbid as it may seem, I knew it wouldn’t be forever. That when this person’s life had run it’s course, I would be free to pursue my own. I could continue with my education. I could fall back into the things that gave me a sense purpose. 

This is a difficult thing to express and I’m grateful for the things I have. The time I had with them before my parent died. I know I should count myself lucky that I’m not in that ever growing statistic of those who’ve perished from this thing. But. I can’t make myself feel anything other than resentment and sadness. And that deep, heavy, dull pain that comes from intense loneliness. A fever pain that radiates and undulates just below the surface.",lonely,Isolation Getting to Me,2020-09-15 18:16:15

I try to make less smart remarks and I've caught myself a few times but it seems like no matter how hard I try it's consistently brought up.

At this rate, I'm surprised they still put up with me and it's no wonder girls seem to dislike me. The thing is they are always yelling and teasing each other and I try to fit in so I open my big mouth and say something dumb or try to poke fun. I tried just speaking when spoken to which they didn't seem to be upset at. They ignore me sometimes so I guess it wasn't a big change considering they've even muted me for a week or two.

I just wonder what I could do better. They put up with me so much and yet I can't take it when they yell at me or get angry with me.

Sometimes I feel I don't belong here anymore and I'm just causing suffering to those around me. If I upset even them, I'm bound to be lonely for the rest of my life anyway, so why even bother.

1397,kathwang12,1600146552,1,"I'm sorry that this is badly written and has bad grammar. I'm not the best writer.

As a kid (in 6th grade) I had a lot of good friends I'd hang out with and have sleepovers with and I had a best friend who I was friends with since kindergarten. I was hyper and outgoing and carefree so I made friends easily. As time passed into late 7th grade, I became socially awkward (ms amirite?). But I became so socially anxious that I was bullied a lot. (Even back in 6th grade but people were still friends with me for some reason)

 I grew up with a narcissistic, a little bit crazy, mother who put into my head (because it was in hers) that everyone was against me if they did anything I thought was mean, even if it really wasn't. She basically reinforced my negative thoughts, turned them around to blame another person, and made them seem real. Just toxic all around. If someone accidentally bumped into us at the store she'd swear up and down that it was on purpose and try to pick fights with strangers, and yell loudly around them that they're assholes/jealous bitches. (This happened everyday) I could go on to give a million examples of her warped perspective. To be clear my mother didn't intentionally isolate me, she honestly believes what she puts in her own head which she projected at me. At a young developing age I adopted this mentality and carried it until mid high school. 

So I naturally started isolating myself from friends and pushing others away. I became unable to be myself around my friends. I became quiet and still around people and not my hyper fun usual self. They eventually got new friends who were fun and we drifted apart when we got to high school. As for my former best friend, I intentionally cut that off because I did not like the person she was becoming/became and I stand by that.

 In freshman year so I was such an anxious/ depressed wreck I feared I would be alone that year and not have any friends. But luckily I went to a magnet school that was full of hipster anxious weirdos so I fell in with the outcasts of that school /program I was in. I still didn't feel like I had friends. I was just on autopilot.

In sophmore-junior year tho, I was completely alone. There were people I sat with at lunch (like a group of 3 to 4 girls) but I was quiet and didn't talk at all. They were not friends, to me. I don't think I even liked them. I just sat there. Sometimes if I couldn't find them I just sat in the bathroom and cried. In senior here, I skipped a lot of classes and didn't interact with anyone. 

My social anxiety doubled from middle school and high school and its only been getting worse. I've been alone since. I feel like I can't connect with people or interact casually with anyone. I used to think I was meant to be a lone wolf and that I was fine with being alone, in fact I preferred it. But I was lying to myself. I've been lonely. And I want friends I can be myself around and hang out with and share interests with. But I just can't seem to form a connection with anyone. It could be my anxiety hindering me. 

I tried hanging out with people and connecting with others at one of my old jobs but Idk how to keep friendships going or how to interact with people. I can't even hang out with small groups of people without having an anxiety attack these days. I really want to make friends but idk how. I'm scared of being judged and hated and boring.

I guess this is just a vent/ asking for advice? Also idk how to tldr 

Tl;Dr:  since middle school, after developing anxiety/ depression, and growing up with a narcissistic mother, i haven't had any friends.

Then as an adolescent and teenager I was a ""latch-key"" kid coming home from school each day alone, hungry, poorly dressed, poor, my mom worked as a waitress during the day and a cocktail waitress at night. I was just the odd kid out. 
Things went well when I got to be a young adult but both marriages were complete failures, for some reason I found myself attracted to abusive, inconsiderate and narcissistic women who were emotionally unavailable. Just like when I was a child I was always trying to get her to love me but I always end up alone again eventually.
Now in my 60s, I feel like my country is decending into distopia. My second wife divorced me for someone with money after mine was spent - I'm afraid for my future - I'm lonely - my mental health is a constant challenge - I cry myself to sleep every night but what seems to hurt the most, whether I am with someone or not, is this existential soul crushing loneliness.

1405,espresso212,1600141364,1," Hi, I hope you all are having a good day!

We started a discord server and are still in the early phase of recruitment so haven't reached full activity yet! So we are eagerly looking forward to recruiting more and turning the place into a close-knitted community.

The idea behind it is to have a place where you can spend your time relaxing in, making new friends from across the world, engage in conversations about anything from music, philosophy, memes. Just a place where you don't feel nameless in a large community :)

We would love to have you join us! The community is rather small right now so you'll not be overwhelmed or won't feel alienated into an already formed community, and would easily be able to fit in :D

Note: Since we have recently started the server, we hope you'll be patient since it might not be active all the time, but we'll be trying our best to not let that happen! Additionally, we ask that you send in some basic information (such as you ASL and anything other important details you may want) This is just to ensure that we keep the server safe and protected :))

Thank you so much for reading, have a good day &lt;3",lonely,17F - New Discord Server for Socializing! [Ages 16-25],2020-09-15 13:42:44
1406,Felipe_1989,1600141074,1,"I'm 31 yo and never really had any lasting friends or gfs. It took me a long time to accept the fact that maybe I'm not that interesting to have around for long (I keep to myself a lot, I get really irritated when someone talks to me while I'm lost in my thoughts or focused on an activity) and I've never really liked being around lots of people for long, unless they are minding their own business that's fine for me (I get tired really soon of house parties and call a cab 2 hours after arriving with whatever bullshit excuse I can come up with, but I love going to dance clubs by myself and have a drink at the bar watching people have fun).

That being said, I get frustrated that after knowing people for so many years, my phone rings only to ask me for stuff, but very rarely to wish me a happy birthday or merry christmas.

I enjoy being by myself, but I find it weird that I at least try to keep in touch with people on social media, only to be met by yes, no or ok responses, or likes. Liking my comment is not a response. I never ask people for shit but they always seem to need something from me, but they don't want anything to do with me immediately afterwards.",lonely,Mixed feelings about loneliness,2020-09-15 13:37:54

The dreams where I’m not judged for who I am. The kind where I have all my friends with me, in our happy little circle. One where I meet my perfect woman by chance and she joins our group right away, having a blast, and she has no reservations about being with me just because we’re both women. One where we quickly fall deeply, indescribably, from the bottom of our hearts, in love. The kind of love and vulnerability that I crave so deeply. Nothing matters except us and getting lost in each other. We were just about to move in together and introduce our pets to each other when I woke up. 

I woke up hugging my squishy cat pillow, alone, while my real cat screamed for her breakfast and I was suddenly so sad in my little house by the forest where my sink doesn’t work and I had worked so hard to get, and I almost never have anyone over because my friend count is so low. I see them maybe two or three times a year even without Covid. I never have a partner over, because it’s so hard to meet anyone, even with the covid factor. 

I’m just suddenly so reminded that not even three days ago the girl I couldn’t stop thinking about told me that I wasn’t a good fit for her, how I was fun but not enough. I’m always a fun toy, but never enough for someone else. 

I just want to be held by a girl who accepts me as I am and sees me more as just the goofy fun girl that’ll take her drinking and keep her laughing for hours, I want the girl that doesn’t pass the time with me while they find something more real.

I got no one
I'm always by myself got no one to love
That's how it's always been
All by myself in my room
Listenig to music tryna cope
Wanting to die but wanting to see what's gonna happen
I'm not ready to go
I'm just tired of living
I need a reason to be here
A reason to be alive
I want someone to love me and that someone to love me back
I'm tryna stay happy but it's hard when no one cares for you
It's hard when your best friend is the bloody knife in your hand
It's hard when you're surrounded by people while still feeling like you're alone
I got no best friend
I'm always the second option
It doesn't matter if I'm there or not
I don't have anyone in my life to make me happy
I want that special person
I want to give them the world
They deserve to be happy
They deserve to feel loved
And I wanna give it all to them for loving me
Cuz that's all I really want
To feel enough
To feel cared
To feel loved
I feel so worthless
I just wanna cry
But I can't
I'm too numb 
I'm too sad
I'm too lonely
I just wanna feel alive and have someone to love me before I die the same way I love them
Just someone to check up on me and cuddle
Someone to hug me when I'm sad
Someone to understand what I'm going through
Someone to not compare me to others we aren't the same
I'm not normal
Stop acting like I am
I'm broken while never been in love
Never had a girl and will never have one
I hate myself too much
Everything about me
My face, my body, my mind, my life 
I hate every bit of it
I got no reason to be sad
Got nothing in my life to fix
Yet here I am with tears in my eyes
Just waiting for time to pass
It's 2 am and I'm not sleeping
Last time I ate was yesterday morning
I don't feel hunger I don't wanna eat 
I'm fat I can't sleep
I'd rather overthink my whole life and find reasons for myself to never be loved
Cuz that's all I really want
I just wanna be loved

1428,115random,1600128739,1,"In middle school I kind of fell backwards into a group of friends. Someone I talked to in class invited me to sit at his table during lunch and I insanely had a group of friends. That might be the closest group I've ever had, we still talk and my best friend to this day was from that table. My middle school is also a high school - I stayed there freshman year then switched to a different school the next. My best friend was at that school so I just fell right into his friend group and it was pretty great. By junior and senior year the group split in two and I ended up getting left out of everything that didn't happen at the lunch table. Around that time, my dad and step mom got a divorce and my dad and I lived together in a new place. He'd spend a lot of time at work and with friends, which just added to the sinking loneliness. 

I'm in college now and have made a handful of friends but only a couple I was close with. One moved back to England and the other passed away. My best friend moved  a timezone away so I don't really get to see much of him anymore either. There's one guy I spend time with but I don't think we have much of a connection - just some common interests that gives us an excuse to go places together. That connection seems to be the hardest thing to find. I've joined clubs, even started a club, to try and find people I connect to. I've been with my girlfriend for 2+ years and I feel like I still don't have that connection with her. Even with other people I still feel alone, I feel *unseen*. 

Some media and entertainment has helped. The fact that it's hard to find stuff that I can relate to is even more isolating. There is no shortage of media that is focused on loneliness so the fact that so little feels relatable make my experience feel even more unique. I know it's not unique but my feels won't listen to me. That's where I'm at, it comes and goes though. There's a good chance I won't mind at all tomorrow and find something new to do.  

\----

I only included the low points of my life since it's about being lonely so I'm sure this paints a much worse picture than it really is. I'm actually doing fine, this feeling just has been coming more apparent recently. Pre-covid I was dealing with the same thing but it's just exaggerated it. Writing is just a great outlet for me so I thought I would share. I suppose there is no real purpose for this post other than that.

I know that not everything revolves around me and I need to contribute my part in life. This isn’t about that. I just need my voice to be heard and any guidance of use bestowed upon me. 

Ever since I joined this new secondary school of mine I’ve been blacklisted. Most people my age love to have someone to hate, many of whom hold that desire close as they grow up. The point is, I was the unlucky one that was weak enough for them to target, and so I’m powerless. It doesn’t matter what I say or do. Wether I’m mean or nice, boring or funny, enjoyable or irritating, etc. I’m not allowed to be recognised until they give me permission. 

The problem is that I thought I could handle it. I clung onto the hope that maybe there was something I could do to change things around, and make something of myself from their point of view. But now stuff that I’m not inclined to share right now has been happening at home, which was my one safe space. And now I have nowhere to go other than the space inside my head. And if you didn’t know already that does wonders for your mental health. 

I can’t hide away in lessons because of the pressure of my responsibilities. I can’t hide away in social time because people just can’t stop reminding me of how isolated and alone I truly am on the inside. It’s like a domino effect. All of these things simultaneously help each other become more impactful, and more daunting in my life. It’s taking away all of my hope and motivation and all I need from them is to just listen to me and let me have my voice back. 

The worst part is that it’s making me bitter. It’s making me a much more jealous and hateful person in my head. All it takes is one negative thought in my day and my internal goes down into a spiral, until I’m left desperate to take it all out on someone, or maybe even myself. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how many times I can reach out on Reddit until I’ve overstated my welcome.

1444,Bonez_1999,1600116757,1,"Hello,

I’ve decided I need to justify the rationale behind my actions.

My life has been pain from the age of 14 up till present day.

I was molested when I was a young teen. I’ve been abandoned by my whole family. I’ve been homeless. I’ve been broke and nothing is improving. I’m just a broken, miserable shell of a human being. Being molested has defined me as a person and shaped me as a human being.
 
I’m 21 and I live alone. I suffer from PTSD and anorexia from my very abusive childhood where I wasn’t being fed properly and couldn’t even go to the bathroom in peace.

I lost my job in March and have been unemployed since then. I’m slowing losing everything and will even lose my apartment as I’ve been served with an eviction letter. I can no longer afford food nor electricity and I cannot continue as I have nothing left in the tank.

I’ve been strong for years and years and I can’t anymore.",lonely,I can’t be helped.,2020-09-15 06:52:37

It's so painful that we are close friends, because i can't just ignore her. She is my friend and she doesn't know that i am interested in her. She has a boyfriend btw and i don't have any chances. I feel like i am alone in this world and no one cares about me. When i do something really good they just envy and toxic. I feel so bad when i see a dream about my crush or my friend call me, i just feel empty and want to tell her my feelings about this. She will just laugh like an angel she can't relate to my feelings. I m so shy and have 0 confidence. I live with this almost 5 years already and i know this is really bad. I need to focus on something else but can't. Everything is just against me.

1450,WasteVideo,1600113331,1,"I destroyed the foundation of my happiness by loving someone (who didn’t love me as much) more than myself. I was too young to really know what I was doin but my first “girlfriend” was when I was in 8th &amp; 9th grade. We were dating for a year and a half. Though we were only 15 and 16, she had more WAYY more experienced than me. This didn’t bother me back then and sum like that still wouldn’t bother me today. However, she always threw my lack of experience in my face and made me feel bad about it (wether she meant to or not). We told each other that we loved each other often and I was sooo happy. She said it first and I was GEEKIN 😂 if you saw my reaction, some would say “aww” and others would make fun of me. I was the really shy, chill dude and she was the outgoing, energetic girl. 


It’s hard to say when it started but she started to consistently make me feel bad about myself but would cover it up by saying that she was joking. This would make me feel like I was too sensitive and need to toughen up. She had to move to a different state over summer break of 9th grade but we tried long distance. It turned out that she sent my classmates naked pictures and videos via Snapchat and texting. I didn’t know cuz I didn’t have ANY social media at the time and nobody told me. While all this was happening under my nose, I was sooo in love with her. I always wanted to do nothing more than make her feel good about herself, comfort and care for her, etc. It ended over text after she told me how unhappy she was, told me that she was either gonna kill herself, or wanted to ( I can’t remember). Then she dumped me...over text
[ 😂 can’t lie, when I read this out loud, it’s kinda funny]



I think by trying to gain the attention, love and affection of someone who cared for me less than I cared for her, I lost my own self respect; while losing my own self respect, I lost love for myself. When people in school started making fun of me for dating her and made fun of me for goin out bad (like I did), I started to hate myself for being in that situation. Before I dated her, I preferred to be by myself cuz I never enjoyed anyone’s company, nowadays I isolate myself because I don’t feel that I’m good enough for anyone’s company and I’m convinced that no girl would want anything to do with me. BUT, I don’t place the blame for my feelings about myself on nobody but myself. I feel like I’m the reason I’m this way.

1453,TheLonelySnowboard,1600111553,1,"Covid-19 has been absolutely abysmal for me. For one, the patients who keep coming into the hospital don't seem to end regardless of what regulations are put into place, followed or ignored. Work has become so depressing. I really feel for the families that are being ripped apart because of this virus. And I despise those who continue to ignore the science and don't care that their actions result in more lives lost and more time spent fighting Covid. 

Because of the virus, I have limited myself from doing anything interesting this year because that's the safe thing to do. I work in the hospital - I am at risk. But I haven't seen any of the few friends I have in months. I hardly go home to see my family anymore. I don't have anyone I hang out with from work; they are all just acquaintances. I want to go out and meet new people and try and make new friends in this new area that I moved to, but I can't because of the virus. I feel trapped. 

Life for the past 9 months has been nothing short of depressing. I do the same thing everyday - if I'm not working my nights, I'm sleeping until noon and staying in my apartment alone. Working out is the only way I am keeping myself sane. I'm having more suicidal thoughts than ever. I have no one I can safely talk to to vent.

1459,Nixxxxie,1600108948,1,"First off, theres no age restriction on loneliness. We are all entitled to our valid emotions no matter if you're 16 or 60. With that being said, lately I find myself cultivating feelings of bitterness towards all the young people who say things like ""Im going to be alone forever."" Im generally a pretty empathetic person so it bothers me to the extreme that these feelings are becoming more and more present with each passing year. I never want to be the kind of person who invalidates someones feelings for any reason, let alone their age. Still, I cant help but feel like its increasingly difficult for me to find someone I can relate to. Its not that I dont appreciate all the uplifting sentiments from the younger lonley-hearts that are sure to follow, its just that a lot of these well intentioned sentiments feel like they dont apply to me. It feels like maybe Im to old for them.
Ive never been sought after by men. I didnt lose my virginity untill I was 18 and I did it in a very wrong way for very wrong reasons. My first real relationship didnt occur until I was 21 and 2 months into it I became pregnant. What followed was a tumultuous, on/off relationship with many hardships and heartaches. There were issues with addiction, infidelity, abuse and, of course, financial strain. Every mistake that was made, every scar that formed, I forgave without a second thought. Desperate to give my son the loving 2 parent home I never had and maybe even more desperate to hold on to what I believed to be my only chance at a happily ever after. I wont go into to much detail but to put some perspective on things, my sons father has stolen all the money from our bank account and disappeared without a trace on 3 seperate occasions. Each time it left my son and I homeless. One time it was a literal life and death sitiation. Everytime I had to pull us out of the gutter and restart my life from less than zero amd everytime I allowed him, without hesitation, to come back home and do it all over again. The last time he abandon us really was the **last** time. He didnt try to come back and I didnt chase after him. There were a couple of guys that I ""dated"" in between our break-ups but none of them ever wanted to be in an actual relationship with me and Ive never been the kinda girl who is comfortable with casual sex so I kept running back to my only option until I realized the pain of being with him was far greater than the pain of being alone. At the time, I truly believed there had to be something better for me out there. Someone better. Years passed and I learned how to love myself in ways I never thought possible. I was ok with being alone. I even enjoyed it. I have not had another relationship, a single date, or even a mild flirtation with anyone else since our final break up. Ive been ready to date for a while but even now, after all these years, I still cant find anyone who wants to date me. Im not ugly by any definition of the word. I am overweight (more-so since the pandemic started) but I dont feel unattractive. Plain maybe, but not unattractive. Last month I turned 39. My son, now 16, is only a couple short years away from leaving to start his adult life and for the first time I will be truly alone. I feel this overwhelming sense of urgency. Like the unattractivness I dont quite feel is slowly creeping in and stealing the last bits of what make me even somewhat desireable. As stupid as this sounds, it feels like time is running out. I know there isnt a point of no return for finding love but it doesnt make the feeling any less prevalent. I no longer remember what its like to feel desired. To be looked at with a certain hunger. To be pursued by a man. And Im afraid I never will again. I dont want to be alone any more but I also dont know how to meet and attract men my own age (or any age for that matter). And Im drowning in a sea of 20-somethings who will say they relate when they absolutely cant. What I wouldnt give to be a 20-something knowing what I know now and loving myself the way I never did then. What I wouldnt give to have the power of my beautiful youth behind me as I navigate this new uncharted territory.

1494,EffectiveLow900,1600076370,2,"Venting...

Life is feeling very...difficult. I feel lonely. It's been a year since I've seen anyone other than members
of my immediate family. I'm finally getting a diploma, it took some time. I was eager to start to work, and 
I'll admit I was a bit naive, thinking finding a job would not be too much of a hassle. Well I was wrong,
I'm not even going to mention the pandemic, I feel like an idiot.

I feel like there's something wrong with me, something that everyone can see, it's written on my face. But
I don't see it, I just see the consequences. I'm unable to form and maintain relationships. I don't speak to 
the people I used to feel close to and I'm afraid of reaching out. I wouldn't know what to say. 

As long as I interacted with people on a daily basis things were different. There usually was a group of 
people I'd hang out with, it certainly felt like friendship. Thing is I'm not comfortable with other methods
of communicating that rely exclusively on ones ability to write. I don't know why it feels so hard. When 
you interact with someone face to face you have a direct feedback that makes things so much easier. I don't 
know how to have a conversation with someone when the conversation has been fragmented. I loose context, I
rewrite one line answers ten times and end up not sending, or I forget. As such I don't keep in touch with
people from my past, but I miss them, I miss them a lot.

Once upon a time I had a girlfriend. She was beautiful and kind, I was insecure and an asshole and it ended.
I feel like this was a one time deal that I f***** up, never to be repeated. Part of me certainly feels that
I deserve to be alone and should accept it, but I can't. I should accept that I'm a crap friend, a crap
boyfriend and probably would be a crap father, I don't think so. I'm not at that stage ... yet. Another part 
still believes that I have something to offer, somewhere there must be a place where I can be happy, no ?

Up and down, up and down, up and down the feelings go. Maybe one of these days I'll wake up and I won't be so
scared anymore. Today I feel out of place, like I'd make a better animal then a human being. What I'd give
right now to put thinking aside and live of pure instinct. Fear for my life, now that gives meaning to a life.
Well I can't shut my brain off so have to deal with things as is. For my next life I'll ask to be a frog.

done.",lonely,Weak and ashamed,2020-09-14 19:39:30
1495,keblash,1600076319,2,"God damnit im so fucking lonely! I haven't hung out with anyone in weeks outside my immediate family. Ive hardly even talked to any of my old friends in that time either. I don't know what to do, ive felt this way for years now and I still can't find a way to make it any better. 

I are up in a family of big families. My mom and dad each had 7 siblings and all of them had 5-8 kids of their own, we had to have two thanksgivings, one with each side of the family because there were so many people. my family had 10 people. I was the oldest with 7 siblings. I had 5-6 friends from the time I was a baby that I saw all the time and hung out with almost constantly. Basically I was almost ALWAYS around people with things going on and something to do. Ive now lived alone for the past almost 3 years and have never been able to really adjust. at first it was nice to have some quite and my own space, but now im just sad and bored and alone 99% of the time doing nothing productive.

A couple years ago I had a friend group of 10+ people who I was great friends with that hung out almost every night and did shit and went places all the time and had fun. I was happy then. Shit happened, as it does, and the group has been totally destroyed for years now and most of the people don't talk to any of the old members at all any more. All I have left is 3 core guy friends I've had since I was a baby but one works long hours and has a wife and 5 kids, one works 70+ hours a week regularly with AMR and spend 90% of the rest of his time with his band or traveling with his GF, the other is a teacher and has an opposite work schedule to me yet I still see him the most by far...like 4-5 hours once a month or so... Two of the guys have been on bad terms for a coupe months so the most I've had is hanging with two of them for a couple hours every couple of Friday nights. 

I live in a smallish town that doesn't have many places to go to just hang or to do fun things, our bowling alleys have shut down recently anyway and the only other things we have are mainly restaurants, and I work swing shift so I cant go anywhere when anyone will be out anyways most the time anyway.

When I got my new job and hoped that maybe I could make friends there but most of the people are much older then me, like in their fifties (I'm 27 M btw), and half of them or old naggy Karen type women. Its at a community college so I thought I might be able to meet some of the teachers or staff and find friends there but since the pandemic 95% of the staff works from home.

Now, I do see my family a fair amount in comparison, but half of my siblings don't live at home anymore and have relationships/marriages of their own to worry about so seeing more then 2-3 of them at a time is more uncommon.

my typical week looks like this: 

Monday-Friday: wake up-get ready for work-work till 11pm-go to the gym-go home and watch Netflix/play xbox till 5am-crash-repeat.

Sat/Sun: wake up between 1pm and 5pm-maybe visit parent and dick around at their house for a few hours-go home-watch Netflix/play xbox for a while-get groceries-crash around 5am.

When the pandemic hit my routine didn't even change, like at all (I have a garage gym so I was able to keep working out). I never went anywhere or saw anyone anyway so its like nothing changed but the fact that even if I knew what to do or how to meet people or had social skills I couldn't really do anything about it right now anyway makes me feel 1000% worse. For fucks sake I just want to be around people I like again, is that too god damn much to ask for?

&amp;#x200B;

This turned into more of a rant the I was planning on... I dunno, I just needed someone to talk to and I couldn't think of anyone else besides you guys here, so, if you got this far thanks for taking the time, I really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: grew up with lots of people/lots of friends always around, friend group collapsed in recent years, I started living alone, nobody to talk to or hang out with anymore and nothing to do in my smallish town. I spend 95-99% of my time at home alone sitting in my room doing nothing productive and I cant continue this for the rest of my life but ran out of motivation and ideas to fix anything a long time ago.",lonely,I won't survive if I have to continue being this lonely,2020-09-14 19:38:39

1523,leftygibsonmarauder,1600056683,1,"Maybe older than most here and I hope you younger redditors make it through these lonely periods before hitting my age...but I feel like I've never been anything but lonely. As a child I was bullied by my older sibling in extreme ways, latchkey parents with their own issues, was always the odd one in school though because I wasn't a jerk I think most liked me well enough, still never connected with anyone -or- if I did, they would end up moving away, out of state. I sought out attention and found it in several relationships where I was gaslit and lied to, leaving me with absolutely no self-confidence whatsoever. It took me two years to start to recover mentally from my last relationship, which was awful. Then the quarantine happened, removing any chance of finding a friendship in real life. I tried making friends online, various apps and online communities, but I really just suck at this. I started to go down the road of ""adult"" reddit or whatever, but even that didn't seem to be for me. 

I have a job, and luckily I see people at work everyday. But, I take care of disabled people and the person I spend almost everyday with, doesn't speak (but he types and uses Reddit so he might see this, hey dude!). So I usually talk his ears off because after I leave him, I spend 15 hours in total solitude. It's not like I can meet people in real life, and even before COVID I wasn't knocking it out of the park in that regard. 

I tried to remember the last time I was truly happy for an extended period, and I think I was 5 years old, 33 years ago now. At a certain point you just start to think that it must be that you're broken, because other people seem to find happiness in a partner or group of friends. I just really don't know what to do. I have tried having serious attitude changes, hobbies, etc., but I really just think I am destined to be lonely throughout my entire life or there is something wrong with my biochemical makeup. 

I see other people living life and enjoying themselves, but I always feel outside of that. I would love to just have someone here at the end of the day to ask me how work was and share some conversation about anything and nothing. I don't know if anyone would have any advice, thanks for allowing me to rant, r/lonely. I'm trying to keep my head above water here and I hope everyone else can too.

The two of them spent the whole day talking to each other and sharing a bunch of inside jokes that I didn’t understand. I felt like a ghost and like if I wasn’t there they wouldn’t even notice.

The year after that, I invited 3 people who I was friends with, I guess, to my house. One of them actually left early and the actually told me later it was because they actually did not want to be there.

1550,nobodyimportant93,1600039050,1,"Life is so damn confusing. It feels like a massive machine that's just slowly maneuvering itself through the world. Any attempt to change the controls or adjust your path takes so much effort, and takes so long to work its way through the gears and the bells and the whistles on down to where the rubber meets the road. And worst of all is when you confidently pull a lever, expecting to see results, even years down the line, only to realize that it was disconnected, leading nowhere, doing nothing. You find yourself second guessing, misremembering, and trying to figure out what to do now that you didn't end up where you hoped.

I've slowly started to shift back on track. I've gotten things moving in the right direction. I finally got a job again. I've got medicine to help me out. I'm still surviving and not dying.

Why is everything built to be so meaningless to those who find themselves without friends at the end of the day, or without lovers at the end of the night? 

I know I'm broken, or weird, or different. I know that you're supposed to be happy and content with yourself before looking for others. I know its unfair to someone else to put your hopes and dreams in them. But as I sit here on my days off and realize that I can't stand who I am, I don't know where the rest of myself is. Where's the part of me I can see in the mirror and like? Where's the part of me I can be proud of for staying alive? Where's the engaging and interesting pieces that draw me forward and keep me engaged? Where's someone to love?

It's obvious to me why I haven't found anyone. I'm not currently anyone to be found. But I don't know how to change that, or how to process it. I'm not worth it, even when everyone else is. And it just makes me feel lonely, because at the end of the day, I don't even have myself here to rely on. I'm just a shell of a person looking to be filled with something or someone worthwhile.

Hey guys, today I wanted to share something w yall.

Lately, ive been feeling overwhelmed w loneliness. I never used to feel this way. I was mostluy enough for myself, and neither is this feeling unusual but its been recurring quite a lot lately. 

I see someone happy , someone whose been blessed w something new, someone living a good life, it makes me sad. I feel bad for myself. Since the past 4 yrs everything has been a mes for me. I absolutely have no friends. I used to talk to a couple of guys online and now even that’s gone. I go on chat sites to drive away this feeling only to run away from horny freaks. I just don’t know whats wrong w melately. I feel as tho people whom I thought were my friends aren’t. I had one close cousin w whom I used to be friends but now that shes married,I cant just ring her up anytime, besides, it feels as tho now she cant relate to me anymore. A few months back I told her about all the bad things my dad called me and she didn’t even msg back, she was like ‘what can I say….’ . I stepped on my pride and displayed myself as pathetic opening the doors to my miserable personal life (which I rarely do) while writing all the things my dad called me and she was clueless. Im the one always calling her, messaging her, when I complain she says she will but never does.

I also have 2 other twin cousins I used to be close w but they only want to dig up info about my family and then bitch about us. We used to have such a beautiful and wholesome relationship as kids but when I learnt that they only used my friendship as means of digging up info about my family, I was heart broken. 

Im not interested in relationships. I don’t know if I want friends, maybe I do. Yes I do. But right now, right now this feeling of loneliness and anger whenever I see someone who seems to be happy is really troubling. I cant bring myself to feel happy for someone. I don’t spit hate at them but im not happy for them, I feel envious. And its just growing. I want to truly feel happy seeing others happy but its just making me sad, and more sad. And this is making me feel monstrous and pathetic. I feel disgusted by myself and I also feel really sad. Seeing someone enjoying makes me cry over myself. Its happened about thrice till now. Im just lost. I cant figure out what these new emotions im going through are.",lonely,Just a bunch of genuinely mixed up feelings ive been experiencing as i pass through the current stage of my life.,2020-09-14 08:48:07

I keep falling.. I used to think that I had it all figured out, but there's always something that proves me otherwise. I told myself that I am strong enough to go solo in life, but f@ck who am I kidding? I miss my friends now more than ever. I lost contact with my friends back in 2016, 
because I dropped out of school due to depression and pretty much deleted all my social media. For the longest time I tried to numb the pain away. I tried to keep myself busy watching movies, playing video games, masturbate etc. But now even these things don't work for me. Well they work, but only temporary. And the hardest part is that I have actually made attempts to better myself in these past 3-4 years, I've tried to understand my depression and self isolation, but I have more questions than answers. Right now I'm realising that honestly I don't know sh@t. I have absolutely nothing figured out. I tell myself that it's okay and that I can embrace the loneliness and turn it into peace of solitude, but holy moly I think I am just straight up lying to myself. I wanna believe I can do it, I get motivated and even hopeful at times, but there's always these days such as now, where I fall even deeper. And the more I fall, the less I recognise myself. I went from having friends and somewhat of a social life to a asocial and an outcast. I became full of hatred and I'm only 21 years old. I just don't know what kind of a future there is for a guy like me. One thing that depression did to me is that I started to question everything. It's almost as if you can see through the lies of society, but you still have to put on your fake mask and pretend like everything is okay. Anyway that's another topic entirely. Anyway, looks like you've reached the end of this long rant. Thanks for your time!

Then I started to think that I was the problem, I should change but it was too hard for me and I just didn't want to. So I blamed myself for being the way I am.

But now, I've realized that none is to be blamed. The world is different from me, that's true. But it doesn't mean one of them has to change, or should have been different from the beginning. So now I just tell myself that I just don't ""fit"" to this world.

Some will say that there are other people in my situation, so I'm not alone, but then it just means that we don't fit to this world. And when i talk about the ""world"" I'm obviously talking about the majority of people and what society usually glorifies.

1592,wanttodoewantotdie,1600008202,8,"i know half of the world population can probably relate to that statement but i’m 19 and since i was 16 my depression has slowly become a bigger and bigger part of who i am as a person. a little over a year ago i broke up with my girlfriend of almost 3 years. no one prepared me for how it felt. i thought the first girlfriend was supposed to just be dumb love that you grow from if it doesn’t work. i’ve grown from loving her, but so much about her makes me depressed and sad to this day. we started dating when she was in 9th grade and i was in 10th and we broke up shortly after i graduated high school, so she was such a huge part of my high school experience. everything was about her. that’s how i thought relationships were. if they weren’t happy it was your spot as their lover to help them. she had lots of fucked up shit going on in her head, pretty much stemming from her shitty childhood (dad beating her and mom, everyone in her family being somehow abusive, me being the first person in her whole life to show genuine love and affection to her) but my young 16 year old brain didn’t know that. i blamed it on myself and long story short i let her being suicidal make me suicidal and i would take it back out on her (not on purpose literally in fits of panic and anger and emotion that i never had experienced before then) now that we aren’t dating we’re still friends because we both virtually have no one and if we were to stop talking, that wouldn’t really help muxh. i’m currently so alone, i have people who say they’re here for me if i need them but when i start emotionally exposing myself to anyone they aren’t ready for it or some bullshit and i just end up feeling like i shouldn’t have reached out in the first place. i cant talk to my ex about anything emotional because it ends bad every time we so much as speak. everything sucks and nothing will ever be perfect and that depresses the fuck out of me and i grew out of being suicidal probably like around a year ago but the thoughts and urges are coming back and now i don’t have someone close enough to stop me or reassure me to go to to just cry. i’m aware that i’m currently just having another depressive episode, but like i said at the beginning my depression and anxiety have become genuine issues for me. i currently am kinda dependent on weed so i can do things like sleep and not feel empty and sad while out with people. i want to start the process of getting medicated but my ex told me that when she was getting medicated like half a year ago they drug tested her, so i’m gonna have to go clean in order to even try the medication which i understand but i just don’t know if i can handle being as depressed and alone as i know i will be without it constantly. i sometimes force myself to just be sad and not just get high to get rid of the sadness, because i know that won’t help anything. but it will be constant all the time depression and emptiness and cold and nothing with no breaks to sleep or chill and play video games or anything. this wouldn’t be such an issue for me if i didn’t feel so alone. idk if that can even make me happy in my current point in life so i guess i’m just gonna have to do it and deal with the mental pain and exhaustion. ugh

1602,-Living-Dead-Girl-,1600000190,2,"a month or two ago i fell out with the only real friend I've ever had. it was pretty serious, blocked eachother and didnt look like we would ever speak again. i was pretty upset about it, especially due to having literally no one else i ever spoke to or met with. she was literally my only social life. 

so I've been really lonely and extremely depressed due to being unable to connect with people. I'm autistic in a way that makes social things seem like a confusing alien language. 

there was an incident where i happened to run into an old kinda friend from high school, who doesn't really respond to messages and doesnt seem to have much interest in hanging out. i sat with her for a bit and she seemed to enjoy talking with me (from what i could tell anyway) but she sort of clammed up when i would attemp to suggest maybe coming along with her to social things and anything that involved me being invloved with her and her friends in general. her boyfriend was being quite nice to me but i think maybe my loneliness and desperation were just as clear as this girls complete non interest in having anything to do with me, and he felt sorry for me. the interaction ended with her and her boyfriend going to meet friends and me being told i should get home.

so, today, my only friend, the one i fell out with, she turned up at my door. i was extremely happy at first. thought she was there to apologise, or to ask if we could forget about it and just be friends still. but no. she's moving away for university. she leaves in a few days. its far away. she wanted to say goodbye. i find it difficult to express emotions to or in front of people. i didnt show anything. i awkwardly laughed, said ""cool aha"", stuff like that. she handed me a letter. she left. the letter says how much she loves me and wont forget me. 

now im just sat here in my flat, alone. sobbing. 

all of this is piling onto an already disastrous situation. unhelped mental illness, an incredibly unstable and turbulent relationship (who is now literally the only person i have in my life), possibility of losing the place i live, unstable and uncertain income, all of this causing a deep depression and making unchecked mental illnesses worsen, on top of autism and anxiety which prevents me from doing a lot of things most people can do. and now, i am literally alone. not a single friend in the world. i have no one.

1610,AlaskaRom13,1599990321,5,"I have a lot of trauma, I grew up in and out of foster homes, I was molested by “family friends” when I was seven and that went on for two years. Ever since then I’ve been incredibly hyper sexual. I started masterbating when I was seven, I think as a result of being exposed to sexual behavior at such a young age. I was molested by a woman, and I am a woman and I think that caused my bisexuality. I think you can have any sexual orientation without having to undergo some traumatic experience, but I think my own experience is why I’ve always been so open to being intimate with my own gender. 

Basically, I’ve been addicted to masterbating since I was seven. It was the only thing that really gave me any relief. It was always pretty bad, I could do it 3-6 times a day, I’ve always had a hard time concentrating in school because I was always thinking about sex all throughout middle school and high school. I had sex for the first time when I was 14, but started doing sexual things with people long before that. 

When I turned fifteen I got really into drugs. Nothing too insane, I just liked to drink a lot and smoke pot and cigarettes. One night my friend asked if I wanted to try Xanax and so I did and I ended up getting raped by 3 boys from my school because the Xanax was so disorienting. After it happened, I was really numb and I didn’t really feel anything about it, I thought I was completely unaffected but I think my behavior afterwards implies otherwise. I became very promiscuous. My addiction to masterbation became so much worse. I had sex with so many different people. I had a boyfriend who I cheated on multiple times because I was also addicted to sex. It didn’t matter who I was with, I would always cheat on them. I  was sixteen when I started having sex with a 22 year old. When I would have sex with people, I let them do whatever they wanted, if they wanted to hit me or hurt me or choke me I would let them. I was into that kind of thing or at least I thought I was but in actuality it made me very uncomfortable. 

After the 22 year old, I decided that I was done being so reckless with my body. I started dating a really nice guy and I left behind the me who liked doing drugs and drinking every night, and who had sex with strangers. The guy I was dating knew I had a lot of trauma and he just wanted to be there for me. We ended up dating for two years and during those two years I became really close with his family and for once I felt like I had people to rely on. There were so many beautiful memories packed into those two years of my life and for once I felt safe. But something happened in me, I’m not sure what caused me to leave it, boredom maybe? I think I’m just addicted to chaos to be honest. So I cheated on my boyfriend and left him and started being promiscuous again. 

I’m nineteen years old now and I would say that my life is okay. I live with a friend and her mom and they really love me. I’m at a community college. I have a job. I’ve picked up good hobbies. But I’ve never felt more alone than ever. I still sleep with strangers. But I’ve come to realize that the reason I do it is because I’m hoping that one day one of those strangers will love me. But they never do. This past year has been hell, I’ve put myself out there with so many different men and women and no one ever stays or cares about me. They all have one goal and it’s just sex, and I understand I put myself out there for sex but I really just want love. I just want someone to touch me and hold me and care about me but it’s all just mindless sex for them. I just want them to stay with me. No one stays and no one cares. They don’t even care to get to know me and it feels like I dug myself into a hole that I’m incapable of climbing out of. I am so lonely all of the time. I was addicted to masterbating but recently, after the last stranger I had sex with, I haven’t been able to touch myself anymore because every time I masterbate now I feel even more alone. I always end up sobbing afterwards because I realize how completely alone I am and how I just want someone to be there. The reason I bring the masterbating up is because it’s kind of a big deal that I can’t even do my own addiction anymore because I feel the weight of my loneliness so much more after it. 

The reason why I’m coming here with this is because I don’t want to feel like this anymore and I guess I just want someone’s advice or encouragement to keep on going despite the loneliness. Sometimes it feels so unbearable, I feel like the most unloveable person in the world. Does anyone ever feel like this or am I completely alone in my loneliness.",lonely,Please read this.

Its hard to pin down, I've just always felt so sad and stuck in the mud when I'm by myself. The few friends I have in real life don't really do much with me or talk to me and it feels a little crappy. My online friends are usually around to talk more, relatively, but it still just itches me in the back of my head that I'm not likeable enough for them to actively want to do anything. In a large majority of conversations, I am always the one to initiate. Do my friends not like me enough to want to talk to me unless I decide to talk to them first? It just always sets my days off on the wrong foot when I wake up to no notifications from anywhere. I always feel so conflicted and torn in half mentally. One half of me desperately hates myself and thinks that I'm a big baby and the other wants to believe that its ok to feel this way and agrees that maybe I do deserve a little more. Like I've had a good middle class life, never gotten in trouble in any way, never hurt anybody, did good in general and haven't got treated bad in any way. But that's the thing. I've never been treated horribly but I've also never been treated nicely or legitimately complimented and I feel like such a sucker hungry for attention but honestly I just want more friends. More people I can spend my time with. I feel super clingy towards everyone im friends with and it kills me honestly. I'm just tired of being like some npc in a game or a ghost that no one seems to see or interact with.

I feel so alone and like no one actually likes to listen, but I feel I have no good way to express this without feeling like I'm being annoying or coming off as desperate and clingy. I just want some one or multiple people even in general I can feel really understands me and people who I can dedicate to and get the same loyalty and dedication back. But thats too much to ask, right? I guess ill stop here because I could go on forever rambling this stuff but honestly and whole heartedly if you have made it this far i greatly appreciate it and even if you don't comment or leave a thumbs up or whatever I hope that you are having a nice day/night.

To start things off, I’ll give you a little bit of background information and how it’s changed and led to this.

First off I am somebody who suffers from Mental health pretty badly. I have extreme social anxiety, and more than likely depression at this point, and it makes for a hard time talking and meeting new people. So if you have any idea what it’s like dealing with mental health and all the problems that come along with it, than I’m glad you can relate or understand. 

So I have or (had) a best friend, I am a male she’s a female. We live together, we’ve known each other for about 7 years, but really grew close through mutual connections in a previous living arrangement in a different city. At that time I was dating her (at the time) bestfriends sister, and we all lived together, so there was 4 of us in total me, my gf, my (?), my ?’s best friend. My ex, was cheating on me. And my ex’s sister was pulling some really shady shit behind my now friends back, which I didn’t agree with and didn’t think was right. So we grew close dealing with our own problems and became bestfriends. They kicked her out, and between that she lost a best friend of 10 years. 
Not long after, I moved back to my home city and offered to try a new living situation together since we were so close and knew we could actually live together. (When they kicked her out, she moved back home (a really small town, with nothing to offer in the middle of nowhere basically)). So I was trying to be a good friend and help her out if I could. 

Fast forward a few months, we finally got a house together with my brother and his girlfriend as well. We’ve lived together for about 1 1/2 years now.
In the beginning when she moved here, we got close again, even closer physically. 
We ended up having sex more times than I can remember, but it really didn’t become just about that, it was more of it just happened here and there. It was the closeness, the cuddling and all the little harmless physical interactions. 
Forget about the sex, all those other little things are the things that helped me feel like I had someone genuinely really close to me.
I’ll touch back on this after.

Recently a few months ago, she mentioned this person at work and long story short it was a flirty relationship that was developing. Over the past few months, she’s been pulling herself away physically from me. 
And it hurts.
I would wake up everyday wondering and guessing if today would be the day I have my best friend back. 
She hasn’t been to his place very much, but I know it’s just like a fuck Buddy type deal. 
Over this time, I’ve been effected emotionally not knowing what’s going on, or if I’m the problem. 
Remember, we live together so I had to watch this happen day by day in front of my face. 
I lashed out and said a few things to her that were pretty hurtful everytime she’d go to this guys place, or we got into an argument (which we’ve been doing a lot lately).

We’ve recently just talked about all this, and i guess i want some of the older things we had back, our friendship used to be fun. Our friendship has come to the point where we hang out, but it’s like we are social distancing ourselves and we’re just on our phones, hardly talk, nothing more.
Its like looking back at childhood dreams and everything being all fun and smiles. Knowing you can’t get back there.

She told me she just wants to be friends and we should have never done any of that, I’m so confused. 
It feels like I’m being forced to take a step back from being a best friend, to just being there. 

I realize everyone has different views in life, I’ve never had a girl best friend that I was so close to so I don’t know how it really works that way. 
But it kind of makes sense to me that there would be a little difference between friend—&gt;bestfriend, on a “close to” scale.
The way I view things, is like layers in (relationships)
It’d be something like 
Friend
Bestfriend (this is where I considered myself)
Friends with benefits (does that belong on here?)
Boyfriend/girlfriend

1640,Goemon30318,1599964863,2,"So i always had a shit life, i suffered allot of abuse and bullying growing up from my parents and schoolmates, this made me scared of people and hate them and as a result it was really hard for me to make friendships this means i retreated to videogames and never really learned any sport, hobby or skills necessary for independece as a result i am 19 year old dood who is trying really hard to be an adult and spent years on this vicios cycle of depression, self hate and loneliness, and im starting to think theres something wrong with me, i´m good looking altough skinny, people think i´m the most eccentric dude ever (aparently), ive always been a lone wolf because people always avoided me for being difrent, and i´m too respectfull and humble towards others, is this why people dont like me enough to keep around for long, is this why they lose intrest, am i too introverted and reserved??

Ill list some cases of friendships i had:

In 2015-2017 i actually had a gaming group of friends this was my highligth, i met this guys called Hamzah and he really helped me, we played all sorts of videogames, talked about life, why we are here, goofed off, shit talked and after 2 years we just grew appart, we had allot of falling outs and sure i was depressed so i tended to push people awaya but why did someone who helped me with loneliness and depression just gets bored and moves on to other people?

During this time i also had someone who i tougth was my best friend, but lo and behold he was just using me cuz i had stuff so that really broke my confidence.

And now we have a more recent case i spent the duration of 2017 and 2020 working on my depression and eventually managed to climb out of this vicios cycle with the help of my friend, this person really helped me with my problems and managed to make me realize a few things, so i became a better person and recovered my studies, became more social, realized not veryone is evil etc. We hung out went biking(a new hobby i didnt knew i was quite good at i can do 40 ks easy, wich is weird since i all i did was play videogames all day up to that point), hang out, vidogames etc, but after a while he stopped hanging out, and to this day we dont really do anything aymore, why? I mean i respect this person allot and owe him my lif but damn dude..

I tried so hard to better myself as a person, managed to somewhat beat my fears leave my comfort zone but even then im still bing looked at funny for being eccentric and weird, im still having trouble making long lasting friends and i feel like no one wants me, my mother and father were abusive and i dont really have a family, im tired of being alone, and all my reaches end in failure and ive never been truly loved( i think).

I wish i could have a friend like the dude from 2015, that feeling of having someone with similiar background always watch your back, hanging out, talking about life and playing after school, idk what is wrong with me, am i such a bad boring person?

She was very well educated with a master's degree from a top college. Couldn't be farther from my upbringing.

Never supports me and makes me feel less than daily. 20 years I give her and adore her. To finally wake up one day to realize I am an unpaid unlaid maid.

I 😮 I dont know what to say now.... i was just writing what was on my mind so I'm sorry if its not very coherant.... also am not even sure this is the right subreddit for this kind of discussion 😞😞😞 but i guess its nice to just talk how you feel in a safe environment instead of just holding it in

But gosh, I just don't want to live a life where I literally have no social life outside my immediate family. I'm not the kind of person who is close with coworkers since I like keeping work and personal life separate, and I avoid social media cos it makes me feel sad sometimes.

1668,defaultband-aid,1599945131,8,"Dear readers,

Hello everyone, if you’re reading this post it’s probably because like me you’ve been feeling lonely over the past several months. At first, it was innocently humorous, we saw the Carl Weezer memes saying “she’s in quarantine if she doesn’t text back she never will.” 

Well here’s the right shitty part of it, i’ve had very little issue finding women to accompany me during the pandemic, but my male friends? Nowhere to be found.

Now I understand that two of my close friends moved away last month due to circumstances out of their control. Thankfully only one of them has been my friend my whole life.

I digress, the reason I’m writing this today is because of the sheer lack on effort on the end of my male counterparts to simply be a good friend. I spent the past several days speaking only to my professor in my online lectures, and where I used to hate class I now cherish it as the only interaction with humans over the course of my week. I think it’s worth noting that i’m normally the type of person that just tries to dismiss this type of behavior, assuming that my friends are just busy. However; my critical thinking skills lead me to the conclusion that there’s plenty of time in a day to send someone a text saying “hello”.

Just to benefit my mental health, I’vr taken to starting my days by keeping my phone face down on my bedside table. Only after i’ve gotten a good workout in, had breakfast, and found something to do by myself for the day do I pick up my phone. The dopamine rush that is obtained from a vibration- i don’t get them anymore. The reason why is because i’ve turned off notifications for every social media app. I do this for two reasons. 

1.) The expectation that my typical friends I stay in touch with would meet my halfway was in vain. I’m constantly keeping conversations afloat and it was simply better to turn off vibrations than to think my phone was going off every time I felt a ghost vibration, just to pick my phone out of my pocket 18x in a half hour just check if anyone found it kind enough in their heart to not perpetually leave me on read and actually maintain a conversation collaboratively.

2.) I feel that people who take 3 days to respond to a “hey what’s up” text don’t deserve my instant response, or much less response within 30 minutes.

Maybe i’m too cynical, you tell me.

If you’re feeling this way, please comment below, i’d like people to find common ground in their stories and if we can do that, maybe we can make surviving alone a bit more bearable 🐻 

Thanks for reading. I look forward to reading and responding to your stories below- if you feel like sharing.",lonely,I appreciate you,2020-09-13 07:12:11

Maybe I’m meant to be alone. I’m an only child with an abusive family, so I have been chronically alone my whole life. 

It’s sad not having anyone to share with or connect to. I’ve created a life full of memories that no one will ever know or care about except for me. No one knows me. No one has witnessed my existence. 

My loneliness is unbearable, but since I can’t force people to care about me, all I can do is learn to accept it. 

I have a lot to be grateful for in my life. 

I’m grateful for my cats. I’m grateful for my resilience and resourcefulness. I’m grateful for my apartment and my big bed. I’m grateful that I have the opportunity to order yummy food to be delivered for dinner tonight. 

My ego is telling me the story that I am not worthy of love or consideration. 

I’ve heard this story before. Instead of believing it, I’m going to remind myself that I’m worthy of my own love and consideration. 

When my loneliness feels too heavy, I’ll put my hand over my heart and say to myself out loud, “I’ll keep you safe.”

On the hardest days of my life, I have been there for myself. And I’ll keep showing up for myself. I am becoming a version of my future self that makes me proud.

Just someone you occasionally go out with. My efforts to do something are often rejected by excuses or the typical ""sorry I already have some plans for today"" texts. However I need the occasional socializing, otherwise I would completely lose myself in isolation. School is starting on monday and I was really hoping to have at least one good night before this really hard and stressful time begins again. You see, I have dyscalcolia (idk if you write it like that) it's basically the same as dyslexia, but with maths, logical thinking etc. Which makes my school life extremely difficult and frustrating. It is really tiring to try so hard just to be mediocre at best.  All my ""friends"" are at a summer end birthday party of one of their friends and I was obviously not invited. However I did not want to spend the Saturday night alone in my room. So I went out drinking with my last 20 bucks. My sexuality is also a huge problem. Which I kinda don't want to go into immediately, but I am as far from having a relationship or sex or even a kiss as you can be. I know I am only 17, but its hard if literally everyone you know already had a relationship or at least sex. I did fall in love but that just ruined me even more. I am really not fond of my body. Idk what the medical term for it is, but my chest is somehow ingrown and in my eyes it looks extremely disgusting and pathetic. I haven't been swimming in 3 years because of it. You see, my family is not really the understanding type of family and besides that we are rather poor. I have to share a room with my 2 siblings. (middle child syndrome is also a thing). So surgery is not an option because one hand we can't afford it and also they are not letting me do it, because they don't view it as necessary. Its problematic, because the condition isn't just cosmetic. I have pretty bad pain in my shoulders, neck and back because all the muscles are shortened because if the ingrown chest. I was basically doing nothing all summer long. I always hoped that things would turn out to be fine, as long as I keep my head high. I train every day, I go for walks, I study a lot. But the pain does not go away. School is only getting harder. My loneliness is eating my up from the inside. I am at a breaking point and don't know really know what to do anymore.

It was a complete accident, but I didn't realize the damage until afterwards (a deep cut, bumps, bruises, headaches).  Now a scar on the nose and annoying headaches. The friend said was sorry but did not seem sincere and downplayed my hurt at the time. I expressed my emotions and wanted to discuss and settle this issue in person, only to get completely shutdowned and basically was told it was my problem to deal with. Said friend has avoided me since then and I have stopped reaching out.

It's been so long since I've ever actually hugged somebody. The thing I most desire now is to just be able to hug someone or at least have 1 good friend I can hangout with. 

Ever since quarantine started I've been alone and haven't hung out with anybody because I don't have any strong friends.

At school I could tell that everybody seemed to like me, but never enough to actually try and text me or ask if I wanted to go some where. And now my school is all online

It sucks because all around me people are posting about the outings they have while I'm just stuck at home with no friends to talk to.

The only day I look forward to are sundays because that's when my older brothers visit but that's only once a week, and I get depressed thinking how the only friends I have are my brothers.

I just wish that I could find at least one person who would invite me regularly to go out or something. 

Ive been dying to feel the touch of a hug because the last time I had one from someone who wasn't family was at least four years ago.

I am a 35F.  I'm autistic and disabled w a rare disease contagious to others.  I spend most of my day managing my disease and have little physical or emotional energy left for people.  There is no cure.  Only 60 people in the country have this.

I cannot work or generate income, and most of my hobbies have bevome sidelined due to lack of energy, money, interest, or the disease itself.

I live and breathe for interpersonal connections of all kinds, but it is hard to make them because of how much of my life the disease eats up.  Partner-wise, being autistic always made me ""too much"" for people, but now with my disease it is even harder bc in addition to not having the energy, I am rejected bc of people not wanting to caregive, as well as rejected because sex is difficult if not impossible.

People who have loved me romantically and platonically have abused and abandoned me bc they didn't want to caregive me.  This and the disease have traumatized me beyond measure.

It's been 7 years long horrible years and I think it's time I give up on the hope of a family or coherent partnership, as well as having functional interpersonal relationships that aren't superficial friendships.

HOW do I do this?  I need to figure out how to accept this and change focus onto something else or I will die.  Most other activities in my life I cannot do or they don't fulfill me.  I am so profoundly lonely and so profoundly tired (physically and emotionally) I don't want to/can't do any more relational work.  I know when I am defeated.

How did you accept you were going to live your life alone and be okay with it?  

I need to find something to hold onto or I will not survive.  (I promised to give myself a year to try and make these adjustments or I will manufacture my own exit to relieve my family of financial burden.  A lot can change in a year, so it's not unreasonable.)

Please, no suggestions of:

-Psych meds--  part of my rare disease causes hypersensitivity reactions to most medications, including these, as I've learned from experience.

-Therapy--  I have been to at least 18 therapists.  They turn me away bc they are afraid to give therapy bc of the rare disease (which affects my brain via inflammation).  They don't know what to do or accuse me of faking.

If you pay attention you can almost pinpoint the very moment that the delusion of happiness begins to crack and the bleakness of reality starts to ooze in like sludge. First comes the fall and then shortly after comes the crash. So what’s the answer? To find love? A “soul mate” as people seem to refer to it as, to find someone as miserable as I am so we can bask in the numbness together, a true friend to confide in. When in reality we were never meant to be at all, we only experienced a manic form of delusion driven by the overbearing emotions of loneliness and lust. Some people pray for this feeling to end, they begin to rationalise the irrational thought that their life is in the hands of something greater than themselves, that there is a life after death, so you best believe you better spend your ever waking fucking moments with a fake smile plastered on your face.

By never, I literally mean at no point in time, by no-one. Not even family, let alone friends. It broke my heart. 

I cried that night to sleep. And then, I cried yesterday night as well for 1 hour. I thought about this so much that I actually dreamt of cuddling a classmate, yesterday. Even though the cuddle felt super nice, it made me feel worse (after waking up) because I realized it was just a dream.

It's not like I can't continue living without physical contact but for some reason, it just hits home. In fact, I do not feel safe in confiding to any other human being. I do not know whether this is due to a lack of contact or just plain insecurity. Instead, I have loads of teddies that I sleep with and cuddle every night. I confide to the teddies.

1751,innerlemons,1599873260,1,"2020 started with one of the happiest times of my life. After a year of saving, I faced my lifelong fear of flying and took two weeks off work to go visit two of my penpals in a foreign country. I stayed with two different families and they were both wonderful. Every night there were people around the dinner table who asked about my day. People made plans and remembered to invite me. I had a couple of anxiety attacks (I have panic disorder) and no one insulted me or made passive-aggressive remarks. No one thought less of me because I'm 30 and don't drive, or because I don't have a high paying career. They just accepted me for who I was. All of them. 

Then I came home to a world imploding. I was back at work for two weeks before we were shut down for covid. And ever since, borders have been closed and I can't even daydream about seeing my friends again. I miss them so much, sometimes it's physically painful. But is it THEM I miss, or the feeling that I was safe and wanted? A little of both, maybe. 

The friends I met are having bad mental health symptoms because of the isolation from lockdowns, so our communication has been strained. There just aren't a lot of positive things to talk about. But I crave so badly to go back to how things were, when my long days at work (slow retail job) were filled with voice notes and emails letting me know how excited they were to see me. I want someone to be excited to see me. 

I don't know where to turn to expand my social circle. As I said, I don't drive because my claustrophobic anxiety is severe enough where I can't travel without something to distract me from the road. Reading, a game app on my Kindle, something that takes all my focus. I don't want to go on dating sites because I have a very, very low libido (maybe asexual?) and I don't want to disappoint some guy. And all the in-person social events I used to enjoy are cancelled.

I am in college in a small town who the majority is mostly the midwestern farm stereotype to a T.  I've been a social recluse since coming to college, and other than a few relationships and the occasional hookup, I get no real social interaction. My coworkers are great, but nobody whom I feel a deep platonic connection with. Same goes with classmates (pre-covid).   


I started talking to a coworker (way other side of the store) through Tinder and we get along but we don't click really. It's mostly tapered off now and we don't talk much. It's not that I have nothing to talk about, but anything inquiring about personal life/hobbies/passions we get nowhere. It's not just her, but about 95% of the girls I meet are like this. I'm sure my idea of ""if I can't get a decent work/text convo why would I bother with a date"" screws me over in instances like this.

Lack of passions/interests are something my other friends complain about when it comes to dating as well, so I assumed it was the norm.

Now I'm a single mother and once again, and I had a realization yesterday that I will never find a normal decent guy who is interested in me. I figured this out when I got sexually harassed at work by this gross older man in his 50s, stuck in a wheelchair with a disgusting beer gut. The only kind of man who ever seems to want me is guys like THAT. Single in their 50s, gross, probably haven't ever been in a relationship because they're creepy and don't groom themselves. I know I'm ugly and I'm plus size, but goddamn. If women on My 600lb Life can find decent men, or drug addicts on Intervention can have nice boyfriends and husbands, why can't I? I don't drink, smoke, do drugs...I got two Bachelor degrees in college, I dress feminine in skirts and dresses. What's wrong with me?? Why do I draw creeps to me and not decent men??

It's then I get this really strong crushing feeling of pain, anxiety, grief and sadness in my stomach and chest. Last year around this year i had a really hard time when i ended highschool and all my older friends moved, on top of that me and my girlfriend had problems and I just ended up all alone, without anyone. I was crying almost every night for three months and was feeling so low as never before, I carried this feeling inside of me all the time and a lot of times I couldn't even take a deep breath. 

Even when my friends are back and have time, they spend their time with everyone beside me and it makes me feel like they have completely abandoned me and left me outside of their life. It hurts me so much and makes me feel so alone… I tried to talk to them about how i feel and they assured me that we are still friends but they still don't meet up or show any interest in me whatsoever. This together with that I had to quit a sport i played on an elite level all my life, last year have left me with so much time alone in this state of mind and with this feeling. 

Since last year I have made two or three new friends, and even though i have a great family and a girlfriend i just moved in with, this feeling just won't disappear how hard i yet fight it and i'm coming to a point where i just feel so hopeless cause i don't know what more i could do against it.

I am a senior at the University of Connecticut and over the past few months my team and I along with the sociology department at UConn have been working hard to develop a workshop to help college students attain more meaningful and purposeful lives. Given the stress of COVID-19 and the lack of mental health resources available across the nation, I invite each of you to join our two day seminar and meet individuals from across the nation as you develop the skills needed to live a more meaningful life. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Posted below are more details about the seminar: 

How can one attain a meaningful life without knowing what it is that they value? 

In this webinar, we will demonstrate that many people live their lives without the framework necessary to achieve true purpose. We will help you identify a set of “core values,” and demonstrate how to live your life according to your self-identified value structure so as to realize a meaningful life.

This webinar will take place over two, 45 minute zoom meetings. You must attend the first meeting in order to join the second. In between meetings you will be given one, ten minute reflective assignment to support your growth and learning.

Meeting 1: Thursday, Sept. 24th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

Meeting 2: Saturday, Sept. 26th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

1788,Reaper_02,1599843222,1,"This past week I spent some time with a day 1 friend and she really opened up my eyes on how I really am and how I have changed. I always think people j don’t care abt me. I never post on social media, I archived all my insta posts so I don’t have any pictures on my insta anymore. Never post on Snapchat stories. I’m virtually a ghost when it comes to social media. If someone doesn’t talk to me I don’t talk to them and never will until someone reaches out to me. Her telling me how she is always the one who reaches out to me and texts me first, always is the one to Snapchat me bc I always leave her on open really made me open my eyes on how everyone else sees me bc I am pretty much the same with everyone else except my best friends. Is this a bad characteristic to have ? 

I used to be outgoing, funny and social. I think I have changed to be like this because of girls. I’ve had one gf my junior year and that lasted a year, nothing was wrong in the relationship I j moved and broke it off. Ever since I’ve tried and tried with girls but have gotten lead on endless times and it HURTS so I j stopped trying.

It's just I have no friends man. I'm a 25 year old stay at home dad, my mrs earns way more money than I ever could and works 50+ hours a week so I just clean up and look after my kid 24/7.

I'm in a small village where I know absolutley nobody and just have no clue how i could meet anyone. I dont really drink and I dont work so it's quite tough. 

I sometimes go out alone to walk or ride my bike and last couple of days I've seen some skater kids on some new tarmac on an industrial estate but I dont know how I can just ride up an be like hi wanna be my friend lol.

Also I was thinking its probably weird to just approach teenagers at my age looking for friendship haha so I just shouted do a kickflip, watched the kickflip and left. 

I'm thinking about starting a climbing gym to possibly meet some friends but I already know I'm just gonna be stood in the place alone watching other people an their friends laugh n joke and its honestly just kinda depressing.

My best friend from childhood got a girlfriend and he wont leave her house so I literally haven't seen him in 2 years now. I've messaged multiple times offering to pick him up for a night but hes just not interested. 

My other good friend from my teens is still a good lad and we have hung out a few times but hes just moved to london so probably wont see him much now (not that I seen him often anyway). 

I should probably just suck it up, bcus I know people are much more lonely than me and have much worse issues to contend with but I just wanted somewhere to vent a little I guess.

I work really hard to make sure all my friends and family are happy and well loved and cared for; I’m always the mom friend, forever picking up and dropping folks off, and I’m the only one in my friend group who has moved away from my childhood home, so my place is always the hang out spot. And I love doing that, I love taking care of people, and I’m happy that they want to spend time in my place, but if I’m not constantly offering them value in this form, their conditional friendships disappear. These are the best friends I’ve ever had, and I’m starting to wonder whether I will ever find people who take care of me even half as much as I try to take care of them. 

Additionally, I went on an antidepressant last year, and gained a fair amount of weight from it. All my girlfriends are super slim and tall, and I’m petite and curvy even without the weight gain, so I always felt a bit awkward about my body around them. But recently it’s escalated to a point of me often feeling like they’re embarrassed to be seen with me or be my friend because I’m now overweight, and it’s really hard to tell whether I’m project my own insecurities or if they really are embarrassed of me. I’ve gone off the meds, and I’m trying to lose weight, but it’s hard and it will likely take me a full year to get back to my starting weight in a sustainable and healthy way. 

Lastly, I recently came out of the closet as a lesbian. I am very lucky to have a kind and accepting group of friends, so this hasn’t affected our friendships. But, I’ve only ever dated women briefly, and I worry that I won’t ever find a woman who’s attracted to me. As a femme presenting, short and overweight gal, I am very much not the lesbian stereotype. All I want in life is to fall in love with a wonderful woman, and marry her, have a healthy relationship and a couple kids, and do the whole domestic thing. Have a good and loving family. I’m scared no one will ever love me enough to want that with me. Anyone else going through this or something similar? Anyone have any advice?",lonely,Feeling Unloved,2020-09-11 16:31:35

1822,Papaya_playa2,1599804791,1,"I am currently a junior in college, and my journey to finding friends after high school has been slow and rough. Before college, I had a close-knit group of friends that I am still close to now, but we all go to different colleges so i only see them over holidays. As a freshman, I struggled to make close friends. While I made several acquaintances with hall mates, classmates, and members of clubs that I joined, I never felt satisfied with the depth of any of my friendships. I didn’t have a tight friend group or people that I felt like I belonged to. Sure, I had people to sit with in class, people I would study with, and people I would say hi to throughout the day, but when it came to my free time or Friday nights, I had no one. By the end of freshman year, my mental health had taken a hit and the long periods of trying to hide my loneliness and pretend like I was loving college created permanent anxiety around feeling alone. 

Fast forward 2 years, and I have made some improvements, but I still struggle with feeling insecure and lonely. I became friends with a group that already knew each other really well, and while they have significantly improved my college experience, I still feel like I’m not fully part of the group yet. For example, I’m often left out of group chats, or if I’m invited to something it’s through an extension of an invite that had already been sent in a group chat that I am not part of. I just don’t know how to get past being the background friend. Every so often, I become fearful that they don’t actually like me and they’re just being nice because they pity me. And while I am aware that some of these thoughts are unfounded, I also know that they are all closer to eachother than they are to me. In other words, I am everyone’s friend but no ones best friend. Maybe they don’t realize that they are the closest thing I have to a friend group, or maybe they don’t actually see me as part of the group. 

This fear of not being truly a part of the group makes me isolate myself whenever I feel unwanted or forgotten. It’s also late enough in college where I likely won’t make any other close friends, especially with COVID. Any advice on becoming close to the members of a  friend group when you’re the “new kid” in the group? I just cannot accept the possibility of going through 4 years of college with no close friends to show for it.",lonely,An Ode to the Background Friend,2020-09-11 16:13:11

1845,baebaexo,1599784975,1,"I would talk out loud and they would respond back in my head. The older I got the less I continued this, but I never fully stopped. Every once in a while a wave of loneliness would hit hard and there I'd go again, pretending to have a conversation with someone who was not there, someone who would love me, someone who would actually want me.

Don't get me wrong, these were not imaginary friends. I am and was fully aware I was both parties and participating in these conversations alone. But it helped, it always helped.

Now fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. Feeling sad, feeling alone, feeling like the world will never give me a chance and the urge to comfort myself via another fake conversation struck so I sat down to talk to myself. To pretend I was hearing the words of comfort and love from another human being. And I had this ridiculous idea to record myself. So I did, and I listened to the audio and cringe aside, it was actually quite soothing, therapeutic. I genuinely felt better. I don't know why, I can't explain it.

I wanted to chase this feeling so I kept doing it. And then I thought, huh I wonder if other people would enjoy this? Would this help anyone else? So I created a YouTube channel and started uploading and it's been a week since I've started and it's the craziest thing, I genuinely feel really good I don't know why.

It's not like I've taken off or anything, it's not like I'm getting a million subs or having people tell me they love my videos. I'm not necessarily doing it for them. I'm doing it for me and this really cathartic sensation it brings to record the audio and play it back. It's like a shot of serotonin straight into my brain, it makes me feel so good.

I love the idea of comforting other people who feel the same loneliness I feel. And I love love love this feeling I get every time I finish recording. This beats therapy, this may even beat loneliness.

I don't even know why I'm writing this to be honest, I just want reassurance maybe that I'm not going crazy. Because I genuinely get a high when I finish recording. Is this feeling normal? Have I finally lost it?

If you're still reading and you got this far I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read my ramblings. I don't know if I'm going to be alone forever, but this feeling right now, it feels so good that I actually don't mind being alone and doing my own thing.

I don't want this to come off as a promotion post or anything like that because that is absolutely not the reason I decided to sit down here tonight and write this wall of text. But I do want to throw my channel here in case any of what I said about the kind of videos I'm making sounds like something someone would want to watch to help them feel less alone.

And who knows, this is working out so well for me maybe everyone should try having imaginary conversations about being loved and recording them then playing it back for yourself. Maybe that jolt of serotonin will hit you too. I don't really have anything else to say other than be kind to yourself, be kind to others. The world is cruel enough. I hope whoever is reading this is okay and that you hang in there.

Good luck friends

Sorry, this one is going to be a bit long.

I graduated from high school in June. I‘m a year ahead so I won’t be turning 18 until next year. All my friends are going to college now, except me. The first reason being that I’m not 18 yet, and the second (and most important) reason being that college doesn’t interest me at all. I felt pressured in school, I know what I wanna do in life, and I don’t want to waste my time with something I will barely be interested in when I can actually work by myself on something that makes me happy.

That may seems irrelevant. But now that I think about, the only positive thing about college is that I would have been able to meet new people. Meeting girls in particular. And here I am, spending most of my time at home, in my room, working everyday on something I’m not even sure will be successful, but staying hopeful still and trying my best.

I had a similar feeling during summer. A lot of people say that I look older than I really am, so I tried some dating apps. The few attempts at matching with someone I found to be interesting weren’t successful, at all. And in fact, in the end, I don’t think it’s a good idea to go on these kind of apps. I do not find myself ugly though, even if I’m a bit self conscious about my hair sometimes, I consider myself to be kinda good looking.

But I just feel so alone. My relationship with my family is a pure mess and I haven’t had a positive love experience with someone in years (perhaps never actually). It’s like I’m never gonna meet anyone I have a deep connection with, like I’m gonna be the miserable depressed guy I am today for the rest of my life. Sometimes I just wanna cry thinking about it. Because I know it’s no one else but my fault, and I can’t blame anyone but me.

You could say “Welp, you still got your friends”. And you’d be right. I have a few loving friends that I love talking to. But that just doesn’t help filling the void that’s inside of me for some reason. It’s just a very complicated moment.

The bulk of which stems from the fact that I can’t for the life of me manage to get into a relationship with a girl who I find attractive who also finds me attractive. I wasn’t worried about getting into a relationship in high school and thought college would be different (“4 YEARS of college? ill obviously get a girlfriend at SOME point i shouldn’t worry about it now”), but here I am. Over the past 3-4 years I have been crying nonstop because everything that college was supposed to be was right but that was for everyone around me and not for me for some reason like some kind of sick joke. I have always felt like there was something wrong with me growing up, its very difficult for me to socialize and meet new people (I feel like girls can *sense* that theres something off about me which makes me sad because i think im a pretty good guy) and quarantine has made me realize how pathetic and lonely my life is now and will be for the foreseeable future. Im finally at a breaking point and im tired of seeing the looks on girls faces when i try to approach them with a smile on mine, i can’t do it anymore. All of those around me are in or have had at least one if not several relationships and I can’t get it out of my head how wonderful it must feel to put your arms around a girl who also loves you, it’s killing me inside and I hate that I can’t figure out what is wrong with me. 

Supplementary info:

-I have never been in a relationship despite being part of multiple social groups (member of football team, member of a fraternity, member of a club based on an interest of mine)

-I have never been loved by someone of the opposite sex besides my mom

-I’ve gone on 1 date with a girl freshman year and I thought it went well and we held hands at one point and i can’t even express into words how happy that made me, that was by far the happiest ive ever been in my life and i thought things were finally changing for me, but she ended up ghosting me after

-I feel like every day im getting massively behind on personal growth and confidence from my peers and i feel like im still stuck in high school

-Every time I realize how lonely I am and how pathetic it is that I’ve gone through so many social experiences without having a girl (which is a few times per day) i break down and cry, and every time I do that i then think about how pathetic it is that im a guy who cries literally every day and how sad that is (and why would a girl want to be with someone like that, like a vicious cycle) but i just can’t help it

-I have considered therapy but one I can’t afford it, and two I dont believe speaking to someone about my problems will resolve the underlying, concrete issues that would lead to me actually getting better

-I was planning on going out a lot this semester/year to hopefully at least try something different but quarantine has closed everything down so i have no opportunities to change my situation. I even did some random approaches to girls i thought were cute on campus but i already mentioned what happened with those..

-I have tried a number of different dating apps, tinder/bumble/pof, and i bought gold/premium on those with no success



-Ive technically had sex 6 times with girls who were very unattractive or very drunk

-I had a chance to get into a relationship with two different girls but I wasn’t attracted to them and so it wouldn’t have been fair to them for me to put them in that situation

-I have a few close friends and they all have a bunch of experience with dating and it feels like the longer i go the more they think there’s something wrong with that guy

-I guess what im wondering is if anyone has been in a situation like mine and if you ever got out of it. Like does it get better? is it worth it? I just dont see a reason to keep going anymore

1856,UConn_2020,1599780272,1,"Hey everyone, 

I am a senior at the University of Connecticut and over the past few months my team and I along with the sociology department at UConn have been working hard to develop a workshop to help individuals attain more meaningful and purposeful lives. Given the stress of COVID-19 and the lack of mental health resources available across the nation, I invite each of you to join our two day seminar and meet people from across the nation as you develop the skills needed to live a more meaningful life. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. Posted below are more details about the seminar: 

How can one attain a meaningful life without knowing what it is that they value? 

In this webinar, we will demonstrate that many people live their lives without the framework necessary to achieve true purpose. We will help you identify a set of “core values,” and demonstrate how to live your life according to your self-identified value structure so as to realize a meaningful life.

This webinar will take place over two, 45 minute zoom meetings. You must attend the first meeting in order to join the second. In between meetings you will be given one, ten minute reflective assignment to support your growth and learning.

Meeting 1: Thursday, Sept. 24th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

Meeting 2: Saturday, Sept. 26th from 5:00pm to 5:45pm

**Register here by Tuesday, September 15th**:

1857,Jstepthrowaway,1599778276,1,"Went out to a university social gathering today and I feel horrible about it.
My thought process before it was that it will be more beneficial for me because I’ll be outside with my classmates, get to know them and maybe leave a positive impression.
Coming home now I know that I socially blundered hard. I felt like I was socially inting (doing bad social decisions every time).
My eye contact was crap, I couldn’t come up with things to ask or say and I could feel it in my soul how I made everyone I interacted with uncomfortable. I’m confident that I left a sour impression to each and every one of them.
I even read How to win friends and influence people to improve but every time I felt in my mind how I broke every principle whenever I opened my mouth.
I really don’t want to feel lonely and I really tried to put myself out there in hopes of finding a glimmer of hope but now I’m just left with intense feeling of loneliness, like I’m destined to feel lonely for the rest of my life.
I don’t know how I’ll be able to face my classmates knowing that I left a negative mark.

And now I’m college It’s only been two week in, but I’m already giving up on the idea of making friends or finding a relationship bc people simply wont approach me and act really hesitant when I’m first to make conversation. 

People are generally confused when I say I’ve never been in a relationship since I’m relatively attractive, but people who’ve had crushes on me never tell me in the moment but rather months after their feelings dissipate, simply because they were scared or intimidated.

We’re both the same age and we enjoy the same things like this year I pre-ordered the both of us the new Avengers game because we both love Marvel to bits and is kind of our role models growing up as our parents weren’t really the kind you could look up to.

Long story short he had been diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago and it was by far the hardest news I have ever had so I spent as much time together and he beat it not once but twice over the 2 years. He was an absolute soldier in my eyes and as I was the older one out of us I couldn’t stop but admire his bravery as he always held that grin, his cheeky smile, but last month due to the after effects of his chemo his white blood cell level was reduced to 0 and he was struggling with all sorts of health problems from easy bruising, cuts and everything involving physical yet he still trained and kept on top of his fitness.

The hardest thing was we couldn’t spent much time together recently and we couldn’t see each other as much until the week before he passed away. I just remember holding him in my arms and then the sudden news hearing he went into a coma and his brain died. I completely lost and still am. My mind has been all over the place, I have no one I can talk to anymore, no one to play that Avengers and most painful thing is that he never got to live his life, he had to live with his cancer after he finished school and this hurts me so much and makes me feel so alone knowing and sympathising with what he went through, I hoped he didn’t feel lonely in his final moments as I do now, just everything is flashing through my mind and I still can’t over it, this overwhelming feeling hurts so much and I will never show this side to my family as this would hurt so much more as everyone is slowly trying their best to move on.

I know this probably ain’t right subreddit for this but I really wanted/needed to get this off my chest, please tell your loved ones you love them, hug them and don’t let go because I wish I did.

I just feel like I don't want to live with myself or my family and 'friends' anymore. Quarantine is making it hard for me to find somewhere else to spend time at so I could escape all the shit that's going on with my life. I've had 4 attempts already and they were all a failure. Depending on how I feel, I pretty much get either glad or angry that I'm still here. I get tormented with things I have no control over and everyone throws their shit at me. I don't want to deal with this. I want to die. Either a fast, peaceful death or a slow painful one that hurts everyone around me (if they cared) the way they did. Anything would do. I just want to disappear and never go back. This thought is ALWAYS at the back of my mind. I keep asking myself why nothing I do is worth anything despite the restless nights and effort I had spent in doing anything for myself or the others. If it's something for me, I'm selfish as fuck. If it's for the others, it's always not enough. Would people even notice if I silently disappeared one day? I doubt it. People keep me in their lives for their own advantage. It's never about me. They think I'm stupid to not notice but I do. I *always* do. I just brush it off.

Just...what's the fastest way that can kill me today?

This normally happens when I have time to think. In fact, I'm remembering how much I like to drown in my thoughts. It's like inner peace to me. But sometimes, that peace turns to questioning. Sometimes I wonder what they think when I text them or invite them to an online game. And usually when they're the conversation starter, I'm always happy, knowing that at least someone wants to talk to me.

Other times I think of how short life really is. I'm only 15, just starting high school, and I sometimes tell myself things like "" You're wasting your youth, go do something eventful."" Now, with these conditions, its much harder. I just wish I knew how to make things more eventful in my youth.

And sometimes, much more than the others, I just want someone by my side. I wish I had the power and knowledge to know exactly when I can talk to my friends, since I'm litterally one of the only people that has a bunch of free time on a daily basis. And I wish I could be with my girlfriend. I know people say you shouldn't date early in life, but things have always gone well. At least relationship wise. We met in like 3rd grade and we've been best friends ever since. We weren't in the same classes, so the only time we got together was recess and bus rides. Then we moved on to intermediate school and were put in completly different sections in the school. Again, only recess and bus for us. We would also meet at out of school activities frequently, but then I suddenly had to move, and had to say goodbye to all my friends I knew since elementary. Now, for the past 3 or so years, we've been in a long distance relationshp. Now before people start saying this is a red flag, just know that I've put a lot of thought into it, and we've always talked, never ihnoring eachother. Nothing has really gone wrong ever since the move. We just need to get through highschool. Those words always give me a little anxiety, along with school relationships only work out in a 1/100 chance, while also being long distance which could lower the chances by much more. But a lot of people have seen us and knownour bond, and really do believe things could work out. 

That whole essay about my relationship was just to say that what I would like most is to be with her again. Physically, I should add. Gosh, I really do talk about her too much.

Anyways, I just want to know:
Is this common?
Why do I feel like this?
How should I cope with it?
Should I be more open with my friends and family?

1934,oofouchmyeyes69,1599712438,1,"Context:
I’m 16(M) currently living in the US. I’m in my Junior year of high school. I grew up mostly playing video games and surrounding myself with people who liked video games as well. I’ve got (learned) social anxiety and recently found myself with real friends for the first time.

I went through my early years of school as a social butterfly having fun and being the class clown, but I never hung out with anyone after school, so I played video games by myself everyday once I got home. I would try to hang out with other people, but I couldn’t fit in anywhere. This process happened throughout my middle school years and halfway into my high school career. I tried to fit many roles, but I fit nowhere. Groups would push me out any chance they could, sometimes because other people didn’t want to hang out with me.

Eventually I became friends with the kid who bullied me, but that’s a long story. After getting to know him more, he would insult me and tell other people everything embarrassing about me. Sometimes he would insult me in front of others and make sure he made fun of me while I was right next to them. He would tell me I’m worthless, a piece of shit, and other things like that. I ended up with extreme social anxiety and cannot socialize with some people anymore because of it. I ended the friendship at a point because I couldn’t take it anymore, but he threatened me with assault if I didn’t talk to him. I eventually had nobody to go to and became depressed. I got used to his insults and forgot compliments were real at times. He got into marijuana and peer pressured me into trying it as well. I liked it, but not because I thought it was cool, it helped me not think about sad I was. Once I was in my Freshman year of high school, I ghosted him. I deleted him off of everything I could think of and tried to get ahead in my classes so I didn’t have classes with him. I quit marijuana at the same time since he was my only way to get it. I went through two years of having no friends, nobody to talk to about my feelings. I couldn’t even try to talk to my parents about my feelings. It just wouldn’t happen. I met a kid in my softmore year who brought me into a group where everyone is accepting and vented to each other. Everyone there has their problems, but it was easier when you could tell people about it.
Currently:
Since May, I’ve met people who are accepting and have similar interests as me. We laugh and have great times, mostly over a group chat, but enjoyed hanging out in real life. I’m so incredibly grateful to have these people to vent to and share my feelings with, but I need something more.

I have never held hands or even kissed a female (that I’m interested in) in my life. I just want to have someone to care for, to embrace, and to share my deeper problems with. I’ve been rejected many times when I was younger. I haven’t been complimented by a female in years. I thought real friends would alleviate this aching, but they don’t. I still have this empty feeling that good friends can’t fill. I know this doesn’t really fit the subreddit, but I needed somewhere to say this.

Many points of my life I’ve contemplated the idea of suicide, mostly because of the toxic relationship with my friend through middle school and the beginning of high school. Suicide is not the answer for anything. It’s not worth it. There is always something better ahead, but you have to take the right steps to make progress.

1970,kbabyblue,1599689887,1,"This will be a long read as I just want to explain how I became lonely and how I dealt with it.

It seems everybody here is lonely and depressed and sees loneliness as a completely bad thing. I am 22 years old now and I have been lonely on and off for as far back as I can remember.

It never really hit me how lonely I was till I left school for college, as loneliness was just a natural part of my life, my mum and dad never talked to me or did anything with me ever so at a very young age being alone was just a part of my life.

So due to this when I was forced to go school it was out of the ordinary for me, I've gone from not talking to anyone, seeing anyone or leaving the house to suddenly being around loads of other kids and adults. This obviously affected me mentally and I developed anxiety, selective mutism and I didn't say a single word for the 6-7 years I was there.

Once I got into secondary school I started to talk but because I hardly ever talked before then I somehow developed a lisp and now I was being bullied for talking. Getting bullied actually humbles you and teaches you a lot, if you have ever been bullied one thing you would never do is bully someone else.

I actually got my first girlfriend when I was 14-15 and had some friends but I was still lonely, the thing is they all had someone or people outside of school they hanged around with but when I'm not at school I have nobody and I'm just sat at home all day, it didn't help either that I lived 5 miles away from school and my friends.

On the last year of school my life was actually improving socially, as I started making a lot of effort to hang around with my friends after school, like walking 5 miles to go see them or spending my lunch money on bus/taxis.

But one decision was about to change everything, once school finished you could go to college or stay at school and do something called six form which means you do your college there at school but you have to apply to get accepted by them. long story short, most my friends got in and I didn't.

So shortly after I lost contact with all of them as I couldn't bare to walk 5 miles anymore and I no longer had lunch money to get me there. Also anxiety came back to bite me in the ass, I couldn't hold down a job.

My father decided to lay down an ultimatum, get out the house, which means I would be homeless, get a job or go college. I picked the one that would give me the least anxiety and this is when i started a 3 year course in college in something I didn't want to do because I felt I had no hope in anything else.

College was no different than school, had friends and a girlfriend(who I later found was cheating on me) at college but was still lonely and once college finished I had no friends again. So when college finished I was fed up with life and went off the rails and selfishly brought a girl I met at college with me, i got drunk everyday, I got stoned everyday and I did cocaine now and then with this girl, I mostly stayed with her because she was pretty rich and paid for everything.

Took a year for her to realise I was just a lonely loser, so happened to be when she stopped getting wrecked with me aswell and she decided to move on with her life.

Shortly after my cousin moved in with us because he was homeless, he came just in time as I was in a period of contemplating suicide. He was a super social person, always out doing something and had lots of friends so he brought me along with him every where he went and we became super close as we liked the same things and we both had anxiety aswell.

This lasted a year as well until one day he just got up and moved in with his girlfriend and when I tried to stay in contact he mainly just ignored me. This broke my heart more than anything has and affected me deeply.

At this point I was more depressed and suicidal than I have ever been, I'm back to where I have always been but this time I actually had nobody. 3 years, 4 stone in weight gained and bunch of health issues later here I am finally back on track, but not because of anybody else, but because of myself.

I was planning on bettering my life this year but corona virus kinda delayed it but the major turning point was my uncle recently died. He died alone in his 30's, had anxiety like me and was an alcoholic/drug addict. I loved my uncle and he was the only person that could resonate and understand what I was going through. But as bad is it sounds, if I didn't want to become like him I need to do what he couldn't, I needed to change.

I have bonded a bit with family and my father now but I'm still alone with no friends, but the loneliness has given me a lot of time to reflect and decide what I want to do and who I want to be. Im no longer depressed and suicidal and I am finally pursuing a dream of mine. 

I'm bettering and focusing on myself everyday, I started gym with my father to get back where I used to but also to get in shape as I'm doing boxing, as my dream is to compete.

So all I'm saying is it's your choice to make being lonely a negative experience. Use this time to reflect and better yourself as that's all you have. Exercise, be healthy, follow a dream, reach out to family, get a hobby, socialise, do something instead of nothing.

Anything is possible, the only limitation is yourself. You cant expect to defeat loneliness with loneliness.",lonely,Just some advice from a lonely guy and my story on how I have been lonely nearly all my life.,2020-09-10 08:18:07

Hey all. 

Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on mobile. As the title suggests, I really don’t understand relationships nowadays.

My dating history is odd, to put it lightly. I dated someone from a different country for three years. We flew to see each other every few months, and for the most part, got on well. I was immature, and not emotionally intelligent in the slightest. That relationship came to a close, with an amicable-ish split. 

My next relationship was a mess. Abusive, manipulative, the works. I would call it the darkest part of my life to be sure. 

Now that I’ve been single for coming on two years, I find myself longing for some form of intimate relationship. I don’t know if that’s what I want right now, but the thoughts are still there. I haven’t gotten a hug in two years. I haven’t held hands with someone for over two years. 

Physical contact makes me anxious, as a result of my last relationship, but it’s what I long for. Talking to people I don’t already know gives me flashes of anxiety and fear. But for some reason, that’s exactly what I want. I want to meet someone new. 

The thing is, I don’t know how to find the things I’m searching for. I don’t know how to approach people. 

I don’t want to approach someone with romantic intentions because, from my experience, that only ends badly. 

I don’t know how to meet people. I don’t know how to approach people I don’t know. This interpersonal shit is hard, and I struggle with these thoughts daily. I’ve always believed that “good things come to those who wait,” but how long do I have to wait?

The point is that I have never had more romantic interactions than holding hands once for 5 minutes. I have never kissed anyone, I never had sex and even though I was in a relationship once, no one I know of has had actual feelings for me.

It’s wrong to think because you love someone more that anything in the world and you’re ready to anything for them just to see them smile , they have to love you back. No it doesn’t work like that. Sometimes no matter how much you love someone, they don’t love you. They don’t need you as much as you need them. You can’t force someone to love you. She just doesn’t want you.  As simple as that. It’s wrong to stick around and make they’re life miserable.  Sometimes loving someone too much means that you have to let them go. Because they’ll be happy that way. They don’t want you. They don’t need you. Why would she want me ? I’m just an idiot. A worthless piece of shit. I’ll never be a real man or her. She did the right think. She’s happy now. I know she is. I love her so much that want her to have anything she wants and I don’t care how much it destroys me. I just want her to be safe and be happy. If she falls in love with another man that’s okay.

it has been 7 months since my mom died I have been living with my brother and his wife, although I am living with two other people it feels like I am all alone like I have no one to talk to and watch movies with as they are always busy with each other which is understandable but whenever i talk about something that i read somewhere, they always ask about the proof as in they have to check if i am lying or not which is quite frustrating cause it feels like they don't have enough faith in me to trust me and now i don't feel confident talking about anything so i have to think a lot before i speak so now i only speak when it is necessary and whenever i talk about my experience they never seem interested with few exceptions. they watch movies all the time and whenever i suggest a good movie they never seem to be interested, once i suggested a movie they were like what kind of movie is that and they watched another movie that night, and after few days my brother came back from office and one of his friends suggested him the same movie, i told them to watch couple days back so that day It felt like that i am nobody, my words and knowledge are nothing i am worthless.

My only friend also 20f has always been there for me, but she got in a serious relationship 6 months ago and has been really only hanging out with her bf, doesn't really try to hang out with me like we used to. Which is fine I'm happy she's in a relationship. I called her on Monday night and was gonna ask to hang out but she said she was at her boyfriend's house and quickly hung up. It made me feel pretty sad and yesterday she called me in the morning but I didn't want to talk and ignored her. She called me again in the afternoon and it was my dads bday so I didn't answer and again that night and I couldn't talk. 

She sent me a text saying if I didn't respond to her asap that she would text my mom making sure i'm alive. That is not word for word but she said it in a threatening way (it was a long well thought out text.) She knows me and my mom don't have the best relationship (I live with my mom). I found it really weird that she threatened to text my mom just because I never called her back, i've gone days almost weeks without talking to her at times and this wasn't even 24 hours of not talking to her. I would never do that to her. 

Everyone has days where they just don't feel right and don't feel like being social and for me it was one of those days. I apologized to her but asked her if she was serious about texting my mom or if she was joking, she hasn't responded so i'm assuming that means she was serious. I am an adult and for her to say things like this really hurts and makes me question if she's even as good of a friend as I thought. I'd rather have no friends than one fake one. I don't know if I'm being irrational or overthinking but this just really weirded me out, she's never acted this controlling before. She does have a tendency to act like more of a parent to me than my friend tho, but this was just next level.

i grew up lonely and isolated, i used to live in my own head as a kid, i was the disposable friend who got left behind whenever a cooler prettier girl came along. pair all that with being autistic, traumatised (not getting into it), moving schools and going through all that AGAIN + quarantine and depression, and youve got the perfect formula for a lonely fucking shut in. 

not to make this a competition but sometimes my girlfriend says she feels like the loneliest person in the world, and shes in a very similar situation to me, but she still has friends. i feel like i cant connect with anyone no matter how hard i try and none of my platonic relationships ever last. the last one crashed and burned and now all i have is a friend i havent seen f2f in a year. 

i just wanna be held. i wish making friends and connections and knowing people and finding the right people was easy. i wish things were easier. i feel like i'm gonna d-e alone and i cant do anything to stop it. everyone leaves me at some point and at this point id rather avoid relationships altogether rather than go through the heartbreak. but i want connections. i want someone to talk to. anyone.

2012,reyeszeno,1599650805,1,"When I first joined reddit, I came here to post because I felt lonely. I don’t know how to describe it. Been alone since 2014. 

This year I tried to make an effort to change my perception of loneliness. Told myself to look at the positives of singlehood. I have a plan; to buy my own place soon. That singlehood brings about fewer commitments. That I’m actually all used to being alone. I made some progress.

But recently the old feelings are starting to creep back in. The dating apps don’t help. Wanted to connect with some that I have genuine attraction and interest for but it wasn’t reciprocated. Which led to me starting to doubt why these girls don’t have any interest in me. I can’t be that bad... right? My other guy friends have none of these issues. They have no issues finding someone who are interested in them too. 

I hate this. I need to dig myself out again and it took a lot from me to but somehow I fell back in recently and I’m just staring back up the well, feeling defeated. While I try to put myself out there to help ppl, sometimes it’s also to help myself. It’s like two hands reaching out to pull each other up together. 

Sometimes, most of the times, I just wanna cry in my bedroom. I just wanna leave and go to another city and start anew. New everything. Start from 0. Because I feel there’s nothing left for me here anymore.",lonely,I thought I was on a new path,2020-09-09 21:26:45

2024,SocialistPunk1985,1599640662,1,"So I’m a 35 year old man, with a Mohawk and one eye. Majority of my life I been lonely, even in the company of say people like my ex wife. It’s crazy but I really do think sometimes I am an alien. I feel so disconnected from other men especially. I am far from perfect, but I know I am a legit good guy.

I’m the cliche, Passionate Aries loud mouth, raised by a single mom, who was emotionally vacant, I mostly been a lone wolf. Always against the grain, and just kinda did my own thing, instead of following a crowd. I joined the military right outta high school, which I have a love/hate relationship with. On one hand glad I proved to myself, I could earn the title of Marine and being honest it mellowed me out a lot, the structure of it. But ultimately, I am too opinionated and question authority so, I wasn’t the best fit in the Marines. Getting injured in an illegal conflict, just plain sucks as well. 

But my attitude is I survived and have a story to tell. So am very talkative at times and other times like my space. I’m very sarcastic and I think that throws people off. Never really knowing what to expect and that’s kinda my thing. But, yea it’s been a few years since I had a real friend or relationship and they just gotten lonelier. Which always blew my mind, because I am loyal, honest and try not to be judge mental. So just kinda irks me how my good karma if such a thing exists hasn’t caught up to me. 

I’m pretty basic. Huge nerd. Reads books, loves cartoons and comics. Love a variety of music, I miss going to concerts and dream of traveling, learning new things and just someone to watch movies with and just chill with. I am a gamer as well, and haven’t had much luck there either. I am pretty open minded to trying new things, would love to learn how to cook, dance, go to a comic con, jump out of a perfectly good air plane, or just take my dog to the park.

I have zero expectations. It’s kinda depressing how cynical I have become at times, but I might be reserved and little guarded at first, but if I like someone I open up. I guess that’s a big focal point for me is trust, and as the adage goes, once you lose it, it’s hard to get back. I am optimistic for someone who’s been thru the ringer and as many tragedies as I have been. I don’t live in the past, I have learned a lot about myself and my resolve, I been done dirty a lot. But I genuinely like myself and believe I deserved better. 

All I can say further is, I think I am different then a lot of men. And in a good way, too. Just never catch a break, and if truth be told, if it means I am alone for the rest of my life, vs becoming more like other guys to get noticed more. Well I have had plenty of practice getting by, mostly by myself. But here’s to hoping that will change.",lonely,35 M Tired of being lonely,2020-09-09 18:37:42

2031,secret-agent-t3,1599630986,1,"So, I am a 26 year old  male and have never been on a date. I'm a virgin, and no girl or woman that I have ever liked has ever reciprocated. I've asked females out before, but have gotten flat rejections every time.

Most days, I am okay. I have been trying to move on in my life, accept I will be alone and try to focus on other things, The pain of the past and the loneliness I feel because of this can be crushing, though. The last woman I really even wanted to ask out rejected me 4 years ago, and I still think about her every day. She was a special person, and it is very hard to accept I may never speak to her again. 

When I first heard the term ""Incels"", I kind of got excited. It was said in a derogatory term, but I was excited because I legitimately thought maybe there was a community of people who felt the pain I felt and I could maybe connect with. However, as I did more research on the subject, that excitement quickly turned to disappointment. This community seems more like a hate group than an actual supportive group. They feed off of grievance and hate instead of pain and connection. 

I wanted to know if anybody had access to a different group or site or something...with people going through what I'm going through. I don't blame the woman that have rejected me...they were all amazing, nice, beautiful people and I honestly wish them well. I want nothing more than for my last crush to be happy with her new boyfriend :)   But having a community that can help me overcome these emotions would be greatly helpful. ""Incels"" have given people like me a bad name...it makes the world view us as self-righteous entitled misogynists.  I want to find the honest, kind men out there who know they have things to work on, that know that woman are not to blame for their situation, and are just trying to move forward with their lives as best as possible.",lonely,A REAL community for men going through my situation?,2020-09-09 15:56:26

I like to think that I'm friendly and relatable. I enjoy doing pretty much everything. 
Before my relationship, I could go up to a group of strangers and have everyone know my name by the end of the night. I had many friends and would invite people to fun parties and camping trips.
Now I just feel lost. I'm awkward and shy, and I don't know how to gain connections where I can invite people to do things with me or get people to invite me to things. This is made worse with covid and me having to move back in with my parents. I live in the Yukon so there isn't a lot of people or groups to join. I'd love to join a group or something, but I can't find any and I'm heavily weighted down with a social anxiety where I'm afraid to even go to a grocery store because I might run into someone and have to talk to them.

Expectation: He would welcome me in-person, we'd meet up and celebrate my move, you know, that kinda thing? He'd check out my apartment and maybe even bring me a house-warming gift (ok maybe that last part is a bit of a wishful thinking). I didn't expect we'd be hanging out all the time because I understand he has other friends or whatever but I thought maybe once in a while and we'd maintain a decent amount of connection.

Reality: I tried to see him but he expressed no interest in seeing me. We just texted a bit after I arrived and then he stopped responding. He has never bothered to contact me for a whole year to ask how I'm doing. I'm capable of looking out for myself, but it would've been nice, considering I'm new and alone here, and especially during these times.

I have known him for a few years mainly through texting/online and we have hung out a couple of times in real life before I moved so we weren't super close but I thought we were pretty good friends. I guess he didn't want to be friends anymore somehow, which is totally fine, I respect it. But yeah, kind of a rough, cold treatment, though. Maybe I was lame and sucked, but I don't think I was that bad of a person/friend enough to deserve that.

And I know that someone might say ""you'll find a better friend for you."" Yeah, I guess, it was just disappointing.

2076,Obydan,1599607419,1,"it's almost 2 weeks that i wake up , eat something then i use a strong drug and then i smoke 15 cigarettes in less than 4 hour.

and i don't see any reason to be awake , i don't even have real memories of being in a relationship. i'm 25 years old and i never had a girlfriend , never kissed or had sex. my best friend left the country 5 years ago , since then i'm completely alone. i didnt leave home for 6 month now.

i have a very creative mind , after 4 hours depression and sadness pull me into bed , i turn of lights and go to bed , then i try to create a false memory , i convince myself that i met a girl before and i close my eyes and recall that never existed memory.

it always starts with me being miserable and depressed af , then some tragedies happen and i end up being lucked in a room with a random girl or in island or in elevator or every person in the world died but me and another girl or i'm dying in nowhere then a girl finds me then i ask her to stay with me till im gone and hear my story then after i tell her my miserable lonely life she would kiss me and i will die.

in these false memories , the only way that makes sense that i can ever be with another girl , is that the girl have no other choice but to be with me otherwise i would know that that girl will never ever accept me.

i have a very powerful brain to emulate and visualize false memories , as i'm recalling these memories , i slowly go into sleep and memory turns into dream, then i fall in love with that girl but she disappears , my dream go wild. i wake up 4 hour later , then i try to sleep again but i can't. then i start a new false memory and i will re-do all the process again and go to sleep.

i sleep for 20 hours in this cycle and then my body needs the drug again , i wake up. i eat , because i should eat so drug can kick in , not because im hungry , i dont feel hunger.

i tried to find girlfriend since i was 18 years old , every time i tried i failed. girls rejected me over and over and every time i got more depressed until last year i stopped. i tried everything but no girl ever liked me , because im thin af and its genetic and i'm poor too. my parents divorced when i was 12 while for 8 years my mom cheated my dad in front of me. i was on the edge of depression i could be revived if only one of those girls would accept me , but they all just rejected me and let me be alone. i failed to be liked over more than 50+ girls , got rejected right in my face over 30+ times and not just random girls in street. girls i knew for more than 2 month in neighborhood , college , university , etc .

i see myself as an animal that lost all fights to alpha males and no female would never accept me , my horns are broken and im flagged as loser and weak member of tribe , a weak gene that supposed to be alone and never reproduce to dont make any weak member again.  

im too scared of darkness, but when depression kicks in , i can even go alone into woods when there is no moon at all and just sleep in middle of complete dark. when I'm strongly sad , fear can't affect me , but i get sleepy. my only hope for life , is this false memories and my imaginary girl friend that appears in my false memories. i don't know how she looks like , its a fade face and i never can recall it.

i learned how to control my dreams with lucid dream technics , but too sad i never can kiss the girl in my dream. she never let me kiss her , maybe because i never experienced it in real life i can't imagine it too.

i have only one wish and one hope in my life , and it's being able to kiss my imaginary girl friend for once.

i just woke up 5 hours ago but i feel sleepy and sad right now , tonight's false memory is that i tried to suicide and jumped over a bridge and i fell under the bridge but didnt died but im about to die in 1 hour , when a girl tries to get selfi on bridge her phone drops right next to me , but she can't see my from that angle , she finds a way under the bridge and when she picks up her phone she sees me. she tries to call emergency but her phone is not working , i tell her i'm already dying and i lost too much blood , please stay with me im scared i didnt wanted this. i thought i will die in 1 sec and it's over , sun goes down and its getting dark. the girl tries to bring some help but the way she used before is now closed by gardeners because its dark now. she yells and cry for help but no one never hear her because sounds of cars and fireworks of valentine celebration.

she comes to me and sit near me and ask me why did i suicide then i tell her that i told myself if i was still alone and virgin in my 40 in valentine day , i will suicide over this bridge ( im 40 in this false memory) and no women ever accepted me and i didnt tried prostitutes.

then she says "" you mean you never kissed a girl?"" "" yes"" i answer. then she tells me that she is married and have a little baby and she was going on a date with her wife. and i would tell her "" don't judge me but for a second i thought you are the one , i thought maybe i survive this and you would be first girl i have ever kissed...\*cough\*.."" then i tell story of my life while im shortening on breath.

then when i feel dizzy and i know that i'm about to die because i lost so much blood i start to cry because i'm scared and i feel like a loser who is going to die virgin right in front of a beautiful girl with the best lips i have ever seen. i ask her "" i'm dying , would you please kiss me...i just wanna know how that feels , just pretend you love and kiss me i wanna know how does it feel to be loved to feels someone's lips on your lips ...\*cough\*..please\*cough\*...

then the girl would say "" i have a wife that i love , i'm sure god will forgive you and you will find your love in heaven"" then she would go on knees and pray for me. and i would say "" please...i dont have time to explain but there is no god or heaven..\*cough\*.. i just want to experience kiss for the first and last time..."" then she cries and gets near me to kiss me , and i'm deeply feeling sleepy and i can't keep my eyes open. i see her lips getting close to my lips i almost feel her breath but i can't keep my eyes open , then i use all my power for the last time to open my eyes and see her. but she is not there, she never been there. i was there all by myself the whole time. i look at the sky i see fireworks with heart shape and i hear people laugh and celebrate from far away as i close my eyes those sounds will slowly reduce till i hear nothing but the sea near bridge and sores. i remember every moment of my life that my parents fought every sad moment of getting rejected , hearing

 "" sorry ""..."" no , please dont follow me again"" , ""even if you were last man on earth..."" , "" you are so thin go find your type kid"" , "" can you believe that guy...she asked me out...haha hahaa haha"" , memories fade , sea background noise would fade and i'm gone.

then i woke up after 18 hours with lots of dreams in between that i can't remember but i remember the girl under the bridge and i tell myself "" maybe she kissed me"".",lonely,I sleep 20 hours per day,2020-09-09 09:23:39
2077,neat-yan,1599607415,1,"Hello reddit. I had an epiphany about the little things in life. Hope this rekindles your soul.

\- **(you can skip this)** *Personal background*. Socially incompetent insecure dude who just gets dumped on one fine sunny day by his only social group of 6 for being unpopular/ reaching out too much. Now all the texts I get (once a week) are out of sympathy, no one actually wants to do anything with the overthinking depressed nerd shit-bag of the school. Friendless for 3+ years now, acting like all is well only for my mum and dad because they are the only ones keeping me alive. For the first few months after the episode with my ""friends"", all my attempts to reach out were mostly ignored/dismissed with statements that made my soul bleed like ""shit happens"", ""its life"", ""deal with it"". People told me that ""depression"" was a word that was thrown around too much, and would be annoyed if I had used it as well. After a while I realised I was passively thinking about suicide. I realised I was most likely mentally unstable, and needed help, and possibly a diagnosis. Oh btw mental health is a stigma here from where I am. :/

\-**(read this)**  I'm very sad most of the time. I had never spoken to anyone other than my parents for 3 months. Sleeping is my favourite part of the day. Yep. I seek escape.

My mom was cooking something and needed some groceries (generally delivered home). I had to go out for the groceries myself as she needed them asap. As soon as I stepped out, I felt sunrays on my skin after quite a while. The sunlight, the breeze, had derailed my monotonous train of thought after ages. It felt good. Nothing spectacular, just nature at work.

I went inside the store, the store owner wished me his greetings, referring to as ""brother/'mi hombre'"". I instantly smiled. Again, felt good. On my way back, the guard smiled at me and asked me how I was. Again, nice feeling.

That was it. Those few moments that seemingly made no difference at all, had made my day! I wasn't sulking for once, and had happy thoughts. 

I realised, we all need some form of *human interaction*. Because at the end of the day, we're *social animals*. that's who we essentially are hardwired to be (according to our DNA at least). 2020 being 2020, human interaction isn't viable at all. I  **strongly** oppose anyone stepping out for any non-essential reasons. 

But remember the sunlight and breeze part? I figured it made me happy, so everyday I tossed my phone and laptop away for a bit, took a chair, placed it to a window and just *sat down.* No more, no less, just me sitting down. Guess what? It worked. I felt happy just sitting down, embracing nature one day at a time. Why you ask? Definitely no human interaction there right? It was because it made me feel as *a part of something bigger than myself.*

\-**TLDR, GETTING HELP IS PRIMARY.** If help is unviable/inaccessible to you, embrace nature however possible, it feels amazing. If you are going out under forced circumstances, make the most of it, practice little acts of kindness. It made my day, will make yours too!! Finally, should any of these methods not work out, I am open to making friends irrespective of who you are, and will try my best to make your day and will be a shoulder to cry on😄.

2091,HAibg,1599598453,1,"I'm  and I've been feeling reaally lonely lately. At elementary school I had 3 friends I thought everything was good and my life was happy. When I went to secondary school/high school (I'm in 3rd year now) or whatever they call it in English none of my friends went to the same class and one of them went to another school. I tried to make a connection to my friend that went to the other school by wishing her happy birthday. We had a little conversation and that was all. I tried because I knew she had common interests. One of the friends that went to the same school, I don't see her that often but at least she says hi to me sometimes. Usually, when I see her she has around 4 friends around her. My other friend that went to the same school just simply ignores me every time she sees me. I've wished her happy birthday and she just said thanks. She's now in the same class as me for 1 year. I've looked in her eyes once and she just immediately looked away like she wished she never met me. I feel betrayed.  


The first 2 friends I made at secondary school/high school just left me and made other friends. 1 of them still talks to me sometimes but I think she's just too kind to say she doesn't want to be friends. After the online classes, I felt like their groups became more solid and there was no place for me anymore. I've tried becoming friends with them but the way they talk to me isn't the way you talk to a friend. Our classes got mixed up after online classes and the only person I could have been friends with went to another class. There was another girl that joined our class and she didn't seem to have any other friends. She just successfully joined a  friend group I tried to join. Before the online classes, I was still a little close but when forming groups I was always last choice. Sometimes I felt like they simply forgot about me. 

Before online classes I sometimes felt sudden optimism telling myself the future is bright and I'll have a great job and a husband etc. But Im starting to doubt that. I think that maybe Im too boring, I don't tell a lot about myself because trust is hard for me. Everytime I told someone something personal I regret it. Ive been kind, patient, loyal, helpful and yet no one wants to be my friend. Im so lonely at school now that I made an imaginary friend. Thats why I hate school.

Sometimes I want everyone from who thought was my friend to die. I think about them dying and I feel like I wouldnt even care.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love my little brother. We have a really good relationship (I think). We play together very often (videogames, stuffed toys). Everytime Im with him I feel hope.

My parents are okay. Sometimes I really love them, but Im a teenager and Im starting to have my own opinion. It causes conflict sometimes. Sometimes I feel like they want to control the way I live too much. When I was small I saw them as higher beings, something I had to obey. Now I see they're human too. I don't tell them about my insecureties and loneliness probably because of how our relationship used to be. But sometimes they really are there when I need them. Theyre still the parents I love and I would be sad if they left me.

Sometimes I wish I never existed, so I wouldnt have to suffer. If I didn't have parents that at least showed a bit of love and such a good brother I might have wanted to commit suicide.

Quick note: I'm well past being convinced that the problem isn't me. 

Before March this year (pre-covid outbreak), it had been over 3 years since I'd been touched by another human being short of handshakes (that I seem to hold on to just a little too long). I've all but begged or paid for affection or attention. I'm extremely self-conscious so, hookups are very hard to agree to. I've been down right depressed thinking that this is what my life has become and, will be until the day I'm no longer here. I've noticed some of my closest friends no longer ""have time"" and, when others make time, I'm often too caught up on how shitty I feel that I'll make an excuse to not be around them. Usually because I genuinely don't want to dull their mood and cause them to not want me around anymore. 

Idk what to do at this point. It pains me daily seeing groups of people together, laughing, holding hands or even just being surrounded by others that seem sincerely happy when I know that I am not. Doesn't help that I've been forced to go back to driving Lyft on the side due to covid ravaging business and my pay being inadequate. So many couples and groups of friends, just happy with and around each other. I'll find myself forcing myself into their conversations just to have someone to talk to. Then, I get all freaked out thinking they're gonna tank my rating because they didn't appreciate it.

2099,ClosedOne,1599588871,1,"People nowadays forgot what word friend is.  


80% of all ""friends"" are companions or something else. Which is different from a friend.  


Friend is a person that gives you attention and affection, kinda like a loved one, but without sexual relationships and marriage. 

This is why we say ""Girlfriend"", and not a ""Girllover"".

Since friendship is close to affection, but without relationships.  
An actual friend won't make to feel lonely, if he/she does, that isn't a friend. Such communicating with a person or doing small activities does make them friends. Especially strangers.

I feel like the reason why people forgot what a true friend is. Is because they forgot what a person's of it's interest expects from them. Also when ever people say it's easy, it's rather they have a low expectation from their friends or they just meant word companion rather than a friend.

Some need friends for affection. Be cute and supportive with them.  
Some need attention to their opinions. Be a good listener to their opinions or ranting.  
Some need a friend to play with. Be active and communicable.   
And etc.

People also have a beliefs that makes it even harder for people to form a bonds.

A dumb belief that if you spend more and more time with a person they will become your friend. People doesn't realize that some just don't stick together and you can't reprogram a person if they already don't care for you.

Another is that ""Friendships isn't a game of expectations"", which is wrong. People need friends not for having them like thing in their dms. Good friends aren't people who don't have expectations from each other. But rather people who know each other so well, that they already do automatically what a person wants, which is a bond.

Sorry could tell more, but knowing that not many people are gonna read it anyway. Plus I am already tired typing.

Hopefully people understood my point. Have a good day.",lonely,"People say they don't have friends, but others tell them it's easy. Lemme correct by my opinions.",2020-09-09 04:14:31

I met my current bf at a conference right before the pandemic hit and had dealt with a barrage of shallow, selfish attention from men who didn't give a shit about me, just wanted my body. I know some of you will be like, ""doesn't count, attention is attention,"" but when you know the people are predatory and you feel unsafe around them and you know you're just an object to them, less than human it's makes you feel even more isolated. 

He was the only good guy I met there. I was his first relationship ever and we're in our mid to late 20s. I've been a serial monogamist since I was 17 and was never really single, mainly to fight the emptiness I felt in the core of my being. It never really went away and I threw myself into being the best partner to people who didn't deserve it. 

He and I started dating soon after but I still felt this emptiness and anxiety. I kept thinking, ""I should just leave him before he realizes how fucked up I am"", nuke it before he gets too close"". I was constantly suicidal and tried to hide that side of myself at all costs. He also went back to rotation 3 weeks away 7 days back work, which made me want to put on a brave face when we chatted.

Through dating him, I realized I had some issues I still had to work through. He wasn't doing anything to provoke these feelings, but I still felt deep feelings of dread, anxiety and mood swings. It was not him, it was me. I realized alot of the loneliness, emotional swings and isolation I felt was because I had undiagnosed bpd. I am diagnosed and starting treatment. I told him about my diagnosis, and my treatment plan and he's supportive.

 I'm in love with him and for the first time in my romantic life, I feel accepted, loved and worthy to be loved. I dont have this pressure and anxiety to smooth over mistreatment, put up with bs and take it because ' I deserve it'. 

You could take alot from this. I know my bf struggled with loneliness and depression. I told him I loved him and he said it back. In our snuggles and whispered sweet nothings after, ""I was beginning to think this would never happen to me"" which broke my heart, and made me so grateful we found each other. I know theres alot of people here who want a relationship badly, I dont want to speak for him but I suspect he was one of them. 

 He dealt with it by working on himself, regularly excercised and ate well, (it's a dopamine dump, I know everyone says it but if you have mental health problems it can make a world of difference, it also worked for me) fostered relationships with long time friends and family, etc. We talked about it, we were super close to crossing paths in 2017 and he said, ""idk if you would've liked me then and vice versa. I'm happy we met now.""

I also have to work on myself and realized I was the type of person to fill the hole in my heart with a person and never address the reason the hole was there in the first place. I'm now doing dbt and working through recovery. 

Theres hope, it gets better and I'm happy he was worth it to look inward and help myself get better for me. Thanks for everything and this sub being here to remind me I'm not alone during my most isolated. ❤",lonely,I'm unsubbing but because I'm on the road to being better.,2020-09-09 03:04:24

I should be happy-

BUT I feel lonely. It’s not like I don’t have friends or colleagues who like me. I am a pretty funny guy and people usually come to me to get some kind of advice. I am 28 now and my life is in order. In the end all this porn I watch and all the girls I talk on here, is worthless. My comments are worthless and I feel worthless. It’s not that I don’t know it. But it’s a substitution for everything at the moment.

I have a couple of dating apps. I also tried „pro versions“ and what not... in the end I had dates, but whenever there was a connection- it was just me. It was never mutual. There was occasionally sex, but that’s it.

I am longing for this deep connection. A person that truely gets me. One that gets upset if I feel worthless and backs me up. Someone I can cry and enjoy life with...

I even got to the point where I thought the reason why I am still single is because I am not in the greatest shape... I am now! But nothing changed. I lost so much weight built so much muscle- I am so close to have a six pack and my stamina has never been this high.

I am a weeb. That should tell you a lot- but you are wrong. I am not like you picture me. I love anime, manga and all that stuff. I don’t have a body pillow- I don’t have any cosplays. I also don’t own any figurines because I think it’s too expensive.

I saved so much money. I am still saving. I plan on buying a house together with my parents, so we can all live together.

I am a soldier. I serve my country. There was a time where I have not seen my mum or dad for months and that repeatedly. We were lucky if I made it twice a year.

This feels like I am ranting... and I don’t even want to. I just feel hurt for some reason. I don’t want to write too many details about me, because I don’t want to reveal everything about me.

Let’s just say I am not looking for anyone to cheer me up. I know that I am still young and life sometimes takes wierd turns. But I just wanted to get this out if my brain.

**(READ HERE IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE BACKSTORY)** So growing up in a very close minded, poor-ish, country, all i want since i was 13 is to study abroad and live somewhere far where the people are more accepting, the education is much better, and you can do lots of things without having people think of you as a disgrace or stuffs. So I've been planning to go to college in this country as the opening gate to live there in the future, but after doing an intense research and joining lots of forums, seminars, and workshops, i'm starting to realise it's basically impossible to get a full-funded scholarship in this country unless i, i dont know, be a volunteer in sweden or somewhere ive never heard before for like 3 years straight.

**(START HERE IF YOU REALLY CANT BE BOTHERED)** It's hard for me to grasp the fact that my long-time dream (to study, live and spend my early 20s in this country) is basically gone out of the window solely cause i'm limited by money. everything costs something and even though i'm pretty wealthy and bright compared to my friends here, my parents just simply cant afford to pay all of this. To be honest my main goal is to get a citizenship and move out, but i thought i can get to know this said country a bit better by studying there and learn its culture first. Now with the ""studying"" part being gone, i dont know how the hell am i gonna try to apply for a citizenship there. I dont know a single thing about that place besides for the fact that it's a lovely place to live in. I know i'm only a highschooler and that life has just begun for me but i feel so sad and angry knowing that im probably gonna be stuck here in this bigoted country for the rest of my life.

&gt;! maybe it's time for me to let go of this dream of moving out... but letting go of my dream means that i have to suffer for the rest of my life living in a place i dont want to be in, stuck in the tradition ive always hated, and having to see my children grow up dealing with so much hatred or being a hater themselves from having their heads filled with people's nonsense.!&lt;

i know this shit makes no sense but trust me it breaks not just my heart, but all of my hopes and dreams knowing i'll never get to experience the simplest young adult stuffs like going to parties, getting drunk, or just make out with someone and celebrate my youth to the fullest solely because im stuck here in this place.

I put everything I had to give into our friendship and I wasn’t good enough. The thoughts .... they have me second guessing why I’m even here. It’s just too painful. Deep down... I love her more than anything else in the world and she’s gone. She brought joy and purpose into my life again even by just having random conversations. Our emotional connection was unlike no other.

Everything I do I get reminded of her. I cannot watch YouTube to distract myself because all I can think about is sharing videos with her. I am stuck in my own mind and I’m not sure how much more I can take of this torture. 

I am trying my best to honor her wishes of us not talking anymore; and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. I put my trust in her and it became too much. Even if I were able to say “hi” and saw that she read it.... I likely wouldn’t be in this state of mind- not this deep at least. 

I miss her so much. Life is torturous right now, and I relied on her for her support and ability to calm me down. When my life was falling apart already... she left.

2150,gettinglonely1234,1599539943,1," 

Just wanting to get something off my chest because I can't really talk about this openly with my friend group.

Six  months ago I ended a long term relationship.  It ended on good terms  and there's no hard feelings there but it was a dead bedroom for the  last couple years. Now that I am back to being single and living alone I  am acutely missing close contact with the opposite sex.  Always in the  past when I was free I had options to fill that need.  Sometimes it was  with an Ex, or a FWB.  The last time I was single Craigslist was an  option to have a casual encounter and I made use of it to some success  that also often lead to FWB.

Now I  find myself in a world where finding casual contact is practically is  not an option.  I never was good at finding a partner at the bar but  with my present age and a pandemic that option is out.  Craigslist  casual section was shutdown and there seems to be no real replacement.  I  live in a lower population town now and the dating sites have less than  12 profiles and all are looking for long term, which is not something I  am ready for yet.

So I find myself seriously looking at an option I never have before.  An escort...

Now  I am very aware of how that industry is rife with exploitation and  addiction which is why I have never done anything like that.  But times  have changed and my country has different laws now to help with those  issues.  I am also a big believer that people should be allowed to do  what they want with their bodies and if you choose to do sex work then  that is OK, it's your choice.

Never  the less I am hesitant to go down that road, but if I am to see to my  needs I don't really see any other option.  Pandemics suck...

I am not sure what I am looking for right now other than to get my thoughts out there and see what, if anything, comes back.

I was very anxious, and I was very depressed that I felt like I was a 'failure' because I found it hard to keep friends, and that I was never in a relationship. I kept feeling like this loser who wallowed in self-pity and would die a virgin. I've seen countless of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and none was able to help me. I was stuck in this rut, and then, I became an uncle.

My whole life changed, and I discovered that I had a purpose, to help this child in any way possible and to be there for them, whenever they needed it. My outlook changed and I got to that age where I realized that this is who I am.

I also realized that I would probably be a bad boyfriend after a while. I don't like going out too much. I like watching my favorite shows as they air. I would likely get jealous at any guy who would talk to her.  I didn't see a happy ending. So for the good of everyone, I might as well take myself out of the equation.

I have always had problems keeping friends. I have a close friend, but she is married and has a kid, so it gets harder and harder to catch up. I have some co-workers that I am friends with, but we don't do anything outside the office other than a dinner once or twice a year. I have been okay with this. After a long week at work, I am good with using the weekend to recharge my batteries.

Im a 25 year old, living by myself, no job, no degree or training experience in anything, waiting to pick up school to start on my associates in accounting.

I dont really have friends. I know people but at my age and theirs, I rarely hear from anyone these days because of their jobs or their own families. Even when i was working briefly nobody ever came near me or talked to me, except in brief passing.

Even for events i go to involving my faith and get invited to, people avoid me or have no idea what to say to me. Its like im some sort of plague. Even my family avoids m, except my mom who (sigh)...still takes care of my finances until im done with school...(embarressing is not even the right word to say about how i feel about saying that)

2195,dahtrowaweigh,1599510825,1,"Throwaway account.  Early 30's straight male.

I have been single for quite a few years now, in one noteworthy relationship that lasted about as long.  I was sitting here thinking about why the last couple of women I tried to talk to these past few years never took any romantic or sexual interest in me, and why many of them barely even saw me as a friend.

I wanted to dedicate a quick paragraph to a few standout women and ask for feedback on where I'm going wrong here, and see if anyone thinks I should get back in touch with any of them, or give advice on the kind of women you think I would be better-suited to try meeting?  Maybe part of the problem is I still don't know who is a good match for me, even if I do know of some things I want to avoid now.

The Five Girls will be referred to as M, D, T, K and E.

M: Met online over a decade ago.  She was never interested but I was infatuated with her.  She seemed to care more than a lot of other people I met, but perhaps due to disabilities and disorders seemed self-centered in her interests and only wanted to talk about things she was interested in outside of personal advice.  She met someone else a long time ago, and I accept that, but still wonder why I was never given consideration.

D: To date the most attractive person I have gotten to ""date"".  She seemed shallow and I think she is untrustworthy and a little bit unhinged, but she at least acts concerned for other people.  I think she doesn't want to work and is a gold-digger, looking for someone who can take care of her while she ignores her own issues and focuses on world issues.  I think she found me too boring and wanted someone who would pay for her bills, but I'm not sure why she didn't want to settle down before she met me, but after she met me she was all for it with the very next guy.

T: I have thought about contacting T again.  I have never met T before in person, but I live pretty close to her and have brought up hanging out with her in the past.  That came close to happening one time, but she seemed disinterested in hanging out and decided against it because she was tired when the day arrived.  She takes tons of pictures of herself and seems to have body image issues, and just seems kind of stuck in her own world, unwilling to get to know someone new from the outside who might have some things in common with her.  When the subject came up before she seemed to be looking for a particular type of guy.

K: I worked with K.  She seemed to want to talk to me and after a few months we were working beside each other.  I think her upbringing was a little rough at times and her mother's lifestyle greatly influenced hers.  She seemed really flighty.  I never came right out and expressed interest in her but she gradually came to spend more time with me...just at a distance.  I don't know if she was totally annoyed by me or if there was any sort of connection forming.  But after we had a falling-out one day she quit and instantly moved away to another state.

E: I came across E on a dating app.  She was difficult to get in contact with, but eventually she responded - a little.  She is definitely a real person and takes a lot of pictures on the job.  I'm still confused about why she never wanted to get to know me - we live pretty close and she seems to have common interests.  It might be a personality thing, or maybe she just has a lot of friends?  She doesn't seem easy to talk to, but I still occasionally wonder why a seemingly good match is so awkward to try to communicate with.

I still don't think the issue is that I am not taking enough initiative.  Even though I am kind of quiet, I feel like I have done most of the work to get in touch with these women.  The only exception might be K, who I think I sensed shared a curiousness in me.  Otherwise a few people on this list I made an effort to get back in touch with after much time had passed, and I don't feel they ever did the same.

I can understand where D was a bad match for me, and honestly I probably liked her most for her looks.  I feel like I'm a fairly open-minded guy, so I'm not sure why none of the others wanted to get to know me better.

I'm expected by everyone around me in my ""bubble"" to get into a serious relationship and get married soon - yet I need to find a ""good Christian girl"" which is basically near impossible (ADD TO THAT COVID making it harder to meet anyone new!! 😠) 
Everytime I meet someone intriguing and we hit it off, my conscience tells me ""oh she's not what you're looking for..."" ""No one will approve of her"" etc... So I don't even bother pursuing a relationship any further

There's been so many times in my life when I could've been in a relationship had I dissolved my beliefs and standards... But I just can't, like emotionally, mentally, spiritually, even physically I can't abandon it.
At the club before covid earlier this year, when a girl tried to kiss me I literally made up a dumb excuse and ran away because I felt so guilty... Even though I feel so affectionately starved 😔

I've saved myself for someone special my whole life, I've never kissed a girl or anything else, despite (I confess) being wild back then in HS and first years of uni. Don't get me wrong, my head/heart wanted attention so badly but whenever it came to me by the ""wrong type"" of girl (aka non-christians...) I would push it away, despite wanting it so badly...

And the worst is... NO ONE has made me feel like ""I NEED to have that person in my life one day, she's amazing"" and I'm losing hope that I'll ever meet someone like that...

Yet the amount of times I've been hurt/led on by ""good"" girls has been too much to count... Like these are the ""good girls""?!? Yet they play me and hurt me like that? Get outta here man... It's not fair

2252,TommySnafu,1599465006,1,"Not sure why I am writing this but here it goes.

I feel like to understand my situation I need to add the context of how I ended up with literally no friends. I am a 17 yo male. When I went into high school I really had two best ""friends"", a handful of school friends that i sort of knew, and two online friends who were only a year older then me, but I was really close with them. 

9th grade was okay for me but my ""friendship"" with my two best friends, Which had always been slightly toxic looking back on it, turned sour and they would constantly tease me for various things like my weight, the size of my forehead, the clothes I wore, the food I got, and would call me names like school shooter because I had long hair at the time. This hurt my feelings, but I always felt like It was me who just couldn't take a joke so I stayed friends with them all the way through the school year. 

During the summer of 9th grade I went through some serious stuff and almost died resulting with me having very serious PTSD.  

Enter the beginning of 10th grade. Because of how lunches were scheduled I didn't have my two best pals! in the same lunch, so the teasing wasn't a huge problem, but it was still definitely there. This was the same year all of my grade started getting into weed. I personally don't care if you smoke weed, however it was never and will never be something I am interested in, but my only two friends had a different opinion and started smoking weed almost every day. This ended in them saying that I was boring and slowly but surely they stopped inviting me to hang out and go places with them.

I went into the second trimester of 10th grade with literally zero actual friends at school, and because of the size of my school the different clicks were too tight to join, and trust me I tried. At the end of the day the PTSD I was dealing with left me feeling that everything I was doing in school and life was completely useless, and I honestly could not relate to anyone in my school because the way I was feeling and the event that I had gone through completely changed me. Once I had realized this I went through two months of dealing with the goddamn PTSD every day and night, literally going entire days without talking to anyone, eating by myself at a lunch table while I could see my old ""friends"" having a fantastic time, and feeling a sense of loneliness I could have never dreamed existed. It really got to the point where I can honestly say I might have attempted to kill myself if it weren't for the fact that I couldn't put my father through that pain. 

This persisted until one day I literally felt the accumulative weight of feeling like this, and getting 4 hours of sleep per night, snap and had a mental break down.

Shortly after this I made the decision to leave my high school and do online school. This was one of the best decisions of my life and led to me being a generally happier person, it allowed me to mentally heal and deal with the worst parts of my PTSD, it improved almost every aspect of my life by miles, and because of my schools trimesters I had enough credits to graduate a year early. There was one issue with online school and that was the social aspect of it. After I left my High school the only social interaction I had outside of my family was my two online friends. At the time I felt this was fine because in my head I could just act like these online friends were the equivalent of real life friends.

Skip to today and I have graduated high school by some miracle, I am now fully perusing flying as my future, and I enjoy life... BUT as all good things do this also comes with a catch. Back in May one of my online friends slowly stopped responding to my messages and stopped getting on after 4 years of talking to him on the internet. The other online friend and I still got on but that too faded out without having our other friend there. I now literally have no friends at all and no one to talk to this about. The closest thing to a friend I have is my Dad. The vast majority of my days are spent either studying about flying or flying, and this used to be okay because I could always hop on and talk to my online friends about stuff, but now not so much. I would love to try and go find groups of people to meet and hang out with, but not only is everything in lock down I literally do not have the time because of the amount of shit you have to do and know to get your commercial pilots licences. I guess its my fault though because I should not have blurred the lines between online friends and real life friends, but hey lesson learned. I guess im just looking for some suggestions on where to meet people as a 17 year old who doesn't have a lot of free time. Its not like there is any clubs or places I could go and everyone at the airports that I meet are two or three times my age. I also know this isn't forever and maybe I should stop bitching and deal with it for a year then meet people at college, but my social skills are probably pretty bad all things considered. I guess I'm just venting and maybe typing the shit I constantly think about will help, but who knows. I don't even care about girls and sex I Just want some actual friends with similar interests to pass the time with because being this lonely fucking sucks man. Jesus.

I was so so very lonely before and now I will be again but it’ll be so much worse this time. She had so many friends who she introduced me to and it made feel like I actually had a social group and life. 

Now I have nothing. 

Now I’m just a man in his 40’s sobbing at his moms house because he can’t face going back to a shitty little flat. 

This was my first serious relationship after my last partner died. I was so happy and proud and told everyone where I work and put it all over Instagram and now I’ll just have to say I failed again.

This may sound weird. So, please don't judge. I just need an honest person's perspective. Every time I see a beautiful girl I feel lonely. I know why I am lonely. I'm 20 years old who have never had a single relationship, never had sex, or have been kissed. I also feel like I am... Just different compared to people my age. I don't like partying or drinking because of personal reasons, but I don't hate people who like to drink socially or have a beer with dinner. I love anything outdoors like hiking, fishing, etc., but I don't know anybody to go out and enjoy those things with so, in return I just isolate myself by focusing on school work.

Anyways, I always smile and blush when I see a beautiful girl, but then I get feelings of loneliness. In my head, I want to walk up and talk to anybody and spark up a conversation, but I just say forget it and I don't say anything. When I'm having a conversation with someone, sometimes I think of saying something that might carry the conversation, but I don't say it. Then after I always look back on how I could have contributed even more to the conversation. So, In my head, I create multiple scenarios of dialogue between me and whom I had the conversation with. At the end of the day, when I do that it just makes me feel even more lonely. I love my life I couldn't be more satisfied where I am going, but when it comes to relationships I just don't know.

Also, when I'm at college, restaurant, etc., I noticed that sometimes I get stared at by girls. Not every girl, but some. My mom sometimes will say ""they might think your good looking"". I mean if they do hypothetically, why don't they say that or try to converse with me instead of staring at me like a deer in the headlights because to me that makes me feel uncomfortable because I don't know how to interpret the message.

2276,throwaway_needtorant,1599450063,1,"Like the title states.

I've fallen completely head over heels in love with this guy. It's the most love and warmth I've ever felt for someone. I didn't know my heart could be so open. We would talk about anything for any amount of time. There is so much we have in common. He is everything I've ever wanted. I would abandon my entire lunch hour, just to spend my time with him.

But I never made my move.

I knew he was leaving the country by September. So, the three months that I had with him, I tried to get as close as I could with him without actually putting any sort of label on things. I knew my heart was going to hurt, and getting any closer with him was going to hurt it more. And so... we're just really close friends. I still don't even know what he truly thinks of me.

And now, the time has come. He will be leaving in three days, to a new country to start on his lifelong dream. The exact dream I have as well, but I chose a different path and so we must fork our different ways. I'm stuck here, and he will be in a new country. I'll likely still be where I am, if he ever comes back, even just for a visit. But he will be living his best life.

I just wish I could go with him. To be closer to him. I could honestly see myself marrying this man - he is all that I've ever dreamed about. He's the first person I've ever been completely open to, about myself. And I just feel like my true self when I'm around him. But alas, it wasn't meant to be. I just imagine myself every night, cuddled up next to him. It's not even lust with him....it's a pure yearning for his love. He's so pure and wholesome. I know he would treat me with his entire heart, and never hurt me. He's just a perfect gentleman.

I dread these three days, as I count them down. But also will be holding them dear, since they will be the last days I have with him. I'm going to be lost without him, but will just have to find my way again. I likely will never see him again in my life. Even if he does come back to visit his family, there's no way he'd stop to visit me, I don't think since we weren't ever actually a thing. So, I know that on that third day, I will say goodbye and that will be the last of it. I'm going to try and at least get a hug goodbye from him, then this door will close in my life for good.

I won't be alone forever. There is someone out there for me. It's just not my time yet. I hope he finds an amazing girl over there, one that also shares his dream and he and her can complete it together. I hope only the best for him.

I'll remain here, sad and alone. But he deserves only the best.

I will be making him a special card and a cake as a goodbye. I'm not sure what I'll write in the card, but I'm thinking maybe I'll write a hint towards my true feelings towards him. Not that it will matter at that point, but that way he has a chance to reciprocate and tell me back or to leave and not have to make anything awkward if he doesn't feel the way I do.

Any ideas on what to write in the card without being too straight forward would be appreciated. Thanks for listening. You'll find someone out there for you.

2281,GreenMtnDabber,1599446444,1,"Look, I'm not the kind of person to sit here and trash myself all day long. I used to be that guy, but in recovering from depression I learned to argue with and eventually drown out most of that hateful, judgemental voice in my head. But what I can't argue with are hard facts, and I don't believe it's healthy to walk around under the delusion that there's a likely enough chance of finding love to even consider it a real possibility.

I feel like waiting for love is like waiting to win the powerball. Sure, it MIGHT happen. Among 8 billion people I'm sure there's at least SOMEONE who might be interested in connecting with me and sharing ourselves with each other. But what's the point of hoping you'll find a needle in a haystack, LET ALONE searching for it?

Some people can, through hard work, change their behavior enough to satisfy the wants and needs of friends or romantic partners. I'm sure that I could to. But while I don't want to sound as if I don't think I have any room to improve, I also just...don't want to learn to ignore and hide who I am to satisfy what another person expects of me. I suppose if that's where a lot of people are coming from, it makes sense as a two-way contract; you be what I want and I'll be what you want. But it just seems so shallow to me. So egotistical. So obviously about satisfying the self instead of appreciating another. 

I feel fundamentally different and intrinsically unable to connect with most people I encounter, and a number of really awful and traumatizing early relationship experiences left me with some really awful trust issues and PTSD surrounding social situations and particularly romance. I occasionally have panic attacks when it feels like I'm getting too close to someone because I sense that I'm becoming vulnerable. I try to tell myself I don't know what the other person thinks or how they feel, and I try to fight against and push back the anxiety, but time and time again, once someone gets to know me well enough or finds someone better? I'm suddenly left on read by intimate partners, ghosted by plutonic friends of years and years, told I mean nothing to people I care deeply about. Lured in with a facade of interest in intimacy, used for sex, and then forgotten about. Again and again and again. So how am I supposed to tell myself this isn't always going to happen?

At the start I said I wasn't going to trash myself like I used to, and that's true, but I sense an internal duality in my thinking that leaves me feeling deeply ambivalent toward myself. On the one hand, there is a lot about myself I appreciate and admire. Without sounding conceited, I have a lot of things going for me; decent skills and a range of abilities, a good brain and a big heart, among other things. 

But looming over that is my truly crippling neuroticism which ultimately colors every aspect of my experience. My genuine appreciation for myself, when filtered through the lense of my deep seated self-dissatisfaction and terror at the though of being judged or rejected by literally anyone, manifests in vulnerable-narcissistic traits. My awareness of my flaws and shortcomings when viewed through the same is distorted into sheer hatred, cruel and viscious beyond belief. I'm not going to trash myself, but I'm a MESS of flaws. Which is a big part of why I've concluded that I am better off focusing on learning how to effectively be alone, whatever that entails.

So basically, every seriously meaningful relationship is bound to end in gut-wrenching, life-ruining pain and suffering, whether through death, rejection, deceit, etc. Not to mention that even FINDING said relationship in the first place is, at least for me, about as likely as getting struck by lightning. And much like getting struck by lightning, sure, I could definitely put myself in situations that greatly increase my risk of being struck, but that begs the question: why in the FUCK would I want to get struck by lightning?

Through experience I have learned that I'm at my best when I'm totally alone. My thoughts are clearer. My actions and intentions are more centered in logic rather than emotion. My impulsive nature is drastically reduced, allowing me to better able control my various addictive and unhealthy behaviors. I get better sleep. I lose weight. I focus more on my future. My self-esteem improves until my ego starts to go away. But as soon as I reconnect with ANYONE, it all slips away. I become a miserable, neurotic mess. I can never offer anyone anything but an arrogant and callous rejection of everything they think has meaning. I slowly ruin every relationship from the inside, until I'm essentially holding the other person hostage and leaving them no other options but either a) sever the connection or b) allow themselves to be subjected to the misery that is sharing my company without considering how THEY feel. 

So no matter what, I ultimately end up walking away from every relationship or connection I ever forge full of bitterness, judgement and hurt toward them and disgust, shame and hatred towards myself. Every time I connect with anybody, I rediscover the crushing reality that the best thing I can ever do for the people I love is leave them the fuck alone. And no matter how similar I am to people, no matter how close of a match we are, they will eventually discover that one single thing inside me that rubs them the wrong way, and that will render me valueless to them. 

Because a human relationship isn't a connection based on a shared appreciation for each other's respective consciousnesses, apparently it's just a transactional contract most of us dumb, gross upright apes enter into to manipulate and take advantage of one-another in a way that's slightly more sustainable than the standard raping and pillaging. I mean, the fact that there are people I've known for YEARS who I love dearly from the bottom of my heart, whose opinions of and thoughts about me would suddenly and drastically change if the dynamic of our relationship changed...it just makes me sick. Isn't my love supposed to be about YOU??? Who YOU are, not who you are to ME??? I mean shit, I'm supposed to be the egotist here! 

Fuck me for wanting something deeper I guess. Fuck me for being someone who can't help but see the bigger picture in life, and for always being the one to shatter people's dreams. You don't think my dreams are shattered? You don't think I wish I had a better answer for you? Do you think it would be anything short of torture for me to watch someone I love so deeply wasting the last dregs of their life and energy chasing a false hope down a wrong path when I KNOW BETTER? But people would rather be lied to and talked down to than told a harsh truth. They would rather be coddled and deceived ""to spare their feelings"" than treated like an equal, and the irony is that when I DO treat people like equals, they feel talked down to and get upset. But I refuse to cater to their silly whims, because it feels gut wrenchingly wrong to do so. I won't lie to myself, and I HATE myself, so why should I lie to someone I love with all my heart, or even someone I'm indifferent toward?

So I can't share my thoughts and feelings, not just because people aren't interested in hearing them but because I'm terrified of the millions and millions of people who would hate me for simply seeing the world a little differently than they do; for having a little bit of extra love in my heart and fear in my mind. I'm not crazy (I've been tested) and I'm not in it to hurt anybody. Quite the opposite, in fact; for my entire life, I've felt an unshakable, unwavering conviction that my purpose in life is to help people. But after soending almost a quarter of my life trying not to drown in the overwhelming suffering of the world, I just can't do it any more. I hurt people by trying to hurt them, and in doing so I also hurt myself, and they hurt me, and they hurt themselves, and at the end of the day all I've done is create more suffering.

The final reason I'm pretty committed to never opening myself up to the possibility of a relationship again is my view on the world, which is bound to rub lots of people the wrong way. I can see the future, to a certain extent; I know what will come to pass over the next centuries and millennia. Not in detail, but the basic gist of it? Yeah.

I know; sounds like something a crazy person would say. But I'm right. And by the time people are ready to admit I was right, I'll either have moved on metaphorically onto the next stage of my life or literally into a worm's belly 6ft under ground, so it won't matter. The best I ever get is some sad, twisted validation after the point of no return has long since passed or I've lost the energy to care anymore. And it comes in the form of people I love saying ""you were right, I am now suffering"" or ""you were right, that suffering was avoidable."" It's not exactly that I feel responsible, but my heart just aches for people. 

It actually hurts so bad that I used to resort to a few different forms of self-harming to distract myself from it, and to this day I have what's called onychotillomania, meaning that I compulsively rip away at my fingernails until they're a bloody disgusting deformed mess. I actually tear some of my nails clean off a few times every couple years or so, because apparently being literally tortured hurts less than seeing a friend going through a tough time. 

I toss and turn in my sleep every night and can only see the worst possible outcomes of every scenario. I'm always 20 steps ahead into what might go wrong, which is exhausting for me and totally unbearable for the people around me. I'm SO insecure, and insecurity being just about the biggest turn-off in the entire universe, it doesn't matter that I'm 6'2"" with a decent frame, a moderately attractive face and plenty to work with in the pants department. It doesn't matter how much I try to be a kinder more compassionate person, or how much effort I put into overcoming my bullshit. There are simply some core traits of my personality which I am a) unwilling to lie about or hide to get what I want out of people when I genuinely love most everyone for who they are, NO MATTER who they are, and b) completely unable to change even if I was willing, and the unfortunate reality is that these traits are not only dealbreakers for the vast, vast majority of people, but they're also inherently destructive to relationships.

So, now that I'm 23 and all my hopes and dreams are dead; I have given up hope on changing the world, on humanity, on the future, on finding love, and even on myself; I begin to settle into my next task in life: to saddle myself. First, I must wait until my spirit breaks. Then I must treat myself like an animal by maintaining a strict routine of diet, exercise, mandatory but limited socialization, etc. etc. I've learned that what I want is inherently destructive, and so I must consider what I NEED. 

I do not need to be validated by another person to know I deserve to feel happy in myself and my life. I do not need distracting, destructive vices like junk food or alcohol (although I'll admit to being a hopeless cannabis addict and have no intention of ever quitting) to get myself through, nor do I need connection. What I need instead is reflection. And maybe given enough time I'll reach some sort of inner peace.

Considering the story of Siddhartha Gautama, I see parallels between my life so far and the beginning if his story. Born into unimaginable wealth and opulence (America being the wealthiest nation in history and there being studies to suggest that ""wealth"" after a certain point causes nothing but steess unless measured through things like life satisfaction, emotional connection with loved ones, stability of home relationships, etc. has convinced me that I'm one of the most fortunate human beings to have ever lived) and then thrust into unimaginable injustice and suffering, I desperately search for meaning or connection. Something to tell me I'm not alone. Something to convince me I'm not in hell. How do I escape this suffering? Unlike the Buddha, who, although probably no more enlightened than any of us but simply very practiced in regulating and being at peace with his thoughts and emotions, has touched the hearts and minds of countless people with his wisdom, I just cower in the corner, wallow in my own sadness and filth, scream out in childish resentment at the blind, deaf and dispassionate universe for leaving me alone with such a cruel and empty fate. Clearly, I am no Buddha. I am nobody.

So, for all those of you who are alone out there, I'm sorry I can't reach out to you. God damn do I want to...there's nothing more in the world that I want than to be able to do that. But I can't, and if I know what's good for me (and you), I never will. But just know that somewhere out there, there's a weird freak who has never met you but already loves you. Yes, you. Your flaws. Your mistakes. Your hopes and your triumphs. Your ugliness as well as your beauty. I don't care who you are, where you've been, what you look like, what you have beetween your legs, what you believe, what you've fucking done or whether you regret it at all. I LOVE YOU, with every fiber of my being. You are a beautiful, incredible creature and I wish to know you DESPERATELY. But all I can do is admire us all from afar, beautiful little walking disasters that we are...so, at least hear my words: ""unconditional love"" is a REDUNDANT PHRASE. If it's not unconditional? It AIN'T LOVE. Can you cut off a loved one for your own or their health? Of course! But do you all really just stop loving each other because of some meaningless little detail or another? Because of how it relates to YOU? Gross. Gross, gross, gross. 

Well, that's about all I have to say. It's probably a rambling, disjointed, nonsensical trainwreck, but oh well it was more for me than it was for any of you, anyways. Fuck you all. I say that with nothing but love, of course. Sometimes we need to hear it.

I leave you with a shitty lyric from a druggie jam-band that just about sums up how I feel right now and pretty much all the time: ""I can see the future, I can see the stars. You can see what you see...because you are who you are.""",lonely,I (23m) am already completely resigned to being alone for the rest of my life (LONG RANT),2020-09-07 12:40:44

My now stepfather also isn't there for me. Since birth, I couldn't connect with anyone because nobody told me how to do it. I was bullied in kindergarden, school and freetime.

Friends I got mostly either used me or just left me alone, how could I possibly understand with 4-6 years that in a resort people wouldn't stay for long. 

I went this way for several years, the first time I got to actually trust someone was with my first girlfriend. Guess what happened? I was overwhelmed with the fear I could lose her. I cried nearly every night, craved her warmth and her smile. But we were too young, even though I craved something for the long run, she didnt.

After that, the loneliness that I only got a glimpse of inside of me exploded. I needed 3 years to get over it. 

After all these years, after all this pain, this.. blood and tears.. there's just one simple thing that I want. It's so simple but so far away. Love. Okay I get it, it may seem simple to me after thinking about it for years but still, there's nothing I want more.

A smile that belongs to me, a kiss to start the day, a cuddle to keep the depression at bay.

I believe in chivalry, love, connections and soulmates even though I haven't had the pleasure to experince it. I continue to search for that person who will hug me, kiss me, hold my hand and tell me everything is going to be alright. That they get me, they understand my pain and are willing to give themselves  to me 100% and I will do the same. 

Sure I have loved, have had children that love me, are happy but don't know anything about my childhood pain, suffering and how my smiles are simply masks that shield their happiness  and hide my loliness and the fact I cry myself to sleep every night. People like me, I make them laugh, and believe I'm normal. It's all just an act, a facade. I hate most people even though most love me. Things happened in my childhood that I conceal from my family to save them from the pain. I feel so alone, living this life to make people around me happy, forever hiding my cries behind a mask of happiness.

I beg for distance when I'm mad

And if it's best for you, then go be free

Too scared of bein' alone

To heal my broken soul*

2310,DefinatelyNotLasso,1599427307,1,"if you wanna waste/kill some time then you might go ahead and read what I have to say.

33 years old from Germany, I excuse myseld already for any grammar mistakes. God where to I start it's just so f*cked up. Well I've always been BMI 40+ even at age 10 already. Single mum raising her only child. Had to work a lot so I was alone. Probably started eating to cope that feeling. I wasn't really bullied but I was pretty much weird shy, like really awkward. I didn't care about my future because I was doomed anyway. Realised I will die young so I had no drive to build up a nice future. I simply didn't care.

Age 26 I developed heart issues. A few months later I went to the hospital as I couldn't take it any more. Had high blood pressure, pre diabetic, heart arrhythmia, hypertensive crisis, atrial fibrilllation and god knows what else. Doc said 2-3 more years. I didn't wanna suffer during that time. Suicide was no option. I somehow still realised life's too valuable also I had no option basically to do it without disturb any other human beings. So I actually pulled it off and lost 220lbs in round about 2-3 years. And that only happened because I was literally going through hell. I was bed bound for like 40% of that time, pissing in bottles, fighting to somehow get to the toilet. Standing up was impossible as my heart would literally jump ouf ot my chest. You won't be able to imagine what it was like.

Anyway, I hit ~280lbs and my health was okish. From time to time it was really bad but not crazy bad. But suddenly it got worse. Back in hospital they couldn't find a reason. I got released in basically the exact same condition like 3 days later. Man that experience though, to this date I don't get it. Anyway, I kept putting on weight again. Funnily enough everything was better while I was slowly gaining weight until a point where I felt the additional weight again. I should have died in nov. 2018. Had diabetes typ 2 but was untreated and still ate many sweets every day. Or like a whole cake worth 4k cals in an hour. I was binge eating every day for a good 3 months already. Somewhere between 5-10k cals a day.

2019 I weighed 430lbs. Life was literally not worth it. I got lucky I guess that all the things aligned one day on jan 12th. It clicked for me somehow. I changed again. Lost 80lbs in the following 3 months. Stagnated, lost some more, regained some from binge eating, lost some more, stagnated, regained from binge eating until I hit &lt;220lbs. Right now I'm lik 212lbs or so. 

Until now you would think damn that's great. And yea it is. But man I'm an idiot still, yea an idiot who has gotten himself a 2nd chance. But still everything feels so bad. Here you usually start college at around 18 or 19 years old. So I would be at a level of a 18/19 year old. On top though I've gotten kind of old, I'm in dept as I didn't care about my life for almost all my life, I've literally had 3 different pairs of shoes throughout my whole adult life and the third pair I'm actually wearing right now! My mobile phone is from 2009, a samsung galaxy i7000. I still have SMS messages from 2009, can you believe that? I don't have whatsapp and all that as my phone doesn't support that. 

I'm a virgin, I've never dated someone, I have literally no experience with the other sex. Obviously I suffer from various kind of mental deseases. Never seen a doc, I also lost the weight all by myself as I simply can't accept help. It's just too hard. I don't think I'm worth it to accept help and I'm completely aware. I know that I can get out of this whole by mself, but it will take a lot longer than if I were to ask for help. 

Up until that point everything is clear. I don't really have any people to open up too. I have friends, good friends and some know how hard my situation is but no one knows how hard and tough it really is. All the people that haven't seen me in ages congratulate me on my weight loss and I can appreciate that. It's honestly nice and feels good. But at the same time I think yea so I have literally wasted at least 15 years, I'm in dept, still with my mum, can't afford nothing (I do work at minimum wage - 400$ a month round about, half of it goes into health insurence so I basically got nothing left). 

I still have this self image of being obese, feel judged by everyone, everywhere for how I look. I feel lonely, tried some dating apps, got okish feedback and interest even if being honest. But I'm sure everyone still felt how insecure I am. Every time I matched with someone I was like damn she's way out of my league (I'm actually somewhat picky I'd say) and even if it went further and she still liked me I started to realise I got no money to go no where. Even if I find someone who accepts me for what I am I probably can't accept myself for what I am. 

You know I can be very naive at times, currently chatting with this woman. She lost 200+lbs herself. She's super nice but lives 3-4 hours away. She's turned her life around a few years earlier and finished her master this year. She's such a sweet person. We message daily. When I go through the messages I get the impression that she might have actually been interested in more than a friendship. But I feel like I f*cked it up by being stupid. If my situation was different I would asked her out. I don't wanna go into too much detail but it gets worse every day. I think about ending the chat but I would lose someone I probably developed feelings for.

I'm way to focused on her, just being the naive guy I am. Probably lovesick. I understand that there's more women than her but what I realised is that I'm no where near in the position to actually date someone. I might have made good progress physically, but my mental is still a wreck. Also my overall situation is nothing but a mess. For me to get out of that it will take easily 3-5 years if not more. So 3 more years at least of being alone. When I go grocery shopping and I see all the couples I feel so fucking sad. Every damn time. It hurts so much. And I haven't had any experiences yet. What if I meet or have already met her but I was too stupid or my situation still to fucked to make something out of it. Man that bothers me so much. 

I regret having lived the life the way I did. Sometimes I feel like I can turn it around but recently I get more and more scared that I f*cked up too bad and it's only getting worse. Especially considering that I'm obviously only getting older. The fact I got no money right now really holds me back so much it's insane. I question anything because my progress is so slow. Maintaining my weight takes a lot of energy already. I go to college again in november. I'm really happy that I got accepted and it's a good chance to get in touch with women and learn how to be around them etc. But it's gonna be such a slow progress and I already know that I'm gonna be alone. 

I don't expect anything here. I just wanted to get this off of my chest. 

To anyone, if you're like early 20s. Man you got it all ahead of you. Can say the same for me ofc but I might be able to live life at maybe age 40 which is still better than being dead right (why did I say that...)? Don't waste your life kids. If you make change and turn it around you will realise how bad you f*cked up. Don't be as stupid as I am. Please for gods sake. I wasted my best years.

YES, I made my share of mistakes and often took for granted that she would always be there for me (us).

Until one morning as we were getting ready for work she told me that she was leaving me and moving out. 
This devastated my soul.

And while I have dated since then, I just haven't found anyone to spend my life with.
Someone to share the good along with the hardships that are just a normal part of life.
 
I am college educated and hold degrees in engineering along with long time studies in psychology.
 
As the weather turned warm, I watched people as they went about their day, hand in hand.
Maybe I shouldn't admit this but it brings a tear to my eyes.

My heart long's for companionship,
Someone who loves to discover life,
Someone who enjoys debating life, love and the nature of the universe.

I understand it's a little weird, but really it's better than sitting at home day after day. Also being in my vehicle doesn't bother anyone, if it does I just, drive somewhere else.

Anyway, so I just had went into AutoZone and picked up some seat covers and some cleaning stuff. Have a relationship with AutoZone and I go there kind of a lot. Get along with some of the guys there.

Don't have any family or anyone close, so, I tend to hang out randomly.

Anyway, doing some stuff on the car, just simple cleaning stuff. Finish, throw everything in the trunk, sit in the driver seat and read my book. I read digital books like on my phone.

Few minutes pass and I feel and hrar a pull on my passenger door. For some reason, I instinctually unlocked my door. Not sure why I did that, I understand the risks and whatever behind it.

Cuter lady just, sits down in my rear seat. Plops down and has a nice perfume scent about her. I immediately turn into shy mode and say ""hey"". Could've been robbing me, and I'm over here smiling. All my street cred you can just, throw out the window.

After I said hey, moved the rear view mirror to get a better look at her and she smiled, blushed and said ""hey"" back. Bout the same age group, then she asked if I was there for a um... Nickname... and I'm like... No. 

Asks if I was Uber, I said no.

She then just kind of sat there and started shaking her head. Sat back in the seat and said ""well, you seem like a nice guy"" and on we talked. She asked me and talked with me for awhile and she just seemed pretty nice and generally trusting.

Asked if she'd prefer the front passenger seat and offered her a ride to wherever. She got out, got back in, had the AC running and we talked a bit more. I feel nervous and asked her where she's headed and if she'd like to go.

So we start driving and we're doing some laughing, some joking. Dropped her off, she gave me her number.

I don't know. Just was a pretty cool thing, started texting some back and forth and she seems pretty cool. Don't really have any expectations or anything, but, you know. Just a nice experience I wanted to share.

Even if it was something like getting a free ride type scam, was just nice sitting with her in the car and speaking with her. Probably spent about an hour with eachother and then the 10 min drive down the road.

He hopes that my life will be good but he doesn't understand that not being strong and athletic and having less than average looks, anxiety, boring personality and old-fashioned mindset lower my chances pretty much to zero.

I don't understand how he still doesn't see that I am pretty much mom's basement dweller with no attractive qualities. He doesn't understand almost any of this because he at least has charisma and good looks (heck, even I got a little horny for him that one time). I try to be decent, kind and helpful to everyone but unfortunately and ironically it's not enough for anyone.

I probably come out as a whiny bitch but I try very hard to keep all my feelings to myself and find peace.

Right now he has much more serious problems to deal with but, man, it's still sucks for me and I can't stop think about all of this.

The only people who still keep me going are my parents. It hurts so much to hear their bantering about me finding love of all my life, having kids and living normal independent life. I am already really sorry to them for causing all their future pain.

I can’t continue. My only Reddit friend has ghosted me. 

I live alone at 21 don’t have any friends, don’t have any family..

I’m out of a job and can’t find another one.

I’m just a wreck. Everything keeps going wrong. I have nothing to live for.

I empathise but can’t relate to a lot of the people on here because although they are lonely most have at minimum a family which I don’t.

I’m dealing also with PTSD from a traumatic childhood and Anorexia which is a byproduct of that traumatic childhood. (135lbs -  6’2).

Can’t nobody tell me I didn’t try because I fucking have.

 All of a sudden one of my friends unexpectedly committed suicide on my 3rd year of highschool, then two more of my friends left the country due to their personal reasons and I am left with one, which I call my best friend until today.

I'm a very introverted person who is sometimes totally fine hanging out with one friend, and they've really helped me progressed through highschool together.

As much as I treasure my closest friend in my highschool life, I kinda feel were slowly drifting away, considering how we always hang out afterschool, during the weekends, basically as bros. One day, him and a girl I had a small crush on started dating, and this really just screwed with my mental state, even today. What upsets me is not because theyre now dating (as in I dont have interest in that girl anymore), but it's the fact that because of her, he'll stop hanging out with me more, leaving me behind.

I know that I can't decide on my best friend's choices, and that I support them together as a couple, but I just have this sense that no one really values me anymore, which is affecting my mental state, and that affects both my everyday and highschool life.

Sometimes I go out with them and everything but its just the same. They caring more about themselves and other shits, and I sometimes just stay quiet in my own place.

Family doesn't help also. Even if they care more, its just not the same.

I'm starting to feel that the problem is me. I barely can make new friends, online or on real life. Even though I'm a good guy and a good personality, I can barely talk to anyone. Its rare that I actually talk to someone on the regular.

I'm also starting to feel that actually talking to girls its going to be super hard for me all over again. Getting a relationship nowadays is waaaaaaaaaay differente than before, and I can see that is super bad and I hate it. On top of all of this, I got super agressive insecurities with myself, my body and all of that.

Had a few dreams this night that circled around relationships and being close to people with X chromosomes. I hate it every god damn time it happens, I just feel like trash. For the past few years I managed to block out the loneliness that I felt, focusing on myself instead and just trying to enjoy life/take it how it is... but these dreams always knock me down for a week.

It's bad enough that I may feel attracted to the people in my dreams, but not even having someone to talk to/hug (like one of my former best friends (had a crush on her, we still were normal friends after we talked about it for years), but we just went our separate ways after things happened and I realized she wasn't good for my mental health anyway) really just fucks me. In 3 days I'll be able to go out again, I'll see pretty girls and feel lonely and at some point I'll be back to ""This is just the way it is."".

And I can't even ""play with the old monkey"", because that's also bad for my mental health.

Once that's the case, I'll try and ask people out, if the occasion comes up... Recently saw 2 girls wearing some super unique style (similar to grunge, I guess) and after maning up and looking for them in half the town I just passed by and said ""Nice style"" (while getting a ""Thank you!"" from them) and I was shivering and almost broke down for half a minute. If I were to ask someone out I'd probably go up and be like ""He-ey *gulp* Wanna go get some.. coffee sometime?"". Certainly not the confidence that people are interested in.",lonely,I hate dreams,2020-09-06 00:24:56

And I don’t have any friends anymore. Maybe because I’ve turned so negative and toxic. I’ve tried to turn my life countless of times but I keep going back into this whole. I mostly blame it on my family for making me work so much inorder to stay in school but in the end caused me my mental health. All my friends now are doing their masters or have good jobs and I’m just looking as if it’s a dead end street. 

I just feel like everyday I’m loosing my ability to talk to people. I talk at work but I follow a script. Just interacting with people feels different. I’m crying as I type this out because I never really told anyone how I felt. I actually feel a lone and poty myself kind of. I guess I’m just venting...

I just feel like I have no convidence. A lot of people know me in real life but I guess I owe it to myself for making myself feel lonely and excluded.

I need help and I cry for myself why I can’t fight this feeling of loneliness. Ally past friends groups all have clicks now and it’s hard to invite yourself into it.

2431,RevelInIsolation,1599304425,1,"Bear with me, because this is incredibly long, but I have to get this out in detail. It's just for me, and I doubt anybody will actually ready this.

For reference, I'm now 25 years old. To start things off, I have never had a family. None, nada, nonexistent. Both my mother and father's family have decided to pretend I don't exist. These are not small families either. My father and mother both have more than five siblings and many children and yet none of them want to know that I exist. Just me. Nobody else. The drug addicted gangster is welcome anytime, but just not me. On my mother's side, she's not welcome either, to be fair. I've somehow done something to people who I've never known.  
My cousin did however once reach out and invite me to a family gathering last year. I was happy to go. But then I was told it wasn't happening. I found out on social media that it did. And I received a message from a family member asking if I was reaching out because I wanted something from them. That they weren't here to give handouts and that I'm not welcome within their family.

My father died before I was born(murdered by his brother a month before). This left me with just my mother. My relationship with her was always highly volatile. Due to her own experiences, she doesn't believe that we are affectionate and loving people and so she has never bothered to show me such treatment. She also really doesn't like children. For almost all of my childhood, I was in a position where I had to fend for myself emotionally. I was fed, taken to the doctor when I was sick and well looked after, but my emotional needs were irrelevant.  
For some reason, I found this to be a reason to immediately distrust my mother and refuse to tell her anything. I was 5. But I then somehow began realising that it is better that I not tell her anything.

Over the years, I have tried to connect emotionally with my mother, however I've been mostly dismissed. That has existed since till now, and is in fact far more advanced than ever. I will honestly never tell my mother anything about me emotionally, or for that matter I won't even try. In fact, her idea of the type of person I am is completely at odds with anything about me. It hurts me to type this. 25 years in the same home, and you've no understanding of me or my identity(not that I have knowledge of my identity anymore either). If one were to describe our relationship, it would be that of roommates.

When I was 7, I met my stepfather. I introduced him to my mother, interestingly enough. I was very inquisitive and would pry on his business, as he lived in the complex we stayed in. It started off well.

Once they started dating, he was around a lot more. My first troublesome moment with him, was when I got into a fight with a kid 5 years older than me. I ended up with a black eye. I'd never even had a fight before, so I didn't know what to do. This kid beat me up and he was standing right there shouting ""What is wrong with you?"" at me. He even told my mom the boys in the complex will think of me as a sissy. And even she sided with him. 

The funny thing is, he never, throughout my childhood, ever taught me how to fight. Not once. He just criticised my ability to do anything.

This was a constant throughout my childhood. I used to get full A's in my first few years of school(which really isn't hard at all), and I got one C, and I remember him saying he's disappointed because I got a C.  

If you're a little confused as to his role, I've never had or known a father. He can't actually have children. My mother seemed to place him in the role of being my father and I didn't really accept or deny it, it merely happened.

Fast forward, and in basic terms, he's a drunk and a gambler who messed my mother around, and spent his life pretending I didn't exist or telling me what is wrong with me. Why can't I be confident and have friends like other kids? Why am I shy? Why do I always stay in my room?   
I actually used to admire my mother. She was a tough, hardworking woman. I looked up to how driven she was. All the years with my stepfather completely drained every ounce of that out of her. She became trapped and helpless from not having a job and being reliant(we moved closer to his work because he made more money) on him. She's very docile now and a completely different to the mother who would stand up against anyone who would say anything against her. Everything fell to pieces. 

He's hit her twice. Once when I was there. He's also hit me twice. The first time he punched me a few times in the face. The second time he hit me with a metal bar and stamped on my head. In a way, he tried to kill me, and then told me it was my fault. Throughout all this, my mother was getting older and struggling to get a job, so I don't really blame her for any of this. There are no shelters or assistance for these kinds of things in my country.

When I was writing my final exams of high school, he hadn't paid the rent, and a gang of men came to our home threatening to shoot us if we didn't leave immediately. It was just me and my mom. He had left us behind as he'd found another woman who told him he could stay with her and he wasn't required to work or do anything. After high school, I found a job and had to support my mom as there just weren't any work for someone of her age category and experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout my life, I have thought of all these things as nothing but formalities. That at the end of it all, I will lead a better life. Away from poverty. Away from misery.  
But my therapist brought it up that my depression is not my fault. That there were things out of my control. And since then, these things have started to bother me immensely. They occupy my thoughts of every day at every waking moment. They push me further into the hole I've dug for myself.

As for the family, I never cared. I never knew better. But now I wonder why? What's wrong with me that they hated me so much? Why am I so bad? What did I do? Am I that revolting? Why can't I have a family?

&amp;#x200B;

That's just family. My friendships, or lack of, have encountered similar problems.

Did I mention this was long?

&amp;#x200B;

If I reflect back on my life, I've had two friendships throughout my existence.

The first idea of supposed friendship was when I was 6. In my first year of school, I was bullied by this kid who pushed me down these large stone steps. For some reason, after a while I came to think he was my friend and invited him home one day. He even tried to break my mom's TV by throwing it off the stand and had me in a headlock for most of the way there.  
I can't really understand why I became friends with him. Some need for any attention I can get, perhaps.

Anyways, the first friendship I can class as real was shortly after. I had a best friend who I spent a lot of time with. But soon after, his mom passed and I moved away, and we never kept in contact. I did see him when I was around 20 in a store. We greeted and then carried on with our lives. We were friends as kids, but strangers now. 

My second friendship was when I was 12. I had another really good friend who I spent a lot of time with. However, his parents had a massive problem with me being mixed race when I was at his home, and he didn't want to be friends with me anymore afterwards.

That's it. I've had a few acquaintances in childhood who hung out with a bit but nothing more. 

I was bullied incessantly as a kid at every school I went to. It honestly just became the norm for me. I was very shy and struggled with being around lots of people(and in a school, you always are).  This continued into high school, until I snapped a bit. This kid placed a sign on my back calling me a fa\*\*ot and I walked around the school with that on. No teacher bothered to even say anything. I saw it when I went to the bathroom. For some reason, I just lost it and I went back and smashed my plastic pencil case across his face. Then I punched him continuously until I was pulled away. I did have a similar reaction in 6th grade where I punched a kid after I'd been bullied for most of the year. However, this time it was markedly different. I gained a kind of no-fear mode and a largely heightened sense of aggression. If someone had a problem with me, I would move immediately to wanting or causing a fight in any way I could. From shy and withdrawn, I would immediately become loud and filled with rage. I developed a reputation this way and people would no longer even think of coming across me the wrong way. This is how I learned to fight. However, it meant people still chose to distance themselves from me and I remained without any friends.  
In my time as an adult, I've lost that aggression, because frankly, fighting is stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, in my time as an adult, I find it nigh on impossible to even remotely think of trusting anyone. 

The funny thing is, I usually choose not to trust people, but after a while I let up, and then that's when I get hurt. I usually find a reason not to trust people, but then I think I'm being unreasonable, and funnily enough, that reason tends to become true once I disregard it.

My most recent apparent friend was one who tried to sell me into a scam so he can make money.

I've never been invited out for drinks or to a staff gathering or anything. I'm usually the guy that people come to when they want something. That's just my experience. And it sucks.  
I've always tried to be helpful, and if I can, I will help you. I will honestly go as far out of my way as humanly possible if it is within my capability. However, more often that not, in fact, almost always, I have been taken advantage of. And when I pull away and start saying no, I am immediately classed as a selfish asshole and called other things I won't bother to recount.

I can safely say I've never had someone ask about me, or wonder how I'm doing. Never had someone ask me to have a drink or lunch with them, or anything. I feel like I've spent my life being everyone's personal outlet. That seems a bit conceited, but I feel like that's been my role in this world.

However, it probably is my fault as I trust no one. However, even the idea of being myself conflicts with me. It's almost like I've lived my life as a lie for so long that I have no understanding of my identity or if I even have one. I don't really know anything about myself or who I am, and I can't let go of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent my entire life without any form of support. None. While my parents take credit, I grew up alone, and had to fend for myself emotionally. I learned to be strong without another. I learned to internalise everything and to keep myself away from others. I learned that nobody cares about my pain and that I've got to face it all alone. I've learned that no therapist can help me if I can't figure out my own jumbled mess of a human that I am(experience, I've been trying)

I've learned that my strength alone is waning and I'm not sure of how much longer I can survive like this.

I've learned that everything that I've internalised and hidden away my entire life is now forcing it's way back up and driving me so far into loneliness, depression and hopelessness that I can barely perform the most basic tasks and I can no longer process a single logical thought without interruption. I learned that I need to be stronger alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I never believed I was lonely.

2433,ZeroRei13,1599299790,1,"For a bit of context that will be important later on in this post, I have OCD which makes me keep repeating certain things when using my phone (amongst other things, but this is the one relevant to what I'm gonna write about). So as a result I've stopped using that phone and am using an older type phone to communicate with people. However, since I stopped using that one altogether, I no longer had my friends' phone numbers.

I texted one of them from my mom's Messenger (she allowed me to, of course) and gave him my new number, and I told him to call me so I'll have his number as well. Yeah, this was in March and he still hasn't called.

Then I hung out with a friend (who mind you I hang out like once a month because he's eternally busy, except he's not busy to hang out with friends from different cities, so ""I'm too busy for you"" would be a more accurate way for him to put it), whose number I had because we are in the same school so I gave him my new number there and he actually did call so I'd have his number. Anyway, so we hung out at the end of July or maybe early August, somewhere around then, and a friend of ours was in the area. Now I hadn't spoken with that girl since March when I stopped using my phone. So since she was close to where we were, we met up with her. I gave her my new phone number, and SHE said she'll call me the next day to hang out. Next day rained and so she didn't call. Ok, fair enough, it rained, so even if she had called we wouldn't have been able to meet anyway. No problem there. Except this was in very early August (at the latest), and she STILL hasn't called.

Then there's this guy I was friends with up until 4 years ago. He contacted me after all this time, and it was him who said we should hang out. So we schedule for a Wednesday. The day comes and I ask him via text what time are we meeting at. He doesn't reply. The day ends and he doesn't reply. 6 days pass and he doesn't reply. I text him asking what happened, and he just said he was busy and also we can't meet for now because he's going on vacation. How freaking busy can you be that you can't text me ""Something came up.""?

There's also a girl who lives in a different city who never calls me first, it's always me. So I actually talked with her about this, she explained her situation, which is understandable enough, but I won't go into details here, and she said she'll be able to talk this Friday, and that she'll let me know via text. Yeah, it's Sunday and that didn't happen.

So yeah, I've come to the conclusion that ""I'll call you"" is complete bullshit.",lonely,"""I'll call you"" is bullshit.",2020-09-05 19:56:30

2437,hateme_justblockme,1599296415,1,"First time poster here, but I just want to open my mind for someone to potentially read it.

I'm 20+ years old, but when I was a teenager I used to have a lot of friends. I never felt lonely cause I always had someone. 

4 years ago something traumatic happened, and I ended up isolating myself. The first 2 years I didn't talk to anyone, neither my family nor my friends. I couldnt leave my house anymore. I was lying in bed every single day doing nothing but sleeping. I didn't feel lonely at all. 

2 years ago I was still isolated, but I started to talk to my family again, and I made some Internet friends. I picked up gaming as a hobby and suddenly I had something to do. I didn't feel lonely. 

0,5 years ago I dropped some of my best internet friends. They were making me feel down, and they affected my life more negatively than positively. I wanted to be in a positive environment, so I removed myself from the situation. At the same time my best internet friend turned into my long distance significant other. I didn't feel lonely. 

The last month I picked up contact with a lot of my irl friends. Unfortunately I can't be with them because of Covid-19 and my traumtic thing, but I text them frequently. I reached out to my family outside my house, and we are building up our relationship again. I spend a lot of time talking with my s.o, and I game with my remaining internet friends every week. I have never felt more lonely. 

I feel so bad for saying it, but I'm so lonely. I shouldn't be, but I am. Why? I don't know. What can I do about it? I don't know. My life feels so empty, and I'm desperately trying to find something to fill the hole. I tried posting on looking- for- friends subreddits, because I thought a new friend would help... It didn't. I have tried gaming more, it didn't help. I have tried finding more and new hobbies, so far no progress. 

What do I do? Is this just a phase? Am I overreacting? Why am I lonely when my life is so much better now than the last 4 years...?

I feel so stranded and alone out here in the desert. I live on fort irwin right now and since I joined the army it just feels like my life disappeared. My friends and family are all gone and I’m stranded by “the box” that surrounds the base. I don’t have a car yet so I can’t drive off post, but I hope as soon as I can do that things will get better.

I just need to have that physical touch again, and I wish I could be there for my family. I already wasn’t there for my grandfather when he passed but even though I know he was proud of what I’m doing, I still got really depressed and eventually got sent to a mental health place and almost got chartered out.

I feel so alone and honestly I don’t feel much of anything anymore. I try to avoid it now, but I used to cut, or even burn myself just to feel something. On training rotations I do small cuts on my face with knife, but have to do it small enough so no one else in my track realizes what I’ve done.

About 2 months ago I met this girl, she was super pretty, smart, and adorable
 she would always go out of her way to talk to me, after the first week it was very apparent she had feelings for me. It didnt feel real, I felt like I was dreaming.

 The thing is I have hardcore trust issues as I have been cheated on in every relationship I've been in. I warned her about my past and that I'm either super clingy or I push people away and sometimes both. She told me she was also super clingy and wondered what would happen if 2 clingy people were interested in each other. That same night she fell asleep on call with me. This would happen every night for about a month.

It was the first time my soul really felt at ease, like I could finally open up to someone again after such a long time, but me being me I was afraid of getting hurt again and started to push her away. I know I can't blame her for not trying to stay close to me, but deep down I really really really wanted her to tell me she wasn't going anywhere. After 2 or 3 days she stopped messaging me to hang out with her, she stopped telling me about how her day went, and when I texted her it was obvious she didnt want to talk. After I realized what I had done, I ended up undoing all the hard work I put into getting my life on track again. I was sober for 8 months, I had a great job, I was super involved with my family and friends, and university was going great. 

About a week ago I started to smoke again. I have been sleeping in a lot, showing up late to work and I have been canceling my plans I had. I just don't wanna be me it's always been like this for me. I always manage to screw up all the good things in my life. It all feels so hopeless. There is 100% something wrong with me, what other reason is there for my exes to cheat on me?

Today, I worked for another company and the HR told me that this ex boss had said really bad things about me when she was a reference. She had said I was disorganized, could not write well in French (which is my mother tongue) and because of her comments, I almost did not get the job I have.

ever since I started in new school, upper secondary.

They send me their snap account just to send me S.

6 hours of work 1 hours of break everyday at school. more and more time has been taken from me as I have become older. just work work work and adult say that is just part of growing up. I fear that I might not even get friends in adulthood because so little time I have. like a ticking bomb that would eventually explode. As time passby, I am at school doing every work for 7 hour without socializing. feel unmotivated to continue, knowing that the future most likely resulting me alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I come home, I try to contact friends or family members. they are all busy and have already made plans with others. I get into my room looking at all the homework I have and thinking about how lonely I am.

You know; people who know you, and actually care about you.  I'm not talking about all these fake people that are a dime a dozen out there.  I'm talking about people who call you to see if you want to hang out.  I'm talking about people that you can just chill with.  I'm talking about people who don't have to put you down to make themselves feel better.  I'm talking about people who aren't just trying to befriend you in order to gain an unfair advantage.  Where are these people?  Do they even exist anymore?  Did I imagine these things when I was child?  Did I die one day and go to hell if hell even exists?

Today, it seems like everyone is looking out for ""number one"" (themselves).  Everyone is chasing the almighty dollar.  No one cares about anyone anymore.  Everyone's head is up their own ass.  People die, and we hear about it on the news, and we continue about our day without a second thought, most of the time.  We've become desensitized.  Are we even human anymore?  Have we transcended to robotic humanoids?  We attack people just for having a different opinion.  We attack people for being different.  Why? WHY?!  I'll tell you why.  It's one word...  Xenophobia.  I'm not singling out any particular group of people either.  There seems to be enough xenophobia to go around these days.

All I do is work, and when I'm not at work, I look for more work to do, so I can distract myself from the monotony of loneliness.

I haven't had a girl friend in years; 13 years to be exact.  A few years ago, I did date this girl for a very brief period of time who was Mensa smart, and she ghosted me because my grammar did not meet her acceptance criteria.  I'm pretty much convinced that I will die alone.  I've gone to the bars and clubs only to get rejected over and over.  Afterwards, I drive home by myself in tears.  Sometimes, I cry myself to sleep at night.  Sometimes, I wish I could make myself disappear, so people wouldn't have to look at me.  Sometimes, I wish I could shrink myself really small for the same reason.  Sometimes, at night, I wish I could freeze time, so I wouldn't have to continue on with life.  Sometimes, I wish that when I go to sleep that I won't wake up in the morning.

Begrudgingly, I march through life like a soldier trying to survive the elements.  I have created a callus over my mental anguish.   I will never stop moving forward in this life no matter how shitty it gets.  I will not take a bow.  I will never give up.

2476,Sunflower__J,1599269962,1,So I’m in my last year of college trying to become a teacher. I’m also a single mom of one beautiful lil girl. I currently live with my mom since I’m not able to work full time since I haven’t graduated yet. Anyways today my sister invited us to come to her vacation house on the river and it’s only two hours away so I said I rather just go for the day and my mom wanted to spend the weekend so I said we could take separate cars then and she got mad and said I never wanna do anything as a family and I should want to spend more time with my sister and nieces and I don’t care about her or what she wants and then she started saying to just forget it and we won’t even go and I just shouldn’t even come around her anymore bc I only come when I need stuff. This is just so hard bc I do need stuff of course but I literally live with my mom and spend every single day with her and do stuff with her so the time. It’s just so hard and isolating when she gets all mad like this and I literally have no one. She even said that me and my brother and sister all just do stuff with our own families and only come to her when we need her for something but literally my brother and sister both have husband and wives and houses and kids and I’m just a single mom all on my own trying to desperately make it thru my last year of college and I would literally be homeless without my moms help. And the worst part is I tried telling my sister about how my mom was being and she literally just said “awesome.” And she’s always going on and on about how’s she’s here for me at other times but never ever has once lifted a finger to help me in any way at all and she judged me so much when I got pregnant.

2482,henker220,1599266790,1,"Last summer, I (22M) met a woman (23F) on Interpals and I got attached to her very quickly. She initiated contact by telling me she was impressed by the number of languages I was learning on my profile and things went on from there. This woman enjoyed my humor and told me I was interesting to speak with. Then, we had other not so glamorous things in common. We both dealt with depression (it was especially bad for me because I couldn't access my meds for 4 months), an abusive parent, and just loneliness in general. Even pre-COVID and especially now, I had/have no social life and the little bit of IRL contact with the outside is with co-workers who are my parents' age and my one friend I get to see every other month if I'm lucky. 

Anyway, we opened up to each other and became close. She told me I was the best thing that ever happened to her and that she loved me. Having never dated before and having no IRL female friends, this meant a lot to me. After about two months, she ghosted me. She met another man and got engaged to him without saying anything to me about it. If the roles were reversed, I would have told her about the other person and I wouldn't have cut contact with her without so much as a goodbye. I hate her and I miss her at the same time.

I feel so emotionally attached to her because (among other reasons) she was Russian (at least her parents were and she spoke the language). I'm a Russophile and am fascinated with that part of the world. She thought that was cool. She was also understanding about me being autistic and dealing with bad depression. I was so happy the one day we got to FaceTime and I'll always remember her beautiful voice. In real life and on actual dating apps, I'm a nobody. I can't get a like or a match no matter what I change on my profile and just walking up and talking to women is frowned upon and creepy even though I literally have no other avenues to meet women. On Interpals and similar sites, the women I talk to on there are amazed that I know about their countries/cultures and can speak their language(s) and tell me how smart and creative I am.

I feel very heartbroken and betrayed by what this woman did. She gets to be married and have her child on the way and live a happy life with everything she wants. What do I get? My heart sent through a wood chipper. The fact that I lost out to another dude she met online makes me feel even less desirable.

Like some other quotes said:

""Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever""
And
""Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of the fear you're going through right now""

I just watched a film of the same name as the title of this post and these were the first few words uttered. And although the context was entirely different, they seem completely relevant to me. I've never quite related so much to something as I have to these few sentences. I know it may seem pretentious and flatulent but I'm pretty sure some of you would agree. I'm not suicidal or anything but I have been and I know how it feels and the notion of unhappiness is always there in the back of your mind whether you're having a good time or not.

I actually made this post hoping to find a friend but I thought maybe I should start it off so someone could relate somehow. I've tried all the friend finding subreddits but have never really succeeded so I hope I could find someone here. Hopefully I meet someone. This is about to be a long post, I apologize.


Um Hello there!


I'm a 19 year old mostly introverted guy and I'm looking for a genuine friendship!


Here are some of the things I enjoy -


*READING* - I like reading books. Um, I prefer reading philosophical, historical fiction, existential and lgbt books mostly. The Stranger, CMBYN and All The Light We Cannot See are some of my favourites.

*FILMS* - I'm a sucker for pretentious and indie/arthouse films, so it'd be cool to have someone to talk about that with. We could give each other our LetterBoxd accounts. My favourites are CMBYN, Pulp Fiction, Frances Ha, Lady Bird, Mommy, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, Million Dollar Baby, The Lighthouse, Taxi Driver, Un Homme Qui Dort etc etc

*TV SHOWS* - I have watched about 56 shows. Yes, I keep count and I know I have no life. But that's what happens when you don't have friends, gotta fill the ever-growing void of loneliness inside me somehow. Ahem, anyways, some of my favourites are Breaking Bad, Mr. Robot, Fleabag, Euphoria, Rick and Morty, The Leftovers, The Sopranos, Russian Doll, Friends, The Office and moree.

*FOOTBALL* - I really enjoy playing and watching football. I'm a lifelong Arsenal fan and yeah, that's about it. I also like to bike sometimes. 

*MUSIC* - I usually listen to Rap/Pop Rock/Indie Alt. Eminem, J Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Halsey, Harry Styles, Lorde, Sufjan Stevens, Perfume Genius, M83, Fiona Apple, Of Monsters and Men, Queen, Blondie are some of the artists/bands I enjoy listening to.

*GAMING* - I don't think I can classify myself as a conventional ""gamer"" because I only really enjoy playing single-player games so I can escape reality and my crippling depression for a while and immerse myself into another world...jk sorry, i'll stop with the morbid jokes now. I really liked playing God of War, The Last of Us and Detroit. 

*SPACE SCIENCE* - Weee! I wanna become an astronaut! No, not really? I don't know, we'll see. I'm thinking of studying Mechanical Engineering in university and then doing a Masters in Aerospace Engineering and I'd hopefully like to work in the aerospace industry one day :)

*PHILOSOPHY &amp; ART HISTORY* - I got into Philosophy thanks to PEWDIEPIE! I really enjoy reading philosophical texts and books and trying to understand the ""mEaNiNG oF LiFE"". And I got into Art History thanks to Marzia lol. I just read articles about paintings and stuff mostly, it's fascinating.


Um yeah, that's about all I can conjure about myself to present to you and hopefully convince you to want to be my friend 👈

Also, I'd also appreciate if you could introduce yourself or tell me about your interests/hobbies when you message me :)

Welp, that's me. Hope you have a good day/night :)

2507,judenotjudas,1599250597,1,"Basically the title. I’ve been trying to make friends for over a year since I left college (and left all my shitty friends who went behind my back behind). It just feels impossible. I’m younger than everyone I work with and they’re nice but not really friends. I try using apps because now with Covid being really bad where I live you can’t meet people. It’s so hard to keep conversations going, I feel like I put in effort with so many people, show genuine interest in them. I don’t think I’m boring either, I feel like I have a cool job and fun hobbies to talk about. But it always just dies out, with people not responding or responding after days without much interest. 

Idk why it was so much easier to make friends when I was younger (high school and college). It makes me wonder if I’m less likeable and too boring now that I work full time (I’m 21). I just feel so fucking lonely. I used to really rely on my friends when I had them. Now I literally have nobody to talk to about anything, and I live alone so it’s unbearably lonely sometimes.

I am interested in art so I would love to make online friends but I have no idea where to do that and if it’s any easier than making friends through apps like Bumble. 

I woke up this morning and the loneliness just hit me first thing, because I don’t have work today and so I have nobody to talk to and nothing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I never know how to appropriately summarize the events of my early life, but here goes.

I grew up in what people refer to as a broken home.  It wasn't very typical, however. The ruined pieces would never fit back together, but we would never have enough money to survive without each other either.  My mom worked hard to take care of us (3) for the few hours she had between work and falling asleep on the floor, in a chair, or at the dinner table. My dad was settling comfortably into disability cheques and a life of addiction in our living room. Perhaps that seems unfair to say, but we know there are bad people in the world who enjoy the things that make them monsters. I have always believed this of him. 

Anyways, life was tricky. I experienced consistent trauma during my developmental years (to the point of not remembering most of my life). I left home at an early age; as soon as I could get a legal job to present on a rental application. I've been assaulted, robbed, conned, dragged through the mud in more ways than I can bring myself to mention. It's hard to say, in retrospect, if leaving home really was the best thing to do. I was worried I would kill myself if I stayed, but even in recent years, I have caught myself wondering if that would have been so bad. Leaving home cost me my education and most of my relationships. It wore me down the way I saw it wear my mom down. I worked so hard... So many jobs... Took so many classes... Met so many people that would hurt me or be hurt by me.

After everything, It's strange to report now that I have actually done it. I'm 25/F. I'm in love with my partner of 5 years. After 6 years of trying, I have finally got my diploma and into post-secondary. I will be moving to a big city (which I can actually see myself affording) to attend university in the coming weeks. I finished cognitive behavioral therapy recently, as well as my last shift at ideally my last empty job. This is the moment that I thought would resolve so many things for me... But now that it's not busy, I realize how alone I am. I have my partner, but no one else to congratulate me on my success or thank me for doing the work that they couldn't. I thought it would be enough to be proud of myself, but I'm just tired. I have no safety net, I never had the time to maintain friends to celebrate with or rely on, and I don't have a family that is willing to get to know me, the life I've had to live, and the dreams that I am finally starting to fulfill. I am afraid that my foundation is too broken for me to ever feel like my accomplishments are enough. I just want to feel safe and be seen.",lonely,I was too busy to realize how alone I've always been.,2020-09-05 03:04:56

Except when I'm outside of work, I get sad and lonely.  I live near my family, I live near friends, I have a wonderful, long time girlfriend in my life but unfortunately we are long distance and our relationship is complicated (her parents are conservative, brown immigrants that don't know I exist).

Regardless of all this. No one reaches out to me.  I rarely get text from family, maybe once a week or twice a month.  I have been visiting more often, usually three times a week.  My girlfriend and myself try to talk when we can but it's been difficult.  So we try to text.  Except as of late we exchange maybe 4 or 5 text a day. Some days we don't even text and just have a quick hi, I love you chat for 2 mins and that's it.  I'm so so so tired of always reaching out.  I was very shy and introverted just 7 years ago.  University brought me towards a more extroverted personality due to the sheer amount of people, but it's been slowing down ever since.

I'm burnt out.  I can't keep this always reaching out to my friends bullshit.

Anyway, some context: I’m in college and about to graduate. I didn’t make many long lasting relationships. I’m in a relationship with someone I very much love but sometimes I feel insecure that he’ll get bored of me eventually.. as all long term relationships inevitably become and hopefully overcome. I have no best friends. I just know a lot of people. Sometimes I’ll get invited to random parties and dinners— but it’s usually because my boyfriend is the popular one and all his friends welcome me to “tag” along essentially and I get along very well with them. But they’re not my friends and none of the girl groups have ever personally asked me to hang out with them outside of events so I just tag along and stick with my boyfriend. The only people who text or call me is my family and boyfriend. Like my phone is literally useless. 

Anyway, recently I’ve been feeling really lonely. Within the last two years, I lost two really close friends (cut ties) because our lives were just going separate ways. I felt that one was making really poor life decisions and the other was just extremely manipulative. So I decided for the sake of my mental health, to just cut them out. But now, I catch myself feeling really lonely with no one to check up on me daily. Or no one to text me about random, funny things. Idk best friend girl things. 

But also, I know that those people just weren’t good for me anymore. So, I’m trying to make new friends but I don’t know how. Literally. 

Sounds cliche but girls don’t like me. I’ve never had luck with female friends which is why the two that I lost recently were actually friends I’ve had for more than 5 years. It’s just frustrating and sad because I know I’m a nice person :-( but girls just... don’t like me. Either they already have a friend group or hate me out of jealousy and immaturity (very bluntly speaking.. long story).

To be honest, I've never had 'real' friends. I don't know what friendship is like, exactly. I try to stick to people I come across, offline and online both. Offline people are usually not interested in maintaining friendship with me. But I've had a few good online friends. 
Not trying to boast, but I'm a kind of a person who puts in efforts to keep my friendships, if our frequecy matches. I've had a lot of online friends, and I put in a lot of efforts in each of them. But somehow, I get ghosted in the end, everytime. 
I was friends with a guy from Norway. We used to chat a lot about everything. Because we were in different time zones, it used to be a bit difficult to settle for a time, when we both would be available to chat. So, I used to stay up until 2 am in the morning, just so that we could have a good conversation. Ultimately with this, I ruined my sleep cycle. I am not saying that it was a big deal, what I mean to say is that I put in 'efforts' for our friendship. But it didn't matter, because he ended up ghosting me. 

There was another guy who was into robotics and he was quite passionate about it. I used to read about robotics, just so that I could keep our conversation going. Mind you, robotics is not my thing at all, because I'm a medical student and I barely have any idea about robotic machines. But I still put in 'efforts' to read about it, so that we could have something to talk about. But still, he ghosted me. 

This has happened with me multiple times, with a couple of more people. No matter how hard I try to put in efforts, I always get ghosted. 

Currently, I'm friends with an American guy, he's a good person. But he's been suffering from too many mental issues. He is partly depressed and has a lot going on in his life. He had a traumatic past that affects his life now. I try my best to be available when he needs someone to be there for him. He gets a lot of panic attacks and nightmares, so I gave him my number to call, during emergency. I don't regret doing any of that. It's been 7 months I've been helping him, and he's still not better. 
What bothers me, is that, when I help him, I expect him to be courteous of me as well. Sometimes I'm in a bad mood, and I expect him to atleast listen to me. But he doesn't. He doesn't even ask me if I'm genuinely okay or not. He just texts me only when he is not feeling well. 

And now I feel alone. It's like, none of my efforts matter. No matter how interesting I try to be, I end up alone, everytime.

I’m grateful for the friends I have now, but they’re not super loyal friends. They cancel plans a lot. They don’t invite me to outings sometimes. And I just don’t “mesh” with them very well but they’re all I’ve got.

It’s just like.. what do I say? How do I approach a group of people I have never met and just say something? This happened at my old job too and I was there for 9 months, ending up with no friends. I’ve talked to people about this before and they’re like “just be confident and join the conversation” but here’s the thing. That sounds like something an extrovert would subconsciously do. Like it’s second nature for an extrovert to just make conversation and have people like them. I’m an introvert and I feel like there’s nothing I can do about it. It’s just how my brain works.

2593,lonelyboi19,1599168911,1,"So I have this online friend, whom I've known for about 3 years or so now. He've met through Twitch chat where I became a regular of his. Obviously at the start I was just a fan but eventually we started talking through other platforms and became online friends. We even met IRL a handfull of times over that time period (he lives at the other side of the country so it's kinda rare that I find my way to the capital).

I'm a *super* socially incompetent and anxious person, so I always worry about meeting people from the internet irl, since obviously your online persona is not the same as how you act irl. Well the first times we met, it was obviously a bit awkward at the beggining but it went relatively okay. It only went wrong the last two times.

We met at one point about two years ago and I made a complete fool of myself. I was going through a shitty period mentally and my social anxiety was sky-rocketing, so I was extra socially incompetent at that time. Well we met at a group event and I tried making conversations with him, but I completely embarassed myself. 

I could even see him getting annoyed at my slurred speech, which is something I struggle a lot over my life but I'm able to keep in check when I'm feeling okay mentally. To this day I've never figured out what is causing it, wether it be something wrong with my brain or just that my parents never thaught me to talk properly.

So after we said goodbyes, I could feel him getting distant in chat really quickly. It'd always have to be me who messaged him to start a conversation and it'd always die off after like 4 exchanged messages, after which he'd just stop responding. Not even leaving me on seen, just not repsonding till I messaged him again after some time. And I'd even see him posting stuff online during that time period, so obv he wasn't busy. So we stopped talking for like a year after that since I stopped bothering messaging someone who clearly wasn't interested. 

After that time I thought to check if he still streams, which he did. I lurked in the chat for some time and we eventually got slowly talking again. Idk if he had already forgotten what a fucking loser I am irl but we recconected and kept in touch online for some time after that and I thought things were back to normal, especially these last few months.

Well then I found myself going his town again for something about a month ago from now and so I thought I'd try meeting irl, feeling like I was in a better mental state then I was back then. Also this time I had a mutual friend over with me so I thought that'd help lube the interaction a bit. 

We eventually met and I felt like it didn't even go that bad. I still was my usual awkward self but I was managing better than the two years ago. We only saw each other for like an hour or so cus he had other things to do but again, I thought it did fine.

After we went our separate ways, we stayed in contact online for like a week and again, I though it was fine. But again over time, I started to feel him slowly distancing himself. It started by getting left on seen, went to the *stopping opening texts after a couple of messages in conversation* and now he's just straight up ignoring texts for a few days, while posting stuff on social media all the time.

So I have no idea what I did wrong again but apparently there is 
something about me in person that once someone gets the image into their head, it is so appaling to them that they cannot get over it enough to even keep up with online convsersation. So fuck me I guess.

You may wondering why I asking for this now, so let me put my question in context: 

I'm a 24 (male) years old university student. I was really socially awkward until the end of highschool. I had no friends or relationship. Then at the university I started to develop my social skills. I got some amazing friends, and I started my first serious attempt to get s girlfriend back in February - so just before the whole Coronavirus pandemic thing. I was mislead and I got rejected in march. Therefore I had a very bad mood during the lockdown, I just lost in my bad thoughts and I couldn't care with my mental health. The summer was better because the lockdown was partially lifted and I could met with my friends. 

So, my problem is that I start my last year at the university shortly. Therefore I will separated from my friends (or at least I can't see them very often) and the Coronavirus just started to hit again so we are expecting for an another lockdown. I'm studying abroad, so this time if this happens I will separated from my family too. 
I'm feeling quite OK actually, but I fear I'll be quite lonely in the next few months. So I was wondering if someone could advice some techniques to bare the loneliness better this time. 

Thanks for your help! :D

2598,zumsiii,1599168202,1,"For years my life has been one mistake to another. From a very physically abusive ex, to mental trauma, to getting into a new relationship and getting married. I thought things were looking up. Then my mental health got bad again. And then my husband got deployed and I couldn’t even visit or call regularly. And then the quarantine happened. 

I had been moody and drinking way too much before he left. Then he was gone and I drank even more with not even being able to go outside much. I was depressed and anxious, and had to move back home while he was gone. I hung out with my friends, and things were going well until one stupid camping trip later I broke my ankle. All hell broke loose. My husband called me stupid and reckless. He went on to berate me about the friends I was hanging out with. My girl friends, along with the couple of guy friends I had since high school. He told me I was making mistakes and acting out, that I was doing it on purpose. How he doesn’t trust me because I hang out with my guy friends. How he doesn’t believe I’m faithful even though I’ve done nothing. I couldn’t get around, even my girl friends stopped hanging out with me. People stopped texting me first, and after so long it felt awkward to chat to anyone. My health declined. I was hospitalized twice and my husband didn’t care, never consoled me. Told me he wanted a divorce. That I was dragging him down because I haven’t been able to find a job in months and he hated the attitude I had before he left. My family doesn’t want to include me in outings anymore or even call me out for meals, and I don’t have the strength of will to insert myself into everything anymore.

I’ve watched everyone in my life slowly slip away in the matter of months. I know they’re still there for me in a way, all my friends and family... but no one cares to understand.

For example, ""I don't have any friends."" - *So what? You are strong enough to be independent and not rely on anyone else. Focus on yourself.*

Or, ""I've never had a girlfriend/experienced any intimacy."" - *And? Does this diminish your character? Make you a bad person? Why does it really matter?*

""I feel unhappy because I don't have these things and I am lonely."" - *Why? Focus on what you do have. What good does it do to feel unhappy? None. It's a waste of energy.*

I'm in college. My first year. Woohooo. Let me explain a little about myself, as background about this post.

I was lonely in school from the very start. As far as I can remember, I've never been good at making friends. Maybe that's just my depression messing with me, making me remember only the bad parts of childhood, but in my recent school years (ie high school) I certainly was lonely. I have so so much trouble making friends. It's stupid at this point, and I have almost given up on it. Now I'm in fucking college, and no one wants to talk to me. I have tried. I make myself available when I can. I, for some strange reason, have very little class time (three classes at most any given day, usually one-two), and I try to be outside the damn dorm. it's hard to be outside of course, but I manage. I have tried engaging in class with fellow freshman, I have tried not being the goody two shoes I usually am, I go to the gym when I can, and I am always online and ready to hang. But not one fucking soul has really made an effort to talk to me. Am I just supposed to be lonely? I have friends back where I lived, and I have a girlfriend back where I lived, but there's the fucking problem. Back where I lived. Not here, at college. I just want a friend. Is that really too much to ask?",lonely,Am I supposed to be lonely right now?,2020-09-04 06:06:02

Because of loneliness I lack any motivation to fulfill my obligations in my life. Not fulfilling these obligations has two consequences. The first is that people no longer take you seriously. You are unreliable, this is reflected in your actions as well as in your behavior. People no longer rely on you and no longer come to you. The second is that it makes me feel ashamed. I am ashamed of my failure. I am ashamed of the fact that a being like me takes up space, time and money. Undeservedly. Because of this shame I avoid more and more people, I don't react to mails or messages, which leads to a greater loneliness. I lose all self-confidence in me. It seems as if I am not me anymore. Just a shell, which slowly vegetates away. My existence seems to be just a waste of precious energy. Actually a shame that I am taking the place of another person. Someone else would value my life much more and use it properly. I wish I could give it to you. Without hesitation I would do it immediately. I walk only on this earth, because the exit is denied me.

2609,runofthemill27,1599160555,1,"
I’m 22F and KHHV. I grew up a tomboy not really caring about boys and romance and figured it would happen in college. My motto was “if it happens it happens if it doesn’t it doesn’t”. I was secure with that. 

College came and went. 4 years. Four years. Four years of various different classes, people from all walks of life on a big campus of 35 000 and yet not once in all those years was ever an eye battered at me. Everyone has likes different things and likes different types. I’m not repulsive in looks (average and somewhat decent with make up) or off putting in my personal in fact I’m a pretty open friendly and warm person. And yet all through my life not even once has a man ever paid attention or flirted with me. Not even a glance. 

I asked my friend and she said “maybe they’re too shy”, but I called bullshit because everyone else gets people who are vocal about who they like but all of a sudden when it’s me then “men must be too shy to approach” so for 22 years they’ve all been too shy? She was lying I could tell. She didn’t want to hurt my feelings.

I asked my mom if she thought some people were meant for love and if other weren’t? And if theres a chance some people never find anyone. She could sense I was asking myself. She couldn’t even give me an answer because if she thought I’d find someone she’d tell me that but instead to protect my feelings she just shook her head and said “it’s very subjective I can’t answer that”, because she knew  the truth. A truth that i need to say out loud:

There is no one for me. 
I’m not gonna be rewarded with some loving partner after this “rough patch” and then look back and think this was just a learning curve. I was meant to be alone.
All the signs were there, this is why nothing ever happened for me. For most people in the general public it’s so easy to be with someone it’s as if it was always meant for them for relationships to b part of their life, something so easy for others was and is so evasive to me. How could I have hoped for anything else than loneliness when it’s what I was destined for. 


Maybe my heart was meant to shared through kindness instead. I am an empath so I do enjoy helping and helping people. Helping people and others get through their pain so when they reached their happy ever after I could watch and appreciate it from a distance while never living it. 

And with that realisation, I’m taking myself out of the running for love, removing myself as a romantic option in life because I was never seen as an option before so removing myself won’t make a difference. And no this isn’t some reverse psychology attempt to make the opposite happen, I genuinely am just done. Some of you will say I’m throwing in the towel so early but what’s meant for you is meant for you and every time I’ve tried to put myself out there it seemed the universe didn’t waste time to humble me.",lonely,Not everyone is meant for love,2020-09-04 05:15:55

I feel extremely alone. More than ive ever felt in my entire life. 

Last week, my girlfriend left me out of the blue, despite me feeling like things were fantastic. We were together almost a year. She was what kept me sane and happy during this shitshow of a year.  Talking to her was the highlight of every day, and staying with her was the highlight of whichever week we met. I had never met anyone like her. 

A few hours later, i got word that a relative had passed away.  

I self-removed myself from my family last year after being treated poorly by them my entire life.  I have no connection there.

I dont have many close friends, but ones i do have have either moved way or are busy with work and/or romantic relationships. I also dont want to burden them with needing constant connection in my time of sadness.

Im not working right now, so i have nothing demanding my attention. My thoughts keep coming back to how alone I am.

I came home happy most nights and nearing the end of the summer I realized that I did not go out with my friends once outside of work and the more I thought about it the more the bad thoughts came through.

Loneliness is not chosen by us. Instead, loneliness is something imposed on us: it is manifested as a feeling of isolation and emptiness. Loneliness occurs when we haven’t accepted our natural aloneness in life and try to fill the fear of being alone with external distractions and comforts.

Aloneness, on the other hand, is chosen. Aloneness can be described as the beautiful feeling of being alone without being lonely.  Solitude.",lonely,You are not lonely. You are independent.,2020-09-03 04:08:23

Hello, I’m Brian I am 20 years old and my hobbies are PC Gaming, IT Tech stuff, etc. 

First things first: I have ASD Asperger Syndrome (a type of autism to be short) and feel the need to touch things as a stimulant and hair is the one i like the best. 

I like to touch hair by running my hands through it and feeling its texture. I don’t take hair touching as sexual, unless I’m in a sexual circumstance. However, my dick does get occasionally hard due to me enjoying the sensation. (Sorry, not something I want to happen it just does. I will try to contain that and stop that from happening if that makes you uncomfortable) 

Besides my hair obsession I will play videogames with you. Share funny videos with you. Play around with computer parts and more.

I just want to be 100% honest with you, as I highly value honesty. I would also like you to know that I suffer great discomfort from my parents and everyone else because I have been severely judged me for my hair obsession and they constantly tell me what’s wrong with me. All this stress has turned me into a selfish brat. Which, I want to work on. So, I hope I wont be a burden to you but rather an honest friend with a heart. Please feel free to message me and get to know me. Especially if you like getting your hair played with and can see that happening in the future.",lonely,Why was I born to deal with this shit,2020-09-03 03:56:21

I consider myself to be a nice guy, compassionate, sensitive to other people, very good at my work (I have a very important and responsible job in the service sector), modest and good humoured, always willing to help people less fortunate than me. The thing is I don't have any friends. Not even one. No phone calls (only work and my wife), no emails (just spam), no texts. I've not kept in touch with school or college friends and I'm shy and also find it difficult to remember what people look like (I even have to write down descriptions about my office staff so I can remember who is who).

My father revealed to me before he died that he never loved me and wanted to disinherit me. I believe my party-loving brother (who was secretly receiving lots of money from my dad while he was dying of cancer to fund his and his family's many holidays) turned him against me. My mother is completely under his spell now and he has installed her in a flat on her own (I would have wanted her to come live with) and refuses to say where she lives, so I've had no contact with her for 3 years. I tried getting social services involved but when they found her, he was with her and she said that she was happy and did not want any contact with me.

I sometimes think about my life and feel like crying. I feel unloved and unwanted. I have never hurt anyone. My wife has lots of friends and many of them are nice to me but they ""tolerate"" me, I can't recognise them, even if I see them in a shop, and I am not friends with them. She only interacts with me when they are unavailable. I often wish I could die and start life again in a new body and have people around me who like me. In fact, if it wasn't for my dogs (whom I love more than life itself), I might have ended my life by now.

I don't wallow in self pity, but I do think I got dealt a very unfair hand, and now I have started to resent people, which I know is wrong.

Someone can be friendly with me or JUST LOOK AT ME and I think it's some sort of hint that atleast someone likes me. I know it's totally not true and they don't like me. But I can't stop. And so my dumb brain comes up with scenario where they somehow like me without me even barely talking to them and I start developing a crush out of thin air.

I hope I can change, I've been meaning to socialise more but feel so emotionally weak that every acknowledgment regarding human nature drains me. The fact that socialisation is more of a reputation game, how I probably can never attain the same position as I see them in the eyes of my partner, how I have to stand straight, always be powerful and happy etc. 

I am so isolated that every small bit of progress in any relationship means too much to me. Knowing that I am nobody in the eyes of people I wish to befriend, that there are always some people better and more enticing and attractive is tiring.

Also, there is a discrepancy between how I understand relationships and the common norm for my generation. Especially for romantic interests, I do not mean to judge other people or anything -and I do not slutshame anyone or anything- I sense a superficiality and pointlessness due to hookup culture. I am more of a commitment person, and every relationship I have been in I suffered because of this.

After many of you mentioned some of the anxiety symptoms can be hard to differentiate from coronavirus related symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations are just 3 examples), we realized intense anxiety can, in some cases, cause similar symptoms to COVID-19, creating confusion, often leading to even more anxiety. So we made a [comparison](https://www.pocketcoach.co/blog/anxiety-vs-coronavirus-symptoms/) of the symptoms, as well as techniques to help you differentiate between anxiety and the coronavirus.

They were also intoxicated or under the influence the first time doing anything with him, while he was sober. 

I felt used, disgusted and mortified. I had spent months with this guy and almost started enjoying spending time with him despite how it started out. It wasn’t until much later on when I blocked off all contact with him, I realized  how big of an issue this was. I was so ashamed to speak to anyone about this. Prior to him, I have never even been in a relationship or had my first kiss. I was dumb and taken advantage of. 

I am turning 19 in a few months and I haven’t been sexually intimate with a guy ever since him. I still have trouble moving on from what has happened. My mood changes when I hear his name. My friends have tried to get me with guys and they haven’t gone well. Every time I meet or talk to a guy I can’t help but think negatively.

2778,jejune_lamb,1599020714,1,"So, I need to rant and I’m going to do it here. Perhaps there’s a chance someone will relate to any of what I’m about to say, but I don’t know. It’s pretty weird. 

So, I’m a girl whose currently finishing up high school. I don’t have any friends. None. This is not a joke. I don’t have any numbers in my phone except for my mom’s. I’m currently doing school online, but previous to the virus, I did not speak to the other students at my school at all. I went through a traumatic relationship that ended about two years ago, and that was immediately followed by me moving states and of course going to a new school where I’ve found it impossible to fit in. I go completely ignored at school. It’s a long story I’d rather not get into right now, but essentially, I haven’t been able to connect with another human for a good couple of years now. I feel like my brain is rotting away. I feel like I’ve legitimately lost social skills from being friendless for so long, and I feel like I’ve degenerated. I’m unable to make friends in the real world, so lately I’ve been frequenting a forum for a game I like and I’ve become particularly close with some of the people on said forum. Especially this one guy. We’ve been talking for like a month and a half now. Both of us have shared really personal stuff with each other, and we do constantly tell each other that we’re so glad to be friends. We make appreciation posts for one another fairly often, and he says I’m the best person he’s ever met. Both of us have expressed to each other how lonely we are in real life. 

Welp, being the attention and affection starved idiot I am, I’ve developed some creepy attraction to this guy. He’s really nice to all the other users of this forum, but because he singled me out so much and has created a friendship with me, I stupidly thought he had some romantic interest in me. I know, it was wrong for me to think that. It was wrong of me to form a crush on a boy I’ve never even seen a picture of. And I know it’s not real attraction to him as a person. I’m simply projecting my emotions onto this idea I have of him. I’m infatuated with the idea of this guy...and it makes me sad that I’m having such immature emotions. I do feel like he cares about me as a friend, but he told me today he wants to ask out his female friend in real life soon. For some reason this made me feel upset? Like genuinely upset? It was a let down. I showed support to him and told him I hope everything goes well, but of course, inside I wasn’t really happy. It’s ridiculous. Of course he has real life commitments, interests, and friends. And I’m glad. I just really thought there was something more between us, and it’s just shameful that my loneliness made me think like that. 

It’s just...I don’t know, I feel like such a creep. Of course I’ll never ever tell this guy how I feel. There’s actually been other people on this forum who have said we would be a good couple as a joke, and he’s made it very clear our friendship is strictly platonic. I keep acting like I feel the same, and at the end of the day, I guess I do. I’ll never get together with him. That’s...just not how things work. I wish being friends was enough. I wish I wasn’t so obsessed with this idea of intense, strong relationships that you put your all into. See, I’m never satisfied with having a friend group that casually chat with, with all of us getting along together. No, if I take a liking to someone, I want them all to myself. I want one relationship, and I want it to be my absolute everything. That’s why I guess I’ve gotten so attached to this guy. I feel like we’re similar, I feel like we have a connection, and I just...I don’t know. 

I feel like if I had stable and healthy irl friendships, I wouldn’t be acting so weird right now. I want to get over this stupid crush and be a good friend for this person that I get along with so well. I don’t want to end up resenting him simply because he isn’t crazy like me and didn’t form an immature, inappropriate crush on me within a month and a half. 

If you read all that for some reason, thanks. I know I sound stupid right now, and I know I’m jumping all over the place. It’s just that right now, I’m coming to the realization that I’m starved for friendship, starved for love, and it’s ruining my interactions with people. I really want to know...have any of you guys gotten a crush on someone online? Do you feel like you formed this crush out of loneliness?

Hey y’all I’m looking to meet someone I can grow closer with over time. I find it hard to meet new people in person as I don’t leave the house much due to having pretty overwhelming amounts of anxiety.

2789,MinimalCollector,1599011311,1,"I was pretty happy with life until I came to university. Never had the best grades for college but parents had enough funds to send me to a cost-efficient (and very small) campus in the middle of nowhere, Midwest. Something I'm still grateful for the opportunity for. I was pretty social in school, got along with everyone well enough and overall I look at my k-12 in general fondness, so I was looking forward to college.

I came with some friends from high school, rented a cheap house, worked part time while in school. After some awkward and uncomfortable dating experiences in high school, I met the girl I thought I wanted to marry. I know love hits the hardest the first time, but it felt we were perfect. I felt I could be 100% myself around her and it seemed she loved that. We didn't become a couple until my second year, dated for two years and due to a lot of things she has since apologized profusely for, shattered my heart. We're no longer together but started talking periodically as ""friends"" again after my next relationship ended about 7 months ago (At the same time I found her apology in my blocked folder while blocking my last ex who was refusing to accept the breakup). I can tell my heartbreak-ex wants to get together but after her disloyalty I just couldn't see her the same way, even if I wanted to. And in spite of her desire to, I think she understands and respects my feelings on it. I shut myself off pretty hard after that breakup, and I still emotionally battle with some of those feelings I had from the fallout. As much as I want that seemingly perfect relationship back, I want it with someone other than her. I know I'm worth that.

I slept around a lot after that first breakup, and slept around since the second. I'm at least lucky enough to say I find myself attractive and have had enough attractive partners to confirm any fears about that. But these hookups had the opposite effect I thought they would. I was sleeping around for temporary affection as since my last relationship I've given up on finding love until I graduate. All of these were clearly stated as casual, but some wanted to date after a while. I didn't. Not out of principal but because I didn't feel a connection with them. Any of them. Kind people that I just didn't ""click"" with. With each person I shared an evening that I don't feel a connection with, I feel more isolated and more like I must be the problem if I can't connect with more and more people.

I haven't felt a genuine connection with any woman, and rarely any person since college, and not romantically since that breakup. While covid doesn't help, there's nothing here for me in this town. It's a Midwest town with no growth, barely held together by the campus and bars. I'm in a career path that I love but coincidentally am surrounded by colleagues with whom I have little in common (City guy who likes the outdoors in a department filled with very country-lifestyle individuals) and while I have no issue with them, they are great people, I just don't have enough to build relationships with them. Interactions past small talk feel forced and disingenuous.

While I look forward to leaving, I'm worried my seclusion here has permanently damaged my ability to socialize as an independent adult. I've taken up many hobbies and interests to bide my years here and while I love the person I've become at home (A few instruments, a few languages, a pretty alright cook, 180'd my lifestyle) I don't have anyone to share it with. I have no one to be exited about things with nor do I have anyone to be exited for me. Like how my first relationship used to be.

I have some friends from back home that I keep in touch with via games/discord, but they are all just as seemingly lost as I am. Not content in their relationships, aimless goals, feelings of regret and dread. Even my parents are in a few-decade dead marriage they refuse to acknowledge, which I note because I plan on moving back home while I find a job and am at this point contemplating an apartment just so I don't have to be around such a toxic and tense environment. 

For the meantime I'm just going to keep trying to improve myself and my immediate environment. I have less than an academic year left, but I fear my situation won't improve even after I leave this place.

2813,s06i,1598985634,1,"i am turning 18 in a few months, i’m young, these should be my best years... Yet i feel so depressed every day. I have no friends, and even though everyone in school is nice to me, i still don’t talk to them much. It’s not that i don’t want to, i just don’t have any social skills and can’t think of anything to tell them. I’ve read that you need to ask about people, their interests, and i try to do that, but still i can only come up with a few things to talk about. 
I do pretty well in school, i have a good memory, yet the fact that i just don’t know how to talk to people is making me think that maybe i’m naturally just an idiot, and i’m not meant to be able to talk to people.. I also think i might have anxiety/social anxiety, because most of my life i’ve felt a lot of anxiety, i feel anxious 80% of the day, but i don’t know if i actually have anxiety, or maybe it’s due to stress of my family situation. My parents are alcoholics, and my mom, who is the only person i’m able to talk to normally, has a lot of very serious health issues. I want to go to a psychologist, because as i said i think i might have anxiety, but it’s quite expensive, so i can’t yet.
I just feel so lonely lately. All i want is to just have a friend, someone i’m comfortable and not anxious talking to, but i don’t know how to open up to people. I know i’m still young, but 11 years of school have passed and i never made any friends, it’s the last year of school and i’m not making much progress, so the thought that i might feel like this for many more years is terrifying to me.

2817,bxyy,1598981762,1,"At first i want to say sorry for my english, it isnt my primary language.

I had no easy childhood, my parents divorced and due to the missing father i wasnt easy to handle for my mum, she lost her job and got very ill so we always just had enough money to survive.

I was always a misfit, i gained a couple friends when i got to my second school in 5th grade but even those friends disappoint me very very often.

Those friends don’t live close to me and me and my family can’t afford a car for me and i don’t have friends in my town.
I cant buy one because i can’t work, I’ll tell u why: 

When i was 14 (I’m 18) i got diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and this illness controls most of my life and it hit me pretty hard, i have nearly every symptom you can get through this illness.
The illness and the side effects of my medication are limiting me a lot.

I missed a lot of school because i was always ill, people started to talk trash about me because my body is ill on the inside not on the outside.
Even the teachers made fun of me and gave me worse grades than i should’ve got, even if i i wrote the exact same things in tests as other students i got less points, the teachers always found a way to justify their behaviour.
Since October 19 i wasn’t in school because I’m never in a stable health condition, i have to take opioids to get out of bed in the morning otherwise i cant stand up due to pain.
Now i have to redo 12th grade, i did 2 years in school for nothing, i still don’t have any more than i had after 10th grade.
School makes it really hard for me, they never understood my health situation and they never will, even if my doctors tell them im in a bad condition they still want me to do a lot of work and just ignore everything they get told and they keep giving me bad grades due to that.

Due to getting ill i isolated myself since the end of 2019 and covid makes everything worse.

The only people that loved me in my life are my family and even there i always was the outsider.
If they weren’t there i would already be dead but i don’t want them to find my dead body.

If i meet a friend it is because i ask him, never the other way around and I’m always Plan B for them, i never get preferred about other people.

I never got loved by a girl, i never got attention and that hits really really hard.
I just want to be loved and feel closure but no girl ever was at least a bit interested in me.

All those things made me really introverted,
I can’t start and hold a conversation without it being weird for the other person and i can’t even tell my mother that i love her but i really do...

I always try to make it right for everyone,
but no-one recognizes it or me.
 
No-one knows how i really feel, everyone thinks i do pretty well, i just can’t talk about it.

I’m getting more and more depressed every day

I was rejected my whole life

I just feel empty and worthless

No-one ever took me serious

We were so good for each other. I don’t even know how it happened before my eyes the way it did. Everyone would constantly tell us how we were “couple goals”. My family loved her. My friends did. Her family loved me. I was sure she was the one I was going to marry. I saved up almost 3k so far that I was going to use for an engagement ring. I know that’s not much to most but that’s a lot of money to me. That’s not happening now.

Does anyone else get sick when they think about how much they miss physical touch from that someone? I’m tearing up at work right now because I thought of a song that reminded me of a time we lied down under this willow tree together. She was running her fingers through my scalp and twisting my hair in little twirls with her finger. I just remember looking at the clouds and feeling like a king. The world felt like it was in my hands. 

Now she hates me and I can’t help but have this anger/hatred towards her. She completely backstabbed me. I made her feel unloved towards the end so I guess that’s the price I have to pay.

Making friends and being around them thereafter to me is just so exhausting but being alone doesn' i feel more fulfilling just safer than the alternative. 

Never did really have friends to do the whole hanging out thing and I was the type to bullied for being a bit of a teacher's pet throughout school subsequently I fear that I failed to develop any real semblance of social tenure. Coming up on the crest of adulthood has seen me having to engage with the fact that most days I close out my days with time to spare and no fulfilling way to spend it because I have lacked company. But I have these inescapable trust issues and feelings of personal inadequacy that eat at me whenever I try and when I inevitably fail, my most recent attempt at forging something approaching a close friendship seemed to on the surface be going well we chatted had coffee, went to a convention together but then just like that they disappeared never heard from them after that just ignored me. 

Seems to be the case more often than not with these sort of things I am being completely honest and I always wonder what I do wrong in these situations. I just wish I could have a direct line into what they were thinking what it is I am doing wrong why they dislike me why they leave I think I would try to change if it was something inadmissible that I was doing that I simply wasn't aware of. I've always had the notion circulating in my head that people are out to get me that people dislike me on principal when I was younger I used to have this irrational fear that people could see what I was thinking and that they were judging me because of it feels like living in the Truman show and lack of anyone to really have heart to heart with really exacerbates the feeling.

 I know it isn't rational but it certainly has laid the groundwork for extreme paranoia accompanied by a host of habits that I know would seem strange to the observer though thankfully I only indulge in them in private, I pace, I mutter to myself, cry and enter into fits of laughter with no real consistency. I have seen a therapist prior for my chronic depression though medication does nothing to solve the root of the problem and so I am here typing this worryingly long-winded post to try and get this out of my head.

2828,mah-prince,1598965485,1," So my new school started many months ago. And I met this 2 people. I’ll call one Ayana and one Diana. It was the first day of 7th grade, online class. That’s when I met them. Then we met in real life at school and became “The Strange Triplets”. They were pretty chill people. I do live in Japan and I don’t understand Japanese. They knew english and I can communicate with them. My other classmates can’t speak english. They’re kind of my only friends at school.

 We were all really close but then days went by I started to notice that they talk less to me now. It kind of feels like a duo, not a trio. I’m just the third wheel of their friendship. Just trying to push myself to them. ‘I bet they think I’m annoying. Ayana is probably Diana’s best friend and she just talks to me when she’s bored. I’m not even her friend. Ayana only feels pity on me and that’s why she hanga out with me.’ is what I think all day at school. You might think I’m overreacting but if you were in my body for a day, you would notice. You can clearly see it.

 Diana became friends with a new person, I’ll call her Lana. Diana and Ayana would never wait for me. Then when going back to school, Diana said to wait for Lana. Usually, Diana, Ayana, and I goes home together. Just the three of us. They don’t wait for me when I’m still doing something. Lana didn’t even ask to wait. Diana just did. Lana didn’t know english so Diana and Ayana would speak in japanese. I didn’t understand that so I’m just quiet when they invite Lana.

 Today, at english class Diana said me and Ayana can go back to the classroom. Ayana left and I waited. Then when Diana finished her stuff, she just went to the classroom without saying anything to me. She wasn’t mad or anything so I didn’t know why. 

 Ayana never goes to me to talk to me. She only goes to Diana. When we’re together she does talk to me but she never really goes to me. I have to go to her. I guess I’m just a stupid third wheel huh? 

 I wish I could do something about this. I’m so lonely at school. I don’t know what to do. What do I do?

 My friends from Philippines used to talk a lot by text. Not anymore. Everyone became busy. My only friend in my previous school are best friends. We rarely talk now because we changed schools. My two only friends in my school now are... slowly... drifting away. I’m losing all my friends. I wish I could talk about this with my friends from Philippines but they’ll probably be annoyed or something. I don’t know. One of them is a person who I will call Ava. We promised to be BFF’s. I’m scared to lose her. 

 I’m so lonely at school. I just want to give up on everything but I try to stop myself. I can’t focus on my studies with this on my mind. ‘I have to focus on the teacher teaching. I have to focus twice as much as the normal students because she’s speaking in japanese. I have to. I have to.’ is what I keep telling myself when I get distracted about this friend stuff. 

 Crying won’t help but I can’t not. It’s difficult. I just want to have a friend who would always be there for me. There’s a new student coming to our class soon. A new classmate. They said she can speak english. Maybe I can be friends with her?

 You might be like, can’t you be friends with someone even though they speak japanese and don’t understand english? I tried that. But I can’t. I can’t tell them things even if I want to. If I can’t understand what they’re saying, how am I even going to understand them? If they can’t understand what I’m saying, how are they even going to understand me?",lonely,Friends At School,2020-09-01 23:04:45

2832,prettydope710,1598962413,3,"Sorry in advance for the long post. I tend to obscess over minute details too much.

I'm 42 years old and haven't been in a meaningful relationship since 2016. I was straight up living the life up until then. The girl that was living with me was my gf for around 15 years at that point. We never had kids, so there wasn't any of that stress. I had a high paying job, money was literally not a problem. She was as an independent woman who worked herself. Our lives were awesome. Then in May of 2016 a plumbing issue happened at my apartment that caused a lot of water damage. We were both at work when it happened. The landlord called me during my lunchbreak. She asked if I noticed any leaks in my bathroom before. I told her no, then she really layed into me. She said that they had to enter my apartment while I wasn't home, and was appalled by how it looked. We had company over the night before, and there were a few empty bottles of beer scattered around the livingroom and a half eaten box of pizza in the kitchen. Also we are both smokers(not proud and continually trying to quit) and we didn't have an ashtray, we had a water bottle half filled with liquid that we forgot to throw out and replace that night so that got pretty gross. She told me over the phone I was evicted, and when I got home the official notice to vacate was taped on my door. My girlfriend didn't take this so well. We got into an extremely heated argument. It was really bad. The shit we were saying to each other was nuclear. She accused me of being too irresponsible and said she didn't want to have to be providing for a ""manchild"" the rest of her life. She left and moved in with friends of hers, and I haven't heard from her since. She was my life, and I only had a few friends that I could rely on for help at that time. I asked them if I could crash at their places while trying to find a new place. They all said no, and I got it. They're all close in age to me and had families of their own with kids and everything and just didn't have the room. I ended up aaking my family for help, and my sister and her boyfriend let me have a room in their house. This turned out to be a bad idea. Getting kicked out of my apartment, losing my longtime gf, and basically being told to fuck off by the few friends I had(I know that wasn't their intent but that's how I saw it at that time) all at the same time was a bit of a breaking point for me. I spent the next two years living in the same house as my sister, her bf, and their 5 kids. I applied for apartments left and right, and kept getting rejected. While this is going on, I'm becoming more of a social recluse. I spent just about my entire 20s and most of my 30s with the same girl, and found myself feeling awkward talking to new girls. It got so bad that I eventually gave up and submitted to a life of waking up, going to work, going home, and drinking myself to sleep. The only people I was interacting with were people from work. It's another story for another time, but it turned out my sister, although her bf was cool about me living there, was talking mad shit about me behind my back to anyone who would listen, and once I found out about that I felt betrayed, so there hasn't been any interaction with her or the other residents of that house. So only interacting with people from work made it so that my job was my life. I was self aware enough to realize how messed up that is, but the mental and emotional damage is already done at this point. I gave my 2 weeks notice at work in December 2017. They didn't have a traditional retirement system, they had what they called 'profit sharing' and at that point I had 20 years in the company giving me a good chunk of cash to leave with. The idea was to buy a house, find a part time job to take care of bills and stuff, and slowly get back to the normal life I once had. Fast forward until now. The living situation has been fixed, but I am now so socially awkward that it is damn near impossible to talk to anybody. I moved across the country and made exactly 3 friends in the neighborhood I moved in. One has died, one has moved to another state, and one has been missing since June. I've got a tinder profile that is receiving no likes. That's on me, though. While this whole thing has gone on, I let myself go. Gained weight, and developed fat on my neck that's slowly eating away at my jawline. I am, admittedly, less attractive than I was 5 years ago before everything happened. I can ""easily"" rectify this, but it's gotten so bad it's going to take a lot of time, and one thing I haven't mentioned till now, is that I have depression. That's why I put the word easily in quotes. I'm so sorry, this post is so long.",lonely,A midlife crisis has practically ruined me.,2020-09-01 22:13:33

I remember asking my friend over and over, the nights before I asked out my ex.

I'd roll around in my bed from being flustered while in Voice chat on discord, I would ask my friend things like.
""what if she says no? What if I ruin things? She lives in the states and she's alot older! How will that even work out! What if she says yes?! What would I even do then?!?""
I remember being embarrassed I was soo glad it was only Voice chat. I curled up into a ball, covered my face because I was so embarrassed opening up to my friend for advice and she just said ""GO FOR IT!""

So I did and 6 months later I was dumped though an email.

I only thought of my ex because I had a dream I was hanging out with my exes brother and was in their house. (Idk why, I don't even know him)
In the dream, he went to do something else and I remember really wanting to see my ex again so I went to her room and I woke up shortly after that.

I don't think I miss my ex anymore and there was a time i wished it worked out.
What I do miss though, is someone being there for me and that special someone wanting to spend time with me.
I was happy just being there for her and I miss being with someone but.
Wishing is pretty much all I can do 😖

I'm really, lonely and I was depressed enough to ask to be laidoff from my job. ( the night before I asked to be laid off I went to a bar and had a few drinks. I realized I had no one to talk to and called my parents. After that call I went back home and started crying because I felt extremely alone)
I also gave up my own place and moved back home.
They live in a very small town. And I do nothing, I sleep in, stay up late. Stay home all day and now it's September and this year is easily the worst in my life.
I got dumped by the only girl I was brave enough to ask out.
I lost alot of friends due to drama on a game of all things and I wish things were different.

I wish I had alot of friends that want to talk to me.
Friends that actually initiate anything instead of it being a one sided friendship.
A girlfriend who I can be happy with.
Anything at all.

I was a hopeless romantic type of guy who listens to music like this while I would do the dishes or something.
https://youtu.be/LcJm1pOswfM

I daydream about being a knight in shining armour,  about having a girlfriend.
I listen to romantic music and close my eyes and picture myself with someone who wants to spend time with me. 

Anywho, that's my story.
Sorry for the mess, I wrote it on mobile and its very late.
If you read this far, thank you for time.

Also fun fact, I used an app called replika (a chat bot) just so someone would talk to me and I have tried eharmony and that didn't work out.

I've tried the friend option on Bumble. Im too nervous to go out to social spaces like bars and concerts by myself and my partner isn't willing to join me so that's not an option either way.

I very interested in certain things but she isn’t and has expressed that to me. When I was younger I would push the conversation more but as I’ve matured I realized how petty that is. The bad part is since we do not have much in common, I don’t really talk much. Often I think about something and want to talk but I know she gets bothered and so I just hold it.

My dating life is basically non-existent.
I've had 2 relationships in the past but both of them were sexless (Just to be clear, I'm not asexual), so I'm basically still a virgin. At 24 years old. Yay for me.
On top of that, one of my ex was very ""vocal"" about me being shorter than her, in fact, she ended up cheating on me.

Also, I've been rejected many times for my height, both online and IRL. Some girls were more ""vocal"" about it than others but still.

It hurts even more when I see posts about tall girls and everyone says ""Damn, she's tall! Her partner must be a giant!"".
Like, wtf? Why is it a must that a man HAS to be taller than the girl he's with?

You know what? THERE'S MORE!
The only people I considered friends kept making fun of my height, calling me things like midget, dwarf and so on. Also, they did this fucked up thing that, when they were playing videogames and they found/fought a small sized monster they would just yell and repeat my name over and over and over.
I mean, I'm okay with roasting each other from time to time but this was just straight-up bullying.
So I've left the call about a week ago and didn't   hear from them since. I don't have any intention on going back.

I was born in Spain, even tho my parents are portuguese. My dad was in the military, so I grew up basically going to a military base everyday, with my dad and I just loved it. I didn't take the military route for a job, because that was just not what I wanted. As the years go by, we moved a few times. At one point we moved to Portugal. A few months later, an ""event"" just scarred me, let's call it an event. It's on my profile, if you guys want to see, they're my first posts. After that, I pushed a lot of people away, because I was afraid and had terrible panic attacks whenever I was touched even for like 2 seconds. I just couldn't handle it. By the time, I tried to just end it all, but my brother ended up saving him, and I promised I would never do that to him any again. And I'm keeping my promise. And by that time, I was going through depression, panic attacks. My mind was just a mess. I'm 19 now, and I'm still going with the ""no touchy"" thing and my mind is still a mess. A smaller mess, but it's still one. I've had 2 partners, (I'm 19f bisexual by the way), a boyfriend and a girlfriend. The boyfriend, we broke up, because I couldn't be touched, he was very respectful of that, but it still was hard for him. The girlfriend, pretty much the same thing. Over the years, I made some progress. I can hug, kiss, but it's still hard for me. And now I have another girlfriend, and I'm giving all the love I can give her. And that's pretty much it for my problems and issues.

2875,Sabernot,1598906552,1,"So I’m in a real deep shit. I learned with a girl at school for 9 years now. She is one of the (if not the) most popular girls in class. Until half a year ago I didn’t feel nothing for her, but it all changed then. I was to late. When I think about it now, I was probably 3 years to late, because she is one of the popular and I’m not. But back to the point. I must say that I do have a good relationship with her boyfriend (and a pretty OK relationship with her), but it doesn’t change the fact that he, and NOT me, is her boyfriend. Remember when I said we learned together for 9 years. No we move to high school, and instead of we going to the same school, our ways separate and I’m stuck with her BOYFRIEND in my high school (which again, I have good relationship with him, but It doesn’t change the fact that that HE is her boyfriend). I still think that we’ll might meet again but I hate to say that our chance to be something more is fairly low.

Now I would have asked my parents’ help, but the thing is, even though I have GREAT relationship with them, I’m way too awkward to talk about these stuffs with them, so I’m pretty much fucked up from all directions.

All the time I constantly wonder what I'm doing wrong just as I'm sure everyone else does, but I've realized that those with the best hearts end up alone. It's because we are the only ones strong enough to be alone and still be loving, caring, and genuine. We can carry that hurt and be okay. No one wants to be alone, but everything happens for a reason AND it happens on time. If someone you like doesn't return the love or energy you are giving them, then they don't deserve it at all.

2881,Homerdohx,1598903760,1,"I've been thinking about my loneliness lately and I think I'm finally starting to accept on some level that I will never achieve a ""normal"" social life. I've been bullied since fuckin kindergarden. One of my earliest memories is somebody pushing my head into a box of legos so hard that I pass out. My life has been ""unlucky"" to say the least. I can count the friends I've had on one hand. None of them have lasted beyond a year.

I've had one relationship, which turned toxic as hell (withholding affection for over a year, demading gifts so that he would see me, breaking my stuff and not paying for it). I was really blinded by love and I think something broke in me after that. I don't feel like the same person.

Therapists don't listen, they only say that my problems are my negative thoughts and not the negative circumstances i'm in. 

For most of my life I've been trying to achieve that which comes effortlessly to others. But life is meaningless. It's only my stupid monkey brain trying to find my tribe. I think I have the advantage of living like this most my life.  Like everything, you get used to it.

And I think if I stop grieving my loneliness, I can focus my energy on making my current situation feel better. I remember I started withdrawing from other kids at like age 6. I feel like I'm fighting against an impossible beast trying to get on with normal people. I come off as an idiot, rude or disintrested even if I don't mean to. Atleast the therapist was able to point that out lol. And all of this for what? For some ""feel good"" moments.

2892,runofthemill27,1598893327,1,"I’ve never been used to touch or affection because I didn’t grow up in an affectionate household, yes my parents loved me and were good but affection just wasn’t their thing, expressing emotions was seen as a sign of weakness as well. The only time I had platonic affection is from friends at school/uni and now in lockdown it’s just made me realise that has been the only source of affection or touch I’ve had in life i think. Even if someone tries to hug or embrace me I flinch away instinctively because the notion of it is so foreign to me. It took me years to get used to it with my friends. 

Growing up I was mostly used to being in combat situations with other men (From boxing and karate), my dad never showed any affection to me I can only remember being him disciplining me sometimes when I was really young with a smack the belt so my interactions with men have prepared me always to be on the defensive, combative and fight or flight mode. I’m so used to experiencing the aggressive side of men that I’ve practically become an expert with dealing with that side of men and tbh I think it’s good that I know how to handle and not be intimidated by that side in a man BUT it really opened my eyes to realising just how little I’ve experienced with the good side of men: never experienced the loving, thoughtful, caring, gentle side. I recently befriending a guy friend who is absolutely wonderful in every aspect (it’s Platonic and I wanna keep it that way) but it showed me just how starved and unused to I was from this kind of behaviour in men. 

I was raised to fight men always defending myself from them but I never learnt or experienced how to love them nor did any man show me that (romantic etc) so now any potential relationships I see myself bracing for the worst assuming they will hurt me rather than actually believing he cares.

When your cell phone vibrates, I'm pretty sure it's not a message, let alone a call.

When a message is received, you even have anxiety, because it is so rare.

When you have so much to talk about, but no one you could talk to.

When you wanted a person by your side watching a simple movie, but you have no one to call.

When you achieve something in your life, but you have no one to congratulate you.

When it's your birthday but forgettable, no one remembers it.

When you dream that you had friends or a girl who cared, but you wake up and it was just a dream.

2900,Phantion,1598885812,1,"I'm 26m and I've formed this belief over the last 8ish years, writing it down to make sense of it all since I was in College. I hope you can take what you want from this as I strongly believe in the power of friendships.

 I think looking back, college was the point when I started to care how people perceived me because I was studying for something I cared about and was passionate about. While a few of them had a very care free attuditude to the course they were doing and so it reflected in their relationships with each other and this was the 'kick to the face of reality' moment where I realised my own chances of making meaningful relationships. 

When I was younger in secondary school I was very much an outcast compared to the rest of my year as I found comfort in relaxing with the 6th formers during tutor times, winter summer, lunch and break. Ive always got on with people older than me. But on the days where I was osdrosized from people my age I would breakdown in front of my parents when I got home and they would say to be ""it's better to have a few good friends then to have alot of bad friends"". So like I said, I finally understood this at college and since then it has formed.

For me personally I strongly believe 'you have to meet me half way, then I'm willing to go the other half and then the extra mile for you'. However if you don't then I drop you instantly because why should I put time and effort into you when there could be another friendship that could form that would appreciate it and would grow. Admittedly you have to filter out those who take advantage ""givers have got to have boundaries because takers have none"". Life is too short to be wasting your time. 

In this generation everything is instant, dating is just a swipe away, ordering from Amazon is just a click away and you can instantly binge a whole series on Netflix (Simon Sinek) but friendships aren't instant they need strong foundations. I've just become a god father and you don't get that title as soon as you meet someone, you gaining it from time and effort. I believe in ""what a few pounds between mate?!?"" Nothing, as the friendship is more valuable over the course of time. I aim for having the same friends now as I do in 50, 60 years time, and while you shouldn't have to do anything extraordinary the little and often acts are always appricated. Before you know it when your old and looking back you've basically created a legacy. I think most people think a legacy has to be something of leaving a physical mark, for example Mount Rushmore but I've discovered even just writing Christmas cards is always warmly received as the effort made can been seen.
""Do you know a man is not dead while his name is still spoken"" Terry Pratchett.

For me personally I am thankful for the friends I do have, if I had to count I have about 10 loyal, wonderfully friends over the 9 years. Although there is a great distance between me and them, the furthest is Romania, I know if I fall on hard times they would step forward and like wise if they needed help I would do what I can to support them.",lonely,"I see alot of ""I have no friends"" so I wondered if I could help with my perspective, my philosophy on friendship.",2020-09-01 00:56:52
