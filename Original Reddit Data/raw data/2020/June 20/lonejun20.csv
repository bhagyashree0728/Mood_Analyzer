3,tyarados,1593519335,1,"As far as I remember I'm always the one chasing my friends and keeping our 'friendship' still. If I don't invite to do something, they never invite me. If I don't initiate chat, they never chat me. I don't mind that because my friends are mostly introverts and prefer to stay home (just like me). But after years doing that, I realise things never change. It was always me who initiates, who ask how they are doing in life. It really hit me, when my 'bestfriend' ignores my chat often, when I mean ignores, she postpone to reply my chat (you can see people online in whatsapp) for days, or just never read my messages. And before anyone saying ""she's probably busy"", yeah this happen everytime, I think since a year ago.

I do wonder about it sometime. I sometime sounds cold and say anything on my mind, but I used to have no problems making friends and I know they enjoyed my company as well. 

But why can't I have a normal friendship like everyone else? How do I achieve intimacy in a relationship where they actually wants to keep me in their life? Just what is wrong with me? I hope people just told me to fuck off instead.

Anyway, I am tired of chasing them now. I still think them as my friend, I would be glad if they reach me and always ready to help. If they forget about me, that's fine too.",lonely,Keeping 'one sided' friendship,2020-06-30 22:15:35

5,ssprue20,1593515247,1,"Over the past month, I have been feeling better bit by bit. I like my new job as an English Teacher in Japan, I am still writing and creating films. I finished my experimental short film on COVID 19 last Saturday and I am really happy with how it came out. All of this I can be able to do all because I am alone. It is just me here. Paying my bills, cooking my own food, driving to work etc. There are always ups and downs to being alone. I'm not gonna lie I still think about the possibilities of sharing what I am capable of, as well as my dreams and goals with someone else but at the same time I'm not sure. Sometimes I find solace in my loneliness and at the same time I don't. It feels conflicting. Having a relationship requires sacrifices and I can't sacrifice my art. My art saved me from my suicide attempt, saved me from my depression, and I would rather die if I sacrifice that. I would say that I didn't make my attempt because of the people who care about me, but its really because of my curiosity of whether my characters would have their revenge, or find their loved ones, or experience something life changing or something awful. My writing still sucks but I'm still doing it. The point is I don't know if my loneliness or even thinking of meeting someone is because someone else has someone, or because I am just naturally a social creature from a biological perspective. I don't even know if I am making any sense but my point is I don't know what I want anymore.  I don't know if I want to meet someone and that is what scares me. Not because other people have it but because life is short and I am afraid of at least not experiencing it. Time is such an enemy. With my job and my art and other stuff it feels impossible to even put in the time. I certainly know if all I have now goes away I will go back to being that insecure person thinking he is not good enough.

11,d0902987,1593508163,1,"I don‚Äôt know what to say. I made what I thought would be a good friend and was talking with this person for around two months(?) every night. On the phone. We went from Reddit to skype and chatted for hours. Of course I grew feelings. I was stupid and said I love you. He basically said, in short form, that it was too soon. I respected that. He confessed to liking me too. Afterwards he said that he had a tendency to shut everybody out when he‚Äôs not in the mood to talk and is upset. Even though my top pet peeve and tear triggerer is being ghosted, I didn‚Äôt think about it because I liked him so much. I cherished his company. But of course that didn‚Äôt last.. none of my close relationships seem to. Slowly he began pulling away. Not calling me unless I called first. Or not answering the call at all. Especially since he made a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with me saying, ‚ÄúAs long as you call, I will answer‚Äù ,it bothered me. I had and still was taking anti depressants. He knew this. I asked if we could depend on each other for company and he agreed. I thought we could connect on the fact that we had both been hurting. I needed him. A real connection. Because my parents pay me no mind, I have no siblings, and I have no notifications from friends or family ever. But during our last conversation, one of his last points to me was that he was not responsible for my happiness. Which stung. I never asked for him to have the burden of being my ONLY source of happiness. But if you make a deep connection with someone, you can‚Äôt be completely oblivious to knowing that you do bring that person some form of joy, right?! So why is it okay to go awol? Spoiler: it is not. 

Fast forward to tonight. He stated that he was depressed and proceeded to ghost me for a week straight. It angered me. I absolutely despise this sort of lack of communication. I‚Äôve been thrown away so many times in my life over and over. And I was hoping very much that he would be the one to break the cycle. But I was wrong. Instead of coming to me and explaining what was going on in his life he just did not talk to me at all. We‚Äôd had arguments before, and what I hated about disagreements with him is that he always had this unbothered attitude. Like ‚Äúhe had no time left in his evening to deal with my foolishness‚Äù sort of attitude. It broke my heart. Basically I was upset so I texted him, I‚Äôve never really cursed before meeting him but this made me swear. Just the whole crappy situation, the repetitive build up of being ignored way too much in my life boiled over. Long story short, he again seemed unbothered. He blocked me. So our companionship, relationship, whatever, is over. 


Ugh! I just want to meet a normal, caring guy! A guy that isn‚Äôt going to ghost me. A guy that will care enough to include me in his day.. a guy that is affectionate without it being one sided from just me. üòû im not asking to be together every second of the day. I‚Äôm not asking to fall madly in love with me. I‚Äôm not asking for perfection. I‚Äôm not perfect, no where near it.

I‚Äôm in a room full of people, some i know and some I don‚Äôt. everyone‚Äôs chatting and having a good time... everyone but me. i‚Äôm just there. no one wants anything to do with me. it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm a ghost, practically invisible. no one seems to care about my presence.

after a while of feeling like shit bc I‚Äôm alone, a group of guys approach me. happy bc it turns out I‚Äôm not invisible after all, i‚Äôm excited to be noticed by someone and start talking to them. the guys start cornering me and they start making sexual remarks about my appearance, and how they would like to do certain things with me. i start feeling highly anxious and helpless. soon after, the guys get physical with me. the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of the gang starts kissing me, others try to touch me or grope me, and i can‚Äôt help but stand there in shock. absolutely paralyzed with fear, like a deer in the headlights. everyone else in the room act like nothing is happening, they don‚Äôt even turn to look at us. as if they couldn‚Äôt care less what is happening to me. helpless, i just stand there and let them do what they want.

once they decide they‚Äôre done with me, they throw me to the ground. they start calling me a slut, a whore,  a prostitute. they tell me how im never going to be loved, and that guys only look for me bc they want sex, but otherwise, no one would ever fall in love with a whore like me. they leave, leaving me in the ground. feeling used, scared, and alone. no one saw what they did to me. or at least they didn‚Äôt care to notice.

the only redeeming part of the dream was when another group of people enter the room, my best friend among them. he sees me, not even realizing how terrible I look. he comes over to me and greets me, giving me a big hug. it was exactly what I needed, and I just wanted to stay there, as it was the only support I had. but then, his friends call him over and they leave. leaving me alone. again.

not able to take it anymore, I wake up and i break down in a sobbing mess. hahaha even writing this makes me feel like curling up in a ball and cry even more. idk if anyone is going to read this. i just wanted to vent.

Quarantine has been difficult for most. From not being able to enjoy their favorite stores, to not being able to hang out with loved ones; It's been a tough road for the most of us.

But for me: It's just normal.

Growing up, I wasn't allowed out (or consequences would be had.) I didn't realize how bad it is at home until recently. Then it all made sense.

I won't go into detail, but one thing that helped me cope was pacing back and forth in my house for hours on end. I do this daily even now. When doing so, it becomes like a tranze. You daydream and when you walk, you start to see the daydream rather than the four walls of your livingroom.

I didn't go out. (I was made to believe I was introverted.) So I invented friends. I would have imaginary conversations with them and I would invent characters. These characters became so elaborate that I would cry when I killed them off. I would anxiously leave school and continue the pacing ritual so I could talk to them.

Though, this may sound absolutely insane to most, it helped me cope with abuse I didn't realize was abuse.

Apart of me wishes I could have been a normal child, but apart of me knows I wouldn't trade my gift for the world.

I visualize the worlds I create in my head. And when I put some intimate thoughts on paper, people tell me it's magical.

I don't know if I will ever publish a book. Because I'm scared someone will try to steal the only thing that kept me sane all these years. My voice. It's the only thing that I have left. No one can take that away from me.

48,JaredPhinley,1593477626,1,"I'm a teen and I feel empty. Dead inside. No real emotions. The few people I sometimes have a good time with I wouldn't even call them friends, because the relationship is superficial, we barely know each other and meet just for the sake of fun itself. I barely feel emotions. I can't recall the last time I was truly happy, ragingly angry, or devastatingly sad, the last time I cried of joy or sadness. I live my days in a silent and constant state of nothingness, a limbo. My face smiles but it's more of a reflex movement that I automatically know I have to do when the situation requires it than a honest emotion manifestation. 

I don't know what triggered this, if I made this. People say that teens always tend to amplify everything five times more, their emotions, their actions, that they make everything more important than it is, but boy I wish I was like that. The fact is that I don't care about anything, I feel everything's so pointless and with no real meaning. We grow up, go to school, find a job, a wife, settle up, get old, retire, get grandchildren and die. They say the key is to enjoy the happy moments and to embrace the sad ones, but I just can't. I want to, but can't, I don't know how. 

I don't know what to call it and I hate bringing this up because it makes it seem bigger than it is and nowadays people also tend to tell these kinda thing all the time so I'd look like a drama queen. Bitching about these kind of feelings is kind of a trend for teens who love to overdramatize. The ""I'm not like the others, I'm different"" kind of stuff.

I see all my fellow teens doing their stuff, going out in clubs, drinking at parties to death, making friends like a McDonald's employee makes fries, socializing andit confuses me so much, psychologically they seem like aliens to me. Whenever I happen to go to a party or something I always feel awkwardly misplaced. I'm not sad or anything as said but I really wouldn't mind if a bus suddently hit me straight in the face. I don't even know why I'm writing all this here on reddit where all I can get is ""I can relate to that"" or ""just do it"", I don't know, maybe I just needed for someone to know.

All I know is that this mindset isolated me from everyone and I find myself now really alone, because of the weirdness of this situation that I believe nobody could really not misunderstand but I don't want to be like this.

64,username2J,1593463977,3,"My older brother tries to include me more in stuff. I guess it makes since he walked into my room with a bad over my head. But honestly I‚Äôm just comfortable alone. Especially when I take that stupid substance which is marijuana. I envy the people that enjoy it but when I‚Äôm on it, in that social setting I was yesterday I just couldn‚Äôt talk. I couldn‚Äôt talk. There were conversations going on around me and I‚Äôd just blank out into my own head thinking about so much stuff, and then when my brother ask me something I just give a quick response but a very quiet one. Like very very quiet, I don‚Äôt like who I am when I take weed, I feel so uncomfortable in public so uncomfortable. 

And then how I react when I am asked something like I have no time to prepare and my ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù long distance of course, is asking me why I wasn‚Äôt talking but I didn‚Äôt want to deal with that yet. Me and her had this talk so many times about how I get upset over anything even though I don‚Äôt talk to her as much as I used to because it‚Äôs hard without feeling this awkward feeling, and when I take weed or get ‚Äúhigh‚Äù in public cause I had very few good highs when I‚Äôm alone in my room, everything feels so forced and uncomfortable. And I‚Äôm grateful that she tries to talk to me, she even said she‚Äôs bad at starting conversations but I‚Äôm worse. 

Anyways back to my older brother, I want to stop hanging out with him like it‚Äôs nice that he‚Äôs including me but for one his friends is not the type of friend group that I would actually like to be friends with but the thing that gets me so much about last night is that, whenever I would respond after taking weed it‚Äôs like my voice is so quiet and low, I have my voice speaking constantly in my head and then when it comes to actually speaking I just can‚Äôt do it.  When I reached the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù of that high all I wanted to do was go home so I can type about how much I dislike weed. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to get out of it, I don‚Äôt know how to tell my brother that I don‚Äôt want to hang out anymore and he has these little ideas but really they just feel forced. It‚Äôs good that he‚Äôs inspired to make videos and skits and stuff but the way I see it, is that you have to let it come to you and you can‚Äôt watch something and get inspired to do that thing so many times, it feels like the most forced thing ever to me and I don‚Äôt have any dedication in it. These guys (my older brother and his friend) has these little ideas but honestly that‚Äôs it just little ideas, I rather them only focus on their life instead of meeting up every weekend including me in just to make some story they made up when they were high come to life.

I just want to be alone, and do my own thing. And my own thing is getting upset about every little thing because that‚Äôs my purpose in life, that‚Äôs how I feel. I‚Äôve gotten upset at my ‚Äúgf‚Äù because she always talked about what her friend said, she would send me screenshots of the messages between her and him, and she told me many time that she likes me and I believe her but it‚Äôs that thing that I feel like no matter how much I explain no one would understand. That thing that I lost, that talkative stuff I had when I first met her because I had the fresh start I guess. And right now I‚Äôm texting this instead of texting her because I feel like it‚Äôs just been stale conversations kinda. And I just can‚Äôt do it. Like yes I would like to go on a real date with her, but that‚Äôs unlikely to happen. It would be more likely to happen if my parents moved to Florida which they were talking about but I can‚Äôt be optimistic. 

Something happened in 2018 throughout my high school experience that just changed my mindset on things forever. And that thing that happened I brought onto myself. Someone else who I talked to that now blocked me on a bunch of my spare accounts told me how ‚Äúmisery‚Äù is self imposed and I ruin every conversation by uncontrollable self loathing and it‚Äôs true. But my god I just don‚Äôt know how people live life not thinking so much like this. I was the innocent quiet kid in middle school but I still loved middle school compared to high school, and I had my great middle school friends that I don‚Äôt talk to now. After 2018 I avoided everyone and I wouldn‚Äôt talk unless someone talked to me, I lost my friends and I gave up on every social activity. I graduated on a zoom meeting a couple of days ago and I remember when my parents were looking through the yearbook but didn‚Äôt see one picture of me. Because I never went to take a picture for the yearbook. 

If I go to college I feel the fresh start feeling of a new experience would kinda bring me back on track socially, or I hope I don‚Äôt fucking know. But ugh man I just can‚Äôt get out of the rut and now my ‚Äúgf‚Äù is texting me, and idk what to tell her, I know she wants to have actual conversations like before but now I just given up on all of it, or just gotten so lazy that I don‚Äôt want to talk even though I don‚Äôt know how to fucking talk. Or that I‚Äôm scared of getting too emotionally attached to her, and then something I see I‚Äôll take the wrong way and make her upset and then I‚Äôll have to tell her again, for a break/ break up because I‚Äôm just so mentally unstable or something.

But I certainly feel older at times. Last year, in my pain and confusion, I fell prey to a bout with limerence (wouldn‚Äôt wish limerence on anyone!)

I realized in the last year or two (after all my wife‚Äôs affairs started coming out), that I was deprived of validation, affection, respect, nurturing, all sorts of important stuff had become lacking or missing in my marriage. 

Loneliness SUCKS!!! 

I‚Äôm not too thick to realize that I‚Äôm ‚Äòrich‚Äô and ‚Äòblessed‚Äô to even have a lifeboat and support system of friends and family that many others may not have as much. 

Still, that doesn‚Äôt invalidate the heartbroken loss of betrayal and rejection/departure of ones best friend and spouse for so many years. It hurts like hell, and is at once both angering, saddening, and scary. 

Trauma SUCKS too!

Anyways, venting rant over.

185,ItCouldNeverBeMe,1593362367,1,"So I‚Äôve got great friends, but after high school we all went to different universities. I was always invited to parties/ get togethers in high school. I was deputy head of school (votes were done by students not teachers). I have always been nice to people and people find me super funny. I even have a small YouTube channel that keeps people/friends begging for me to upload more. 

Now here comes the problem.

I didn‚Äôt get into the public uni I wanted to go to in 2019 but my parents let me go to a private one in the same city. Lots of my friends went overseas and others went to different unis in other cities. The private uni was expensive and the private accommodation everyone I knew from high school (friends from different schools in the same town) was going to was also a bit pricey so I stayed at a different accommodation. 

The reason I wanted to stay in the one accommodation so badly was because that way I‚Äôd be able to build better friendships with people I know and I wouldn‚Äôt feel left out even though we didn‚Äôt attend the same uni. (I‚Äôm not joking when I say EVERYONE from my high school Town was staying there) 

2020 I got into the uni I had been rejected from in 2019 and was so excited because I was finally gonna get to expand my friendships but also interact with people I know. (2019 private uni had a different calendar so making plans was hard). 

Reality eventually sunk in when people I had known for years made plans in front of me without asking if I wanted to join. I extended my 2019 lease because I hadn‚Äôt made good enough friends that year I wanted to share an apartment with and my other friends had made friends they wanted to share apartments with. So yeah I was alone, stuck. The friends I had made in the place I stayed in 2019 were moving across country or moving into apartments. 

I have never felt loneliness like I have in 2020. Why have I failed to make new friends in uni? Why have I failed to keep the HS friends I had? I‚Äôm the friend that always provides advice, support but no one ever gives me that because people always assume I‚Äôm okay. To make an example, end of 2019 my cousin was murdered and I didn‚Äôt tell any of my friends because I didn‚Äôt want to make them feel uncomfortable. I kept it a secret for 2 weeks until I had to mention I was going to my cousins funeral. 

Before corona hit I spent my weekends watching friends go for sundowners, lunch, party, hangout and visit the beach while I sat in my bed. Basically I just want to hang out with people. Do fun things with people. Not always have to work around other peoples busy social lives. 

I‚Äôm grateful for the life I live. The friends I have- even if they are far away. I‚Äôm just really lonely and it really hurts because I‚Äôm sure people would never guess that this is how I‚Äôm feeling because of what high school was like. 

This is the only place I could let out what I‚Äôm feeling because I don‚Äôt talk to my family about emotional stuff. That‚Äôs not because they are not supportive but it‚Äôs because I try so hard to paint this ‚Äòhappy‚Äô picture all the time. 

I just want to be included, that‚Äôs all.",lonely,I just want friends to hang out with. I‚Äôve gone from being surrounded by people 24/7 to having no one to even go to lunch with.,2020-06-29 02:39:27

188,utkarshh,1593358343,1,"Hello reddit! I am M 17 from India and I want you to give this a read.

Ever since I was young, I was always a smart and caring child. I had wide range of interests from sports to history and what not. I changed 5 schools during my lifetime and because of this i am really adaptable. I am socially confident and can easily make friends. But due to changing schools this many times I was never able to bond really well with anyone. And due to not having any best friends I have always been alone and tbh I like being alone. Its easy its comforting. I like to say I am alone but not lonely because I thrive when alone. Other people get bored but I will read a book or read articles and drink coffee and have fun in my own company. But the problem in my situation is that when i am having a rough day there is no one I can share my problems too. I have friends. Very god friends at that i am outgoing and love having fun. But due to me liking being alone I have always had trouble trusting people. I am not insecure. I just don't think people will help me for the world is a cruel place. I have seen some rough times I guess that's why I unconsciously developed this philosophy. I call myself a socially confident introvert. Its not like I have trouble talking to people i just prefer not to. The last two years have been extremely rough for me. New school, science student and too much pressure. My parents love me and I love them they have done a lot for me but they were not good at parenting and it will be an understatement to say that there parenting ruined my sanity. They have always unconsciously hurt my feelings. Since childhood I was  beaten. They were never used to console me when i scored bad marks. They were only happy when I scored good. Not there is a problem with that but something related to this made me extremely distant from them. If you are only with a person in their good times are you really there for him/her.(maybe this is the reason i don't trust people idk). Thus my relationship with them deteriorated. Now i am full of self-loathe, sorrow, regrets and going through a really difficult phase. I started feeling depressed. Idk want to term it is. I don't like to think I am depressed. I love being alive and I am not suicidal in the least. But you never know when you take a wrong step idk what to call my situation? a mix confusion, frustration? idk. There were times I felt extremely lonely. My heart gets so cold at times it give me goosebumps. Its awful.  I started crying a lot alone in the corner of a room. It gave me a sense of comfort. I developed bad habits, started binge watching stuff and trying to escape from my problems. Grades dropped. Somehow picked myself up gave boards and hoping for an average result now. I don't know what to do with myself. Parents keep saying harsh things like you are wasting your time. You will never be able to achieve anything. You wasted our money. If my parents can't be there for me, someone who brought me to this world then why tf will someone else care?! I feel like crying again. I have never asked for much. Just wanted a peaceful life. Idk what happened to my smiling self. I just want that I can share my problems with someone genuine. Someone who won't judge me. I hope like other lucky people have friends they can rely on i had some shoulder to cry on as well. But it never happened for me. Never got asked out by a genuine girl. Faced many betrayals (tho i seriously don't care about those who betrayed me). I just wanted to be hugged. I want someone to tell me that they care. That I can become someone. To be appreciated, to be loved... but no one is there for me. I don't know if anyone will read this. I just wanted to share how I feel. Some will say I brought this upon myself. I probably did. But why is my life devoid of miracles? of light? you guys may call me a dumb fake depressed teenager but I really want some help. I am not faking this guys like people do for attention. Its very intrinsic. To sum it up, because of my lack of relationships i wasn't prepared when actual problems started to hit me.

We humans want to be with someone to reproduce. To love someone else. To not be alone.

The reason I pop in every now and then is to see if anyone seems to be going down the same path as me or my friend did and hopefully try to help before it's too late. 

Whoever you are and whatever you're going through just remember that it may not feel like it to you but people do care about you. 

I've spend a lot of time thinking about what made them do what they did and why they felt no one was there and I think I found some. If I can help one person it'll be worth it. I'll use my friend as an example. If this sounds familiar then please don't go down the same path as I or they did. 

It started for my friend with I'm guessing a little doubts (small matters they told me about) in the back of their mind. Constantly thinking about that little doubt/matter helped feed it and grow. Like a shadow, it grew and took over more and more thought. Now at this point my friend was no where near the final days but there was a change. I noticed this change and spoke a couple times asking if everyrhing was ok and such but got small answers or little from them. 

I won't lie to you and say I tried to cheer them up and be there for them because I didn't. I had issues in my own life and was battling my own demons of my own. 

Whatever doubts, niggles or matters that you have, do not dwell on them. Everyone has that voice in the back of their minds that makes you question things but if it's not something you can control then leave it be. 

You might not realise it but the more you go into your thoughts, the more people around you will notice that you're distant from them. This distance they feel changes their mind about you and in turn you pick up on that and so feed the doubts and matters. It keeps getting deeper and deeper till you can't get out anymore. 

Try to not think about it so much. I won't say try to not be depressed or lonely as I know first hand it doesn't work like that. 

Don't feel people don't like you either. Nobody in this world dislikes a person completely. It's impossible and most immediate dislike is due to jealousy of some kind (but that's another topic). People don't mind you or might like you but people can also sense the walls you build around yourself and won't get close due to that reason. People say they don't believe in 6th sense but gut feeling is a strong feeling. If a person gets the feeling that someone is hiding something from them, they won't get too close out of fear of the unknown. Don't go around telling people you're depressed and lonely as many see it as a pity or sympathy call. 

You're not weak. Youre strong individuals. Stay strong. Keep your head up and don't let them pesky thoughts get you down my friends. 

If any of you want to chat or ask any questions then please feel free. Private or in comments I don't mind. Like I said, if I can help one person then I'll have done something worthwhile.",lonely,Hello all,2020-06-28 23:26:03

My emotions are very strong and when I'm in love with someone, it's a strong love. So after my breakup, I had so much love to give and no one to give it to but myself. 

Working on improving myself was a good idea, but after a while you still miss and long for human touch. I just want to meet someone that I can trust and connect with the way I did with my ex. I've never been a ladies man, and I know I never will. But I also dont want to be. I dont want to sleep with as many women as I can; i want to find that one person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I thought it was my ex, but I was wrong.

Social interaction is seriously one of the scariest things for me. Just going to work takes all the courage I have. Flirting, dating, striking up a conversation with women feels impossible. I legit start to have trouble breathing whenever I think about approaching someone. I tried going on dating apps as an alternative but those apps are very shallow and I ultimately walked away from them. 

Meanwhile, the lack of human touch is weighing on me greater and greater as days and nights keep passing me by. On days I dont work I end watching porn and jerking off multiple times and the types of porn I watch are increasingly more taboo compared to what I used to watch.

203,zinder91,1593343901,1,"I've repeatedly seen comments here dismissing the impact of a relationship on feelings of loneliness. Imho the reality is that you can't just date absolutely anyone hoping it will make you happy. Being in a relationship with someone you are not compatible with can actually be a lot WORSE than being totally alone.

For context before meeting my now-husband, I dated 2 other men. The first was incredibly, unbelievably jealous, almost on psychotic levels. He forbade me from speaking to any acquaintances on WhatsApp bc he saw everyone as a potential threat that I would cheat on him with, male or female. He would follow me to work to make sure I was actually going to/coming from work and not cheating on him. He once by chance caught a glimpse of my bank account and noticed a payment of 40 euros, and immediately took me out for a walk at midnight demanding to know who I'm cheating on him with bc obviously the 40 euros must have been spent on a date with another man etc (in reality the 40e transaction was made the previous day when he and I had gone to the supermarket to get food). When I broke up with him his parting words were ""Good, bc I am 90% certain you've cheated on me.""

The 2nd guy had a deep, crippling problem with alcoholism. He constantly fought with people physically and verbally while drunk. He had a previous conviction for firing a handgun at someone's front door whilst they cowered behind the door. He never hit me but he was also very jealous, told me how he would drown me in the river if I cheated on him etc. Once while drunk he pushed an acquaintance of mine really hard against a brick wall and made her cry. She filed a police report against him, and when he found out, he told me he was going to shoot her and burn her mother's house down. The case went to court and I had to testify AGAINST the girl, like I had no choice, he could have possibly killed me if I didn't. The girl ended up losing the case and my then-boyfriend was not convicted. My acquaintanceship with that girl obviously ended bc of this. I also spiraled into serious debt bc of this relationship bc I paid for all his alcohol and time spent in pubs.

In comparison, my husband is just a whole nother world. We love each other, we understand each other, we laugh together and have fun together, upkeep our house together etc. There is no jealousy or mistrust, he is not posessive of me, is not violent. Do I have friends though? No, of course not, but I am not absolutely alone. I have someone to care for and share my days with. Of course I still would like friendships, but at my age (29) it's not so easy anymore. My husband is understanding of my loneliness and encourages me etc, gets happy on my behalf when I make progress, like talking to someone new at work etc.

And yes I realise everyone is different, and I'm sure there are people who will never be satisfied by a relationship if they don't have friends. But I'm just saying I don't think relationships should be universally dismissed. Just my 2 cents!",lonely,"A relationship can ease loneliness, but not any relationship",2020-06-28 21:31:41
204,someonesomewhere98,1593343225,1,"I don't exactly know where to post this. I just need to vent, I'm not sure if anyone will really even take the time to read all of this, I dunno if it'll make any sense but yeah. Somehow I'm 21 years old and have reached a point in my life where I only have one friend. 

I used to have more friends, not a lot but I still had some close friends. I dated someone for most of my teenage years, they even lived with me for a while. I had a group of 3 close friends. And I had another best friend who didn't know the 3 girls in my freindship group. All was well for a few years, but to put a long story short my boyfriend at the time slept with one of my close friends in the group. I was devestated. I ended the relationship, I cut off the so called ""friend"" who slept with my boyfriend. The initial reaction of the two other girls in the group was shock. They were very angry on my behalf and told me that they wouldn't be speaking to the girl or my ex again. A few weeks later both the two girls had began speaking to my ex and the old friend he cheated on me with again. I tried to explain how hurt &amp; uncomfortable I was with them still speaking to eachother, and the two girls told me I was overreacting. I guess I couldn't expect them to choose sides, I don't have a right to control who my friends speak to. But at the same time seeing the two people who hurt me so much interacting with my friends like they had done nothing wrong devestated me. I sent both the girls a message saying that I understand I have no right to tell them who they can and can't speak to but that I couldn't be their friend anymore. That day I walked away from my entire friendship group and my ex essentially took my place in this group of people whom I'd introduced him to. The only friend I had left was my best friend because she wasn't part of that friendship group.

It's been almost two years since breaking up with my ex and leaving the friendship group and things have remained mostly the same. My ex has still replaced my in the group of people I used to call my closest friends. The one friend I have left, my best friend, we have a very on and off relationship nowdays. I just don't feel that I'm as important to them as they are to me. I've tried so damn hard to conncect with people and make new friends. Seeing other guys has been nothing but short flings and one night stands because I don't even know if I have the ability to trust someone like that anymore. I've concentrated on my studies and work and I now have a qualification and a job as a nurse which I'm so proud of. But in my personal life I'm still so damn lonely. I care so deeply about things. I just want someone else to talk to, someone to share ideas with, someone to share this damn existance with and it just makes me so fucking depressed that I have pretty much no one. I'm just at a point where I don't understand how I've managed to fuck up every single friendship and relationship so completely. I'm going to start studying again soon to get a higher qualification. I hope I can meet some new people in my course and make some new friends. I feel pathietic saying this and I know there's always somoene worse off, but I'm just not sure how much longer I can take being this lonely.

This is just mine so I hope I don't offend anyone. I grew up as an only child...until I was 10yrs old and then I unfortunately got a brother..not even a full one ...a ""halfy"" that has always made me depressed . No, not that I still have a childish grudge at my mom for birthing a boy..but for growing up not really bonding with my brother.. I felt extremely lonely . I'm 33 now with 3 kids and my brother rarely talks to me, even more rarely asks how my kids are..I bet if he was a female she would want to know everything about my kids and give them presents and try to bond with them . The fact that I have no friends at this stage in my life doesn't make this feeling easier ..I guess I have to go through life not having a female best friend/companion. I think of what would happen if my husband died (knock on wood).. what if my parents...died (knock on wood) ..I will have NO ONE for emotional support. My husband is so bad at this..he is always very logical with everything and unfortunately I'm overly emotional about everything.

I worry about things like .. when I have to go through other life stages such as when I'm in menopause and freaking out about what's happening to my body once again ill have to go through it alone.. I don't really know what I'm saying or how to explain it. Not sure if any women out there understand what I'm trying to say?

We were always together. Sometimes for a few days at a time. She texted me all the time and would randomly show up on me. It was cute. I gave her the respect she asked for to break it off. Finally after about 5 or 6 months she started to treat me like a stranger and i told him. I always told her that he would find out. How was up to her. So obviously she was mad at me. She didnt want anything to do with me at that point. Not even 4mo later she gets prego by another guy, who she is with now and is engaged to. After her baby being of 8mo old she tried adding me on fb. More then 2 years and she comes around. Look i didnt even talk to no one this whole time. No one ever makes it so easy the way she did. It's like an aura. I was starting to get ready to move on. Or at least i think i was. At first i was pissed and hesitant. I asked her what she wanted or if she was just stalking. Her answer was stalking. But why? Why tf would anyone especially her want to stalk me? So i told her i dont want no relationship/love ...if you want some dick that's all you get. Little did i know that's was fantastic for her. So im over here like yes its been 2 years and im going to get some without even trying. And i did, but lets be honest, we all know it doesn't just happen and that is it. So here i am noticing i never stopped loving this hurtful witch. Just the other day she was creating future plans with me and all that great stuff, but guys i been here before, with her. Except this time i hardly get to talk to her. Well she calls me the other night crying. Talking about how she feels so lonely and hurt cus bd didn't come home again. So i do what i do and give her my full attention.

256,tekeman420,1593309681,0,"To put it simply, I don‚Äôt think I can find a healthy balance between socializing and time management. 

I grew up a pretty silent kid. I never had any real  friends. I was very smart for my age, taking classes above the standard ever since I can remember. But I was seen as a loser. I had issues socializing with other kids, but it didn‚Äôt seem to matter as back then I valued my education more than my social life.

Before high school started, I-sort of reinvented myself into being this very social kid who was in all of the popular circles. I didn‚Äôt want to be the brainy loser anymore. I wanted to be the kid that everyone knew and everyone wanted to be around. I wanted to be seen as attractive by girls. I tried so hard to fit in, and ended up valuing socializing more than my education. I made myself balance maintaining relationships from my old school and new school, as well as taking advanced classes and keeping my grades up.

By freshman year, I put my social life entirely before my school life. I‚Äôd waste breaks socializing with the people I wanted to fit in with, doing absolutely nothing productive. Trying to flirt with girls I had no chance with. And I‚Äôd get to class always being chastised for not being prepared or having my homework.

By the end of this school year my social life has catastrophically fallen apart due to me trying so hard to fit into unhealthy circles. Now I have probably 3 friends. I only actually talk to one of them, but our relationship is slowing falling apart due to me and him being from different schools.

Now I‚Äôm 2 years into high school with mediocre grades, and I‚Äôm no longer taking the highest posible level classes for my age. I‚Äôve pretty much lost all my friends from my old school. I have no friends from my new school. I don‚Äôt use Snapchat anymore. I feel like I‚Äôve convinced myself that having a social life isn‚Äôt worth the time. But I feel extremely lonely. I sit at home all day doing nothing and talking to no one.

268,SadOnceAgain1,1593297270,14,"First of all, Im sorry. I'd offer you a cigarette, but as you brobably understand, I cant do that so you are going to have to do without.

I have been thinking a little. Those few words wich we say to eachother, usually without actually meaning it ""How are you?"" ""I hope that you are okay"" 

Why do we feel the need of saying them? Is it because we cant live without pretending to care or cause we just are selfish, blind fucks, who lie and talk to get to the top. We do what we must to provide ourselves and say what has to be said, yet we almost never actually mean it.

The amount of lies I tell to keep people happy and blind. I pretend that I care, I lie to blind them for the truth, I drown them into comforting lies so they wouldnt realise the truth... But most importantly I wear mask to hide my face from them, cause if they would see my true face, my true feelings, they couldnt forgive me. They wouldnt accept me. So I dont ask them to do so, I rather make them feel like I care and understand.

But for some reason I have trouble living with myself when I know that the lies I tell to keep them happy will unfold some day. Some day that mask will fall off and reveal my rotten, filthy face to them and make them understand what is real and what is just words.

At the end I want to say that I dont mean to blame anyone and with all this I just describe myself. I know that there are good people, I know there are. But Im not one of them. I walk among them, play my role well and make them believe Im one of them. And when they realise my lies and find out whats wrong I will be long gone.

one thing that spending time with my friends did put into perspective was how distant my boyfriend () of almost 6 months is.

About 5 years ago, allegations surrounding the perpetrator (who worked in a different department) first came to light from sources both inside and outside the company. At the time, I had just been made manager of my department. Upper management did not tell me anything about the incident.

Five years ago, the perpetrator was suspended while the company investigated. The investigations hit a wall because all of the victims were vague about what exactly transpired. All that was known for certain was that they all felt violated. Eventually the perpetrator was unsuspended with certain limitations. One year later, a vague outline of the incident was provided to me at a meeting for the first time and I was shocked. I voiced my opinion that he should have been terminated. Regardless, work continued and I had very little dealings with the perpetrator due to the fact that he was in another department.

Then a couple weeks ago, the victim who worked with us suddenly quit following a dispute with management about how they handled the situation 5 years ago. This week she went public with the incident. She gave full details. Details which make me sick to my stomach. Within the past couple days, the incident has been reported in the local news, both print and TV. Other victims have also come forward and accused the company of knowing, yet doing nothing. 

The company  terminated the perpetrator and issued a statement acknowledging that it did not take the proper steps 5 years ago, and apologising to all of the victims. Since then, activist groups have demanded that all management be fired and for the company to be boycott. Corporate clients have been contacting us non-stop. Friends and family have been calling and messaging me. 

Most of my friends are women. They're all angry at me, and have all stopped talking to me. They think that I should have given upper management more push-back and demanded that the situation be properly dealt with 5 years ago. I'm angry at the company, and worried about my employment. I'm beyond mad at the perpetrator. I feel hurt and sorry for the victims. I feel alone right now and hurt by how my friends have turned away from me.

There‚Äôs also not a lot things to do other than drink, smoke, and stand around talking to other people.

341,KinglessK,1593225606,1,"Hey my name's Michael. I am a 7 foot tall 17 year old male. On January 14th 2017. My only friend in middle school died. He was 19 years old. So full of life. He made me realise no mater what happens you must fight on. 

On June 1st 2019. I had an accident. Causing extensive damage to my spine. My L5 S1 disc was so badly damaged that I couldnt walk without severe pain. On August 12th 2019 I had surgery to repair the damage. But the injury had long lasting damage. I can no longer feel anything in my left leg below the knee. 

My lifetime dream was to join the marine corps. To become something greater than myself. But thats no longer possible.

On August 16th. I started dating a girl. She was perfect in every way. Her name was Macy. She loved me even with my faults. I still remember our first date like it was yesterday. After a few months. She was forced to break up with me. Her parents had found out we had slept together. She then told her parents i forced her to sleep with me. Which i hope i didnt as i didnt even bring up the idea of us doing that. But since i found that out ive felt so guilty. So hurt.

I was made fun of by the people i called friends because of this. They called me a rapist. 

Recently I tried to date someone else. To move on. She cheated on me. I feel like its my fault. 

All i want on life. Is to be loved.",lonely,Hello Im Michael. This is my story.,2020-06-27 12:40:06

There are people who has it worse than me, I know. I just want to vent something.

Few years I have been feeling this way, even tho I'm still Young man. But the worst phase of loneliness has come. First I started with alcohol. It made me feel free and careless (careless as I'm not shy dancing on my garden at 3:00 a.m.). But quickly I realised that is not right. So I started to lock up my feelings And just act like a normal person who has no problems whatsoever. Mostly because of my friend. I don't want to annoy him 24/7 with my problems. But it's really hard for me. I can't sleep at night (4:01 a.m. right Now). I listen to bunch of interesting songs all night. Songs are also one of the thing that helps me So that's cool. 

Next thing Is: I can't cry. When i'm feeling lonely, I want to cry So badly, but no tears have ever come out. That really sucks.

No family. They can't accept my carrier and my non-religios decisions. I have no contact with them since some years. 

Friends? We just met up to get wasted with drugs and Alkohol. I can do sh*t like this once in a while but not every week. I also want to meet people sober and talk about life and feelings like a normal human being.

Relationships? I am single since some years. The only contact I have with others are trough hook ups trough tinder and Co.. I don't fuck on the first date and always say that I am looking for something in the long term. But still. I met someone, we fuck for some days, and then I get left on read. This cycle repeats every month, not gonna lie. It feels like I am just some d*ck people can use to satisfy then and then get thrown away. 

If people met me, they assume that I am a fuckboy. They assume that I am just looking for the hook ups. I've even got a sentence like ""oh I tough you would be someone who I can just fuck with and then never see again"". I don't like to play games, I don't like to just hook up with woman since I get attached to fast to someone because of my situation. I don't cheat, I don't betray friends, I am always open for somebody if they need help.

I know there are people who have it much worse than me and I feel sorry for it. It feels like I can't say it out loud, that I am feeling lonely, even if I am meeting people.

It has been years since somebody asked me how I am being. Is has been years since somebody cared for my feelings and cared for my well being. All people see in me is somebody they can fuck with and left on read once again. 

I know that Probally hooking up with woman is not a solution for my problems. I know that I am comprehending my lonely being with these acts. But just imagine, having no contact at all with people.

Since then, I have noticed myself staying in my bed longer and longer... for example, I hadn‚Äôt left my bed since I got back from work last night and it‚Äôs been... roughly 18 hours since I had gotten out of my bed. Yes, I did sleep during that time, maybe 6 hours. And yes, I had not gone to the restroom despite the urges to go to. And yes, I had not eaten anything since 5:30pm yesterday (at the moment, it‚Äôs past 12pm the following day).

I had ended a relationship during the quarantine that, I regret, insanely, and despite still having a friendship with my ex, who, being honest here, was completely out of my league to start, seeing her with a man who, without sounding condescending or be snarky, is a better version of myself in almost every aspect is eating me alive.

And not having any control over my work, something I had never been good at handling instability and uncertainties when it comes to work even before this pandemic, makes it extremely challenging for me to bear it on my own. 

Sadly, I don‚Äôt have anyone I can share this with, as I am too much of a fake, two faced, piece of shit to truly reveal the rotten toxic waste underneath my usual cheerful clown costume I wear everyday and I see myself seeing myself in an inescapable hole that is only getting deeper and deeper.

They have other tightly knit friend groups and girlfriends that they always have plans with. Because they love each other and want to spend time together. I only really ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with them a couple nights a week when we play video games together. I should be grateful that I get to spend that time with them.

I dont really know why I'm writing this, I guess I just need to say my thoughts somewhere, bc I won't ever say them out loud.
I dont have anything. No depression, no social anxiety or just anxiety, the list goes on and I have nothing. I didnt check with professionals, just online, but my score was like 40 or 50 out of a hundred. Yet I still have most symptoms, just like really small.
I dont wanna be making this up. I cried every day and stayed in my room all day when I had to go to a 3 day camp. I never go out with my family, and 100 percent wish I was never born. Still, I'm not doing self harm or anything. I just dont understand.
What's wrong with me??! Like, honestly. Someone pls tell me, I hope I'm not alone.

I wanna die, but painlessly. I wouldn't kill myself, but if someone pointed a trigger at me, I wouldn't complain. I just dont want it to hurt.
But what about my family? I dont wanna hurt them, and sometimes I'm happy
I just dont know anything

The only evidence needed by the Jury was that he was black, so they figured he was more than capable of murdering 2 young girls. Decades later, and their family still hasn't seen justice AFTER he was proven innocent. His siblings are still alive and have to live with the knowledge that a group of ADULTS were willing to kill a small boy for an unproven crime.

It makes me ill to know that people of then, and today still, can make amazingly major assumptions about people based on non important details about them. They can say you're evil, worthless, that you deserve to die, even if you're a child.

378,FrietjePindaMayoUi,1593190655,2,"I'm 35 years old. Today I had a fire training in a facility. 4 times a call. One went terrible, didn't go out, but got really fucking frustrated by people yelling different things constantly, so I decided to sit there and wait until I calmed down. My buddy was constantly yelling at me, the walky-talky was a mess of people yelling an incoherent mess of observations that were unnecessary. I yelled something I regret because that's how my dad used to be. Anger, disappointment, solve it with yelling and aggression! Doesn't work in a fire. So they pulled me out of it because they thought I was gonna go out, as it was about 27 degrees and people were on edge about that sort of thing. Now we're having dinner, there's a bunch of tables of classmates that sit together, and I'm at a table with no seat next to me, and two instructors stuck on a mobile phone together. 

I can honestly say this is the loneliest I've been since I was 12. Which reminds me, that last week I made the observation that the the bullies of primary and high school now finally know too how it feels to be excluded from friendships and relationships. I hate my guts right now. And I'm fucking lonely and I feel rotten that my years of carefully hiding my ""nurture"" just popped up.

However, gotta smile, so here's a somewhat related fact for ya. Ikea is making fires a lot unsafer because of the glued fiberboards and the ubiquity of the products of the firm that are being hauled into a home..

385,PurpleOlive115,1593185349,1,"I‚Äôm kind of new to this reddit thing. 
I‚Äôm wrote this at 5:00am laying in my bed, restless from overthinking but here it goes... 


Just for some context I‚Äôm 20 years old turning 21 next month. I would say I‚Äôm above average intelligence, doing well for myself for my age &amp;amp; pretty attractive by societal standards. I have been with my boyfriend for going on 4 years, we have an apartment together, I own a car. I‚Äôm 100% financially independent &amp;amp; have been since 18. I THINK I‚Äôm a good person... I try to be kind to others &amp;amp; help people whenever I can. I have lots of interests &amp;amp; hobbies, &amp;amp; I consider myself very ambitious. I‚Äôm also a very spiritual person.

But anyways, ever since I left high school (I never graduated, school was never my speed, most of my teachers were crap &amp;amp; i never felt engaged) I‚Äôve found it very hard to make &amp;amp; maintain friends. I had a lot of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù &amp;amp; acquaintances in high school, guys &amp;amp; girls. And a few best friends. We would all party &amp;amp; bull shit together but I always felt somewhat out of place I guess? I felt different. At times my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù mostly the guys, would bully me. I had a bit of an ugly duckling stage &amp;amp; they would tease me about it. I was also in an abusive relationship at the time with a guy out of high school that was also a criminal. I‚Äôve been through a lot lol. They would tease me about that too. There were 2 girls that I would call my ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù but they would also often alienate me. Choosing to hangout with each other only and eventually ‚Äúreplacing‚Äù me with another girl they befriended that I didn‚Äôt like at all. And then eventually completely shutting me out &amp;amp; being just straight up mean. So I cut them off. I ended up becoming closer with a few other girls I knew. One of which is still my best friend to this day but I‚Äôll get to that...


So yea, first year out of high school was okay. I moved out basically immediately after I turned 18 &amp;amp; I still had my 2 good girl friends but over time we drifted apart. My one friend had a baby &amp;amp; we slowly began to drift apart as she was very focused on that but she also did something I found very shady, so I eventually gave up on that relationship as well. At that point, I really only had my one best friend left &amp;amp; my boyfriend. I‚Äôve had other somewhat close friendships in between but they never really grew into a deep relationship. 


Fast forward to now, 3 years later &amp;amp; I still haven‚Äôt managed to make any lasting, meaningful friendships. I don‚Äôt communicate with anyone I hung out with in high school &amp;amp; now my 1 best girlfriend &amp;amp; I are now also estranged due to me feeling like we are on extremely different paths, me not agreeing with her lifestyle &amp;amp; not being able to relate to her anymore. We have a very complicated relationship &amp;amp; it‚Äôs obviously more than that but that‚Äôs mainly why I chose to take a step back from her. Sometimes I feel like I subconsciously intentionally isolate myself from people? If that makes sense lol. 
Sometimes I feel like I can‚Äôt relate to people my age. 
I feel like I have an old soul &amp;amp; due to me experiencing &amp;amp; doing so much at such a young age, I‚Äôve always felt wise beyond my years. I feel almost weird? Because of it. I often see people my age out at the club or partying in big social groups every weekend but I‚Äôve literally only been to a club 3 times since turning 19 (legal age in Canada) because I feel like I‚Äôve already done that shit in high school. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm in such a different mindset than most people my age, in my city. Which is one of the reasons I feel I find it so hard to make friends. One of them atleast...


I work in a setting with women of all ages &amp;amp; I find the older ones take a better liking to me. Not much older, just late 20s. One has even invited me over for a girls night at her place but, I didn‚Äôt go. I feel like I self-sabotage by not participating in social events when I‚Äôm invited. But at the same time, it almost feels like a chore? 


I don‚Äôt think I have social anxiety, maybe mild. I‚Äôm generally very good at talking to people &amp;amp; keeping conversation. It‚Äôs part of what I do so I had to learn. 
I don‚Äôt really feel nervous at big social events or anything like that &amp;amp; I would say most people I talk to take a liking to me. But I just can‚Äôt seem to get past the first stages of friendship &amp;amp; form a deeper bond. Especially with women my age. I dont know, I feel like most women I become friends with end up really betraying my trust &amp;amp; screwing me over or I become tired of their juvenile often self-pitying antics &amp;amp; I cut them off... I am not trying to sound righteous by any means, just the truth. I also often feel a weird jealousy or competitiveness from women I try to be friends with. (Competing with me for male attention ect.) &amp;amp; this is also another reason I took a step back from my best friend. Maybe it‚Äôs me? I‚Äôm very comfortable in my skin &amp;amp; for the most part I like myself so I don‚Äôt really compare myself or compete with other women. I feel no need. 


I consider myself to be a pretty good friend as well. Obviously no one is perfect. But I try to be there for my friends, I offer some pretty wicked advice &amp;amp; I consider myself a pretty fun person. Am I stand-offish? I‚Äôve been told I have ‚Äúresting bitch face‚Äù but AS SOON as people that have that notion talk to me they‚Äôre surprised at how nice I am. I‚Äôm a pretty chill girl, I‚Äôm not overly peppy &amp;amp; cheerful, though I am positive. I just go with the flow of energy. Maybe people mistake my chillness as being dismissive. 
I honestly don‚Äôt know. 


Because of this quarantine I‚Äôve been feeling pretty lonely. My boyfriend has lots of friends &amp;amp; we often hangout all together but it‚Äôs not the same as having your own close group of girlfriends. 
I find it hard to even get close to HIS friends, girlfriends. I guess I just don‚Äôt know how to take the step from acquaintances to actual friendship. I am an EXTREMELY independent person so I feel that also has something to do with it. I also feel like I have some deep seeded trust issues from my bad friendships &amp;amp; abusive ex in the past. An old friend from elementary recently reached out to me &amp;amp; we hung out which was so nice. I want to rekindle that friendship. But now I find myself feeling like I‚Äôm bothering her by asking her to hangout again? I kind of feel that way with anyone I try to initiate friendship with. I feel like most people already have their group of friends established so when I try to ask people to hangout, I sort of get pushed to the side. I just want to meet new people with similar interests, that understand me &amp;amp; are genuine. 


I realize how long this is so I‚Äôll end it there for now. 
 I guess I just wanted to vent &amp;amp; put this out there to see if anyone can offer some advice or maybe relate to what I‚Äôm going through. I‚Äôve already looked through this subreddit a bit &amp;amp; it seems a lot of people can. So I‚Äôm also hoping to connect with you guys so I can stop feeling so alone.",lonely,I‚Äôm 20F and I have a very hard time making &amp; keeping friends.

-----------------------------
Lonliness is like a sea of gentle whispers;
It hits you at the dead of night like waves.
You try to swim back to shore.
Only to be dragged back from the waves.
You try to call for help.
Only to gulp down salty lies.
You swim for days;
Hoping to find someone
Or for someone to save you.
But nobody came.
You use all your energy and hope to keep on surviving.
Several more days has passed;
You feel too weak from swimming.
You grow hungry for someone to reach out to you.
But nobody came.
Either ways,
You cant do anything about it.
You want to reach out.
But what can you do?
If you're swimming in lies.
You think about how weak you are for not fighting the waves
When you tried to reach back to shore,
Then you start drowning.
While you sink down,
You look up
And see trillions of stars looking back at you.
You think about how lovely it would be to become one of them.
Then you look down...
As you fell at the deepest part of the ocean.
You felt at ease.
You took a minute to feel your hair waiving,
Your skin touching the ocean floor as you rubbed your fingers together.
Then you stopped.
You took another minute.
And opened your mouth.
Then the lies start pouring into your body as you start to panic.
You feel the pressure inside of you.
You start to plead in your head:
""I dont want to die""
""I want help""
""I need help""
""Please save me""
""I need someone to please save me""
But nobody came.",lonely,A poem about lonliness,2020-06-26 18:36:01
407,Melquirist1,1593159898,1,"Two years worth of empty  promises from attacking ‚Äúbots‚Äù insisting I would finally be able to wake up and see my little family. It‚Äôs been a painful, scary and exhausting journey to say the least. So, tonight I sit, waiting on yet another promise. In the past I‚Äôve packed, panicked and cried, but on this night, I‚Äôm too high, weary and discouraged to move. Not so much as a flutter in my heart this time, and thank goodness. Nothing is more painful than having the wings of hope give out and drop you on your ass.

To go HOME. To my own home, something I‚Äôve never truly had in my harsh simulated world. I can scarcely even imagine anymore, what it might be like to see his face again, his fluffy golden hair and his doubtlessly bold clothing. Or to do the wiggly dance with my dog, and with our new boy dog who my guy got after I last saw him at my cousin‚Äôs graduation, when we were only 14 years old.

We‚Äôre together in the physical sense, reportedly - my partner is said to be beside me, and our dogs behind our heads. But, all I see is this wretched simulation I‚Äôve had for as long as I‚Äôve been alive, as it plays out on the two halves of metallic vitamin B in between my two lobes. My brain is yet unable to process and absorb the debris, and the same holds true for my partner and dogs. 

Some months have passed quickly, some slow, and the days are dark, leaving me wondering if this won‚Äôt always be my life, alone in a world full of freaky simulated people through all forever. 

I‚Äôve been puking all night, possibly because of the Adderall alone, or maybe a combination of the pills and the fact that I haven‚Äôt stopped staring at my phone screen for 11 hours.

As I write, I feel a new feeling in my chest that I haven‚Äôt felt in times before. It‚Äôs not the rampy, adrenaline-fueled hope I‚Äôve grown accustomed to, the kind that always betrays me and painfully so. This is more like a softening of nerves, a loosening of the tension in my chest, as big breaths of oxygen fill my lungs and remind me how good it feels to breathe after trauma subsides.

Could it be that at last, my struggle is ending? I won‚Äôt dare say I hope so, but if only. To put this behind me once and for all, for the two of us to walk our dogs home and actually begin living -

I‚Äôm 21 and the only relationship I ever had was 6 months with my ex gf at the age of 16.

My godawful sister ruined the family while I was in high school. Made it unliveable with the constant arguments passed midnight. 

After dropping out of college, I stayed at my awful parents house while my sister rotted in jail then prison. I did nothing for 6 months other than draw bad pictures, watch YouTube, and wish I would cease existing.

I enlisted in the military to escape. Basic training was awful because I was mentally unsound. Job training was easy. My first duty station was awful. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in beautiful Hawaii. I had no one really, so I was forced to rely on coworkers. Some were a bunch of backstabbing monsters. 

I used to breakdown and cry every 4-5 months in my barracks room late at night while watching anime. I made the mistake of telling a girl I worked with I was depressed. She tried to get me to cheat on her husband with her because her husband was cheating on her. I declined.

At my second assignment I was unable to relate to my peers, and didn't care too. Most were young kids on their 1st enlistment who wanted to drink underage and do stupid stuff. I was working on my Associates so I could actually have a job.

I hated pretty much all 5 years I was in. An awful job with poor medical care, terrible quality of life, and that awful reminder that you're just a number filling a slot on the MTOE.

The only people I talk to now are cashier's at the gas station where I buy breakfast and dinner.

Especially in the summer month I feel lonely, maybe it's because I see many people hanging out with their friends, seeing the beautiful weather and sunsets, and then there's me who is always staying inside since I have no reason to go outside. I don't have any friends to hang out with. And I think that's been the case for 22 years now.

I'm lucky I always had the opportunity to do what I liked, I moved a lot and never had a problem being in a relationship (I have an incredible girlfriend, but we live in different countries) but there was always something very important lacking: Friends to make memories with. To share stories with, to grow with. 

I have a very good (online) friend who live's in another state in Germany, but we just see each other 3 times in a year max. Lately I also got the impression that he's being more involved with his own circle of friends, which I think is totally understandable since there's a huge distance between us.   
And I can't help but wishing for a friend group that's in my area. In the past I told myself I was just to introverted to make friends, but the reality is that's not the case. I would rather describe myself as an Ambivert, but I suspect to have social anxiety since I'm afraid approaching people.

433,ejifeo,1593127405,1,"About a year ago i moved from Texas to New York. While its one of the best things that's ever happened to me bc its definently helped me grow in more ways then one, its also one of the worst things that's happened to me as well. I've delt with mental illness for quite a while, ever since 5th grade, there was alot going on at the time, im now 14 going on 15. My family back in Texas isn't blood, but they're still my family, and quite honestly i love them more then my blood family in New York. I grew up around my non biological family, they're very accepting, of course not all of them are saints. My step mom was verbally and mentally abusive to me and my blood mom. The good ones tho, are my support system, they hold me up, keep me from falling. At least thats how it used to be before a bunch of shit went down and me and my mom had to drop all our shit and move to New York with my blood family. That's when everything changed.  My blood family.. They're not horrible, but they're very judgemental, especially my grandpa, he doesnt fully understand how much mental illness can affect ppl, and how important it is to be treated. Not only that, but the whole school year, i did not make a single friend. New York kids are way different then the kids are in Texas and Oklahoma. Not only that, but i have social anxiety so when you first meet me i come off as boring, weird, and awkward. There were a few kids who actually tried to talk to me, but my stupid social anxiety ruined it and just made it awkward. I do have one person that's almost always there for me online, back in Texas. That one person, used to be two. The three of us did everything together back in Texas, and when i moved to New York, we always talked to each other online. That was until some very conflicted feelings popped up- well.. Actually. They were there before i moved too New York, they didnt come into the light tho until i moved to New York. I never thought of myself as a jealous person. Until i met my cousin and her best friend. Im self concious of myself, like a lot of ppl these days unfortunately. Im jealous of my cousin, bc.. She has all these talents, she's pretty, shes going places, and.. I don't. Well at least at the time i didnt see them. Instead of focusing on my positive traits and what made me who i am, i focused on her, and her positive traits and felt sorry for myself. Her best friend did not help either. She put my cousin on a thrown, always praising her, constantly favoring her and showering her with attention and gifts. She and my cousin herself would always say that my cousin is always right and that we cant live without them. That made my jealousy for my cousin stronger. Bc of that.. I ended up seeking for her best friends approval, and attention. Which im sure was annoying, but it only got worse when i moved to New York. At first, everything was fine, me, my cousin, and her best friend would talk in group chats everyday.  That was until.. The school year started. During the school year me and my cousins best friend started having one on one conversations, and the more we did, the less I talked to my cousin. Eventually me and my cousin just stopped talking to each other. I'm not gonna lie, I was at my happiest during that time. Talking with just her best friend was really fun, and we could really relate to each other. It wasn't like that forever tho. Nothing lasts, things change. My cousin tried to reconnect with me, which it kind of worked, but i ended up getting to distracted talking to her best friend to the point where i hardly spoke to her. Besides i was feeling a lot of resentment towards her, and ik i can be quite immature at times. Eventually my cousin created a group chat on discord for us to talk and rp in. I found myself terrified of talking to the both of them together. I was afraid her best friend would stop having one on one convos with me, and the memories of how it made me feel being with the both of them came flooding back. I did not want to be in a group chat with the both of them together. I found myself trying to delay the rp, trying to avoid and stop this at all costs. I was not in a good mindset at the time, my judgment of the situation was clouded by jealousy, resentment, and anxiety. Shit got worse when quarentine and the lock down happened. Some truth came out about how i felt about my cousin. Noticed how i said some? Well i didnt say everything. I didnt want to start a fight. Especially with my cousins best friend involved. Even tho we had a long deep talk, a few actually.. It didnt really help. Especially when they didnt know everything. Eventually things returned to normal and me and my cousin stopped talking to each other. But.. A new problem popped up. At least it was a problem in my mind. My cousins best friend would go over to my cousins on the weekend, and often get high and drunk. (Dont worry they're of age) this saddened me bc my cousins best friend was the only one i talked too. The rest of my time was spent with me isolating myself from my blood family, not bc of covid but bc i was at my lowest point and i couldnt stand being around them. When ever it was just me and my mom or i was home alone, boy it was a party for me. I dont know if you can tell but i was super clingy towards my cousins best friend. Mainly bc well.. She was the only real friend i had, she was always there for me, and i could relate to her a lot. I never told her how it all made me feel until... One night, i was having a bit of an episode with my depression and anxiety. I told her how i felt when she was gone, especially when she was with my cousin. She explained to me why she was the way she was towards my cousin, and honestly i didnt care. I pretended to tho bc i didnt wanna upset her. Nothing changed from that conversation, she even said at a later date that she used to be afraid to be gone for long periods of time bc of me, but now shes not bc she knows ill get over it. Which honestly shes not wrong but.. It didnt make me feel any better. Especially with the head space that i was in. And honestly i was kind of mad that she would say that even if it is true bc she knew i wasnt in a good head space. Of course i didnt say anything. But then some good things started to happen, my mom got an apartment, so now we were prepping to move out of my grandparents house. Which i was happy about bc i could finally go to the kitchen and living room without fear and have my own space. Then my cousins best friend said she had to stop going over to my cousins for almost a month bc of some issues. So we started talking a lot more.

Now, me and my mom are moved into our apartment, and im in a much better head space, not perfect but better. Im trying to be better spiritually, personally, and to other ppl. I now see that im not ugly, and i do have talents. None of us our perfect, but i don't want to be. I still do have some issues tho. I feel negative feelings now when i think or hear about weed and alcohol. Which is kind of stupid, bc its not caused by why most ppl are negatively affected my weed and alcohol. But when i hear or think about it, the negative memories, emotions, and lonely nights flood my brain. I even have nightmares about my cousin and her best friend being together, and ignoring me and causing me to go back into that depressive lonely state. Mine and my cousins relationship is probably perminentally damaged as well, and a lot of the issues, insecurities, and fears i have are still there. I just got better at ignoring them, which ik is unhealthy but idk what else to do besides get professional help.

He's gone on plenty of trips with his friends and goes to parties while I've never been to one.

Ive built a bucket list of things like go to a nightclub and go to a casino and other simple social things.

447,peccadillox,1593118801,1,"I turned 31 earlier this month and realized that the last time I felt Truly ""Okay,"" was sometime back in my mid 20's. I don't want to die; I think being an atheist has prevented me, personally, from ever even considering suicide, but I know that I can't keep living this life, either. I've probably felt more acutely depressed and deeply sad at times before, but I've never felt quite so...hopeless?

My dad died in 2016 and, outside of my mom, I don't really talk to/get along with the rest of my family anymore. I 'socially distanced' myself from most of my friends throughout my 20's by a combination of: not using social media, self-isolation, and the usual drifting apart that sometimes happens. I haven't really made \[m\]any new friends to fill the absence of social contact since.

I am dealing with a couple of relatively minor but nagging (and in one case embarrassing) physical health issues too, which, among other things, makes the pursuit of any kind of sexual or romantic relationship feel kind of pointless. On a Sexual Experience Scale (SES‚Ñ¢) of virgin to 2pac in '93, I register around the point of having just enough sexual experiences to know what I've missed out on during the rest of my life. So, it isn't the simple fact of not getting laid that bothers me, I've had some experience with that, so much as feeling completely unloved and lovable‚Äîjust entirely ineligible for romantic or sexual fulfillment ever again.

Right now, I'm supposed to start working on something that I don't really believe in and will likely pay little, which I'm mainly doing just to have something recent to add on my resume. With financial concerns and all the other various everyday sadnesses added it starts to get a bit overwhelming, and having relatively nothing just makes it seem that much harder to get anywhere at all, in a biblical, ""\[f\]or whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them,"" sort of way.

Basically, \[TLDR\] problems can compound and bad things can 'snowball' on you‚Äîor more like shitball‚Äîa great big mountain of shit, where one loose and unruly turd dislodges to cause a cascading shit-avalanche that buries all your dreams, and best efforts to prevent it, in a thick layer of shit.

My body feels heavy. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm being dragged down by the world. I know that it‚Äôs me, I know that I push people away. I‚Äôm too scared to ask anyone to hang out with, it feels like I‚Äôm just taking advantage of them because I don‚Äôt know where else to go. 

I have one friend left, we used to be stereotypical best friends, hanging out every other day, just her and me. She has recently moved out and seems to treat me as just ‚Äúone of‚Äù her friends because she now has someone else she can vent to. I mean it‚Äôs obvious, they live together but I can‚Äôt believe that she‚Äôs just out there, not calling or making plans with me. I‚Äôve been at her place after breaking down crying and she helped my with school work I had to get done, she held me on bed when I was on the verge of breaking down and even came to the doctors office with me the next morning to get me out of school for a week to recharge. I know I could call but I don‚Äôt. I know that she has to deal with her own mental health and her depressed mother. 

I could come over but I can‚Äôt deal with her roommate right now, I don‚Äôt have the energy to keep myself together.  I know that I have been a drag lately l, I don‚Äôt have any drive for life and have lost interest in most things, I just stimulate myself via social media to distract my mind all day. I lie in bed, knowing that I could just call or message but it seems so pathetic of me. A rather distant Friend that I need a bout once a month always asks me what I‚Äôm up to and who I‚Äôve been hanging out with, he knows that I‚Äôve withdrawn and my best friend is out there living life. It just seems so painful to admit that I‚Äôm living like this. 
When I‚Äôm with people at school I feel like I‚Äôm coming off as either extraordinarily happy or cynical. 

The early moths of social distancing were great for me, I felt like everyone was doing the same things as me and for the first time my withdrawn lifestyle didn‚Äôt seem as depressing to me. I now can‚Äôt get myself to do the things that inspire me. My dream career now seems so far out of reach that I can‚Äôt even get myself to sit at my piano for more than 15 minutes. I can‚Äôt even get myself to call my therapist because I feel as though I should just be able to get my act together. I‚Äôm so overwhelmed by all the small challenges of life. I just don‚Äôt want to wake up tomorrow, to another day of pushing away all my responsibilities and ruminating in bed all day. I wish my parents weren‚Äôt around so I could just end it all without causing them to suffer because of me. I just hope I get hit by a truck or something, but for that to happen, I would have to leave my flat. Which there is no real reason for, the next few days.

1: They say that there are plenty of fish in the sea. Yeah, well, sharks are fish and you seldom find calm waters within a sea of monsters. 

2: ‚ÄúIt is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.""

3: Never trust someone who always has their phone in their hands and never replies. If they say that they never had time to talk or respond then it‚Äôs always a lie. The truth is that they simply never intended to make time for you. So when you hear that, walk away. You aren‚Äôt a priority for them so make someone else your priority. 

4: Everything that is, is absurd. 

5: Love is about appreciation; not possession.""

6: Everyone is free to think, feel, and express themselves in the way they want but they often don't realize that no one is obligated to listen. 

7: ‚ÄúLiving is no different than being dead if you're all alone."" 

8: ‚ÄúHappiness is real when shared.""

9: Sometimes, even with those that you love, you are merely lucky to get a minute of their time. So make every minute count. 

10: Not everyone wins. There‚Äôs no participation reward for living life. For there to be winners there have to be losers. Maybe someday that will change. 

11: You‚Äôre never too much for others, you are just too little for them. It hurts the hear that but you‚Äôll know who your friends are if they keep showing up for you everyday. 

12: It‚Äôs astounding how many people you lose when you simply stop texting or calling first. 

13: If it comes in hot, it comes out hot. That not applies to spicy food but also when you get angry. Try not to hurt others even if they hurt you.

Constantly for the last year I have been pretty alone because I moved from my parents home, but does not matter where I am, my hometown or the new city where I'm studying, because I feel that I don't connect with anybody. Everytime I think about how fake and opportunist people is I want to disappear (not literally hopefully). It's true that 4 years ago I had depression because I got cyberbullied but now I suffer from other mental conditions that are making difficult to have communication with my enviroment, but right now the only thing I'm able to feel is loneliness and a profound sadness. I'm not able to find people with the same interests, people who thinks and see things the same way as I do, or people that respect me and don't make me feel bad because we aren't compatible in our styles of humour or plans... I have an online friend but we have met just once because we live too far away. He's my best friend but I think that because of the distance between us and the differences between our lifes I do not feel him near me. 

The reason i made this post is not only to opening myself, it's also because I've read some of your posts and I relate soooooo much. I wanted to tell my situation to remind myself and the ppl who feels the same way as me that we are not completly alone. While reading the posts I related a lot so I think that feeling the same things and having similar situations to other ppl makes me feel accompanied.

Also I wanted to ask you some advice because I don't know how to deal with this situation, it's really frustrating. I enjoy when I'm alone but I do need making plans and feeling loved by my friends. I don't know what to do to make real friends that commit. Also I think that this situation is making me feel this sad because I haven't solved my previous disorders in a proper way. What do you think? Maybe a good first step is to going to therapy, but as I said before I have problems with communication, I don't feel like opening up with a stranger, I went to therapy some years ago because of aggresiveness but it wasn't useful at all. I wish I could deal with these things by myself but right now I can't but seeing a therapist is not the best option right now.

I feel I missed out on ""young love"" for lack of a better word and or a wild phase. Like sneaking out of my house to see a girl, kissing her in the hallway, the hypersexualized and carefree environment of youth, playing games like spin the bottle, staying up all night to talk to her and adventure, exploring abandoned places, school dances, etc.. 

Now it feels like all the girls are ready to settle down now. They already had there fun growing up with various relationships and or hookups. Now they want to settle down. I am nowhere near ready to settle down I never even started yet.  I feel I need a wild phase to cope with my youth I feel I lost. Not just hooking up even though that is a big part of it. I want adventure and life experience to make memories. I'm not sure how exactly to put it into words hopefully that made sense.

 I am just having a huge problem of not being able to get out of my head. Since middle school seeing everyone else in relationships, hooking up, and or making memories with friends while you're left alone wondering whats wrong with me really messes with a persons head. It keeps me from getting things done in life.

He was drunk I guess but I know he's a good guy but everyone says he's a bad person even though he's not in my opinion. I don't know who to believe to be honest and it's making me stressed.

I also have a problem where I bottle to many negative emotions and once that overflows I lash out. My little sister was poking me while I was cleaning my room and for some reason I lashed out and yelled at her then left the room and started crying. What's wrong with me. I'm too scared to get help because my mom will think it's stupid or she'll ask about everything and that's already making me uncomfortable just thinking about it.

Thinking leads to overthinking and that leads to remembering my regrets. I think about that if I said something different, act different things could‚Äôve been different.

I've always been alone through all my ups and downs. I've found unhealthy ways to cope but now I've ran out of ways to hide this hurt in me. This need for genuine affection and care that I never got. I'm just teenager, but sometimes I feel like adult stuck in a child's body. I want complex things that I can't get from my peers, they never really like me. They don't like the things I like, they are just teenagers engrossed in gossip end drama. I don't blame them but I wonder why they treat me with such harsh cruelty. 

You know, sometimes I wish I could be like them. Have all these friends, always laugh, have somebody to talk to at Lunch and get a bite to eat after school. I've always wanted that, but I never seem to get it. I'm met with cold isolation. 

When I get home I'm met with a very hurt and complex woman that tends to be very hot tempered and judgemental. So my feelings are all compressed and hidden away until I meet my bedroom and let the tears out.

Like I felt like I was that kid sitting all alone again. I tried going to a party once and that was just a nightmare, I ended up sitting on the couch alone and I completely dissociated. I‚Äôm still young and I‚Äôm going to college soon, I just hope I can eventually ‚Äúpop‚Äù my ‚Äúpsychic bubble‚Äù but I doubt it.",lonely,On the outside,2020-06-25 11:27:48

I haven't posted on Reddit before. I am a 22y/o female and I moved to the United States for school. I started dating an American man about 1.5 years ago. I think our relationship is over now. My mom passed away last year and now my dad has esophageal cancer and his odds aren't looking too great. It is a very deadly cancer and although very rare, the 6th most responsible for cancer deaths worldwide.   


I am really scared for my dad. I had two friends here in the United States but both moved to different states recently. I go to University, but because of COVID-19 I do not have in person classes. I lost my mom, I am losing my boyfriend, and I might lose my dad soon. I don't have any family in the states and no friends near. I feel so scared and alone. Any advice is welcome. The places I would normally go for distraction, like class, study groups, workshops, the gym, etc, are all still closed. I am left alone with my heartbreak, my fear. I have to study from home but I cant concentrate and am so heartbroken and alone and there is nothing that has made me feel better. I feel so alone.

This might be a long post so thank you for taking the time out to read and giving your opinion :)

Backstory- So I have this friend who I‚Äôm super close with (you can say we were best friends) but lately he started being too critical  and it was getting annoying. Every time I‚Äôd call him, he‚Äôd make feel like an idiot. He would literally pick up the smallest mistake I‚Äôd make (sometimes not even mistakes) and make fun of it or be critical to the point that it‚Äôd leave me feeling dull. You could tell he started having a sense of superiority over me. Maybe because he‚Äôs studying in one of the most prestigious universities in the country I guess (he didn‚Äôt earn his spot there, he got a reserved seat). I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs about his university because I noticed him talk about how superior his uni is over mine. I study in a reputed uni too but it‚Äôs not as popular as his. Either way, he left me feeling with very low self esteem and I‚Äôd think twice before calling him or answering his calls. I started speaking a little slower than my natural speed so that I could analyse what I was about to say before actually saying it. Now that I think about it....it‚Äôs just sad. 
So I decided to confront him about it and he straight up said that he‚Äôs like this and if I can‚Äôt accept him for how he is, then I shouldn‚Äôt talk to him. 
Side note, he was critical and manipulative enough to make you believe he‚Äôs right and even though I hate saying this, but he has a way with words and that‚Äôs impressive.
So after this fight, we didn‚Äôt talk for like two weeks and he was the one who called me back to make up. We called truce, but I noticed that he was acting different
1. He tried making me feel bad about confronting him.
2. He legit stopped texting me. I tried making things go back to normal but he‚Äôd keep leaving me on seen and keep giving me one word answers.
3. And now, we only call each other once a week, whereas, we‚Äôd call each almost everyday before the fight.
In the beginning I tried making things go back to normal but every time I called him, he‚Äôd say he was busy (we were still in lockdown back then and I‚Äôm pretty sure he wasn‚Äôt THAT busy) and said that it‚Äôs better if we only called each other once a week.

So...now coming to why I‚Äôm thinking I should walk away from this friendship.
I picked up reading this quarantine and have been reading and watching a lot of videos on mindfulness, self love and acceptance. And every book and video had two things  in common.
They all said that you should accept what you have and should be grateful for it.
And the other thing is to train yourself to not get phased by what others think of you.
I watched a video where this guy says that to overcome your fear of being judged by others, you should take your biggest insecurity and put it out to the world.
So... I did. I took my biggest insecurity-my mental health and posted about it on my Instagram story. Only two people knew about it before. After a couple of hours, I started having second thoughts so to vent and get some support, I decided to call my friend. 
I told him about the two points that was common in every book and video and he says-
‚ÄúBeing positive and grateful all the time is not the answer‚Äù. I asked him to explain him point (I knew he was selling bs) and he goes on to say that if you‚Äôre grateful for what you have then you won‚Äôt work for something better. 
And you can‚Äôt be positive all the time because that‚Äôs literally not possible, and then he takes an example of a kid with cancer saying that 
1. He won‚Äôt be able to stay positive and if he says that he‚Äôs positive then that‚Äôs just denial.
2. He wouldn‚Äôt be grateful for his life because he didn‚Äôt get to live it in its entirety 

After that, that I made a mistake by posting about my mental health on social media and there‚Äôs nothing I could do about it. 
I would‚Äôve accepted everything that he said but idk why...I decided to call another friend of mine. Maybe because I was unsatisfied with his answer. 
I noticed a stark difference between both of their answers. The other friend that I called was supportive and that‚Äôs just what I needed instead of being called stupid and a philosophy lesson.
I‚Äôm all for constructive criticism but that didn‚Äôt sound like constructive criticism to me.
In that moment I felt for the first time that maybe  I‚Äôm in a toxic friendship.
The other friend also said that my ‚Äúbestfriend‚Äù has a very pessimistic outlook towards life and was always very critical of what people do.

What should I do?

[Dear Loneliness](https://www.dearloneliness.com/) is a crowd-sourced art exhibit, research study, and archival effort that‚Äôs inviting as many individuals as possible to write about their experiences with isolation. My friends and I started it to memorialize this year of strife and isolation while also connecting lonely people through art‚Äîwith your permission, these letters will be archived as both a record of the COVID-19 era and a crucial source of academic data.

You can submit letters, poetry, art, music, etc., and we hope to receive 1,000+ submissions for this dataset to better research loneliness; we‚Äôll be posting the submissions anonymously on our online gallery and social media. I‚Äôm not a licensed therapist at all, but for what it‚Äôs worth, many of my friends who participated have called writing these letters quite therapeutic. You can also read about the vision for the final art exhibit on our website (tl;dr it involves a lot of mirrors, letters, and an infinity of loneliness that creates community in the process).

For more information and to send us work, please visit [https://www.dearloneliness.com/](https://www.dearloneliness.com/) or tag us on social media (links are on the website)‚Äîthank you, sending you virtual hugs, and hoping you feel a little less alone today!",lonely,Help write the world‚Äôs longest letter to loneliness!,2020-06-25 00:12:38

I know the solution is to look beyond the flaws and appreciate people for the good in them. I have a few friends I value but they aren't close by.

As the cases are rising like crazy in Arizona, I‚Äôm out of things to do at home so I thought I‚Äôd come up with a comparison of some dating apps that I‚Äôve been using and hopefully this somewhat helpful for some of you guys.

(6 Months) Tinder: Got a lot of matches in the first two weeks and then nothing afterwards, paid $15 bucks for the GOLD and didn‚Äôt change anything. I think I‚Äôve only went out with 2 girls from it after paying.

(10 Months) SweetRing: I‚Äôm currently paying $25/month for this app and went out with about 8 girls from the app. You don‚Äôt get unlimited likes but you do get more connected conversations with people and I think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs easier to actually meet them IRL.

(9 Months) Bumble: Decent app. Paid $13/month but it feels weird when people swiped right on you but did not talk to you at all and there‚Äôs nothing you can do. Went out with 3 girls from the app.

(2 Months) CMB: Basically a weird app with a weird logic. Cost me $25 bucks for 3000 beans, which allowed me to ‚Äúlike‚Äù 7 attractive girls and of course none of them responded.

(3 Months) JD: It works pretty well for a hook-up dating app. it‚Äôs $40/month but you‚Äôll be able to talk dirty or find someone to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with pretty easily. Hung out with 6 girls so far.

(Less than 1 Month) Badoo: Great dating app if you are trying to date bots. One of the worst!

(Less than 1 Month) Plenty of fish: Full of fake accounts, bots and weird people. Also, one of the worst!

For some reason, free versions don‚Äôt really work that well for me, picking the right apps and paying for them isn‚Äôt that big of a deal for me as long as they can provide some sort of results. What are some other apps that I should review next?

Edit: I kind of travel a lot because of my job. I live in Arizona, but constantly traveling to California, New York, Taiwan. Please do share your experiences if you feel like a certain apps are doing extremely well/worse in your location.",lonely,Mid 2020 dating apps review,2020-06-24 17:33:02

See me and my best friend fell in love in high school and we didn‚Äôt want to ruin our friendship but we believed we were soulmates so we knew eventually we would come back together later in life. The whole reason I broke up with my girlfriend was because of my best friend (I‚Äôm bisexual). I broke up with her because I couldn‚Äôt get over him (my best friend) and I felt guilty knowing I still loved him. I stopped talking to him for 2 weeks while I was in that relationship and when I came back to him he cried and said he‚Äôs never missed anyone more and that he cried every night. He‚Äôs now In a relationship with a boy (hes bi too) and he‚Äôs overly in love. He‚Äôs been in this relationship since I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend and explained that he only got into the relationship to fill the void of me being in one. He said he also cried about me being in a relationship when I first got with her. It‚Äôs weird to me because I thought he was my soulmate and parts of me still believe that. But I‚Äôm being led on? We‚Äôve talked about it and he‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs in love with his boyfriend but that him and I will come back together maybe in retirement. I‚Äôm sorry? What kind of statement is that. Our whole lives we‚Äôve been there for each other and now he‚Äôs all about this boy. I have nobody else to turn to and I feel like I‚Äôm truly losing him no matter what. Even with our efforts. He claims he still cares for me but wow. I‚Äôm working on myself so that I don‚Äôt have my happiness depend on others but I still feel like I need support in this process. 

I don‚Äôt know exactly what Kind of response I‚Äôm hoping to get but talking to anyone would be a great help. I feel like I need something right now because I feel low.",lonely,I have nothing to lose anymore,2020-06-24 16:10:00

Multiple instances pop up, and then continue to do so, sending me into a spiral- reliving those moments in the kind of vivid detail only my mind would allow. And as much as opening those wounds does hurt, I do it over, and over, and over.. because the only thing that scares me anymore, is repeating my mistakes. I know what I want in life, and I know all the reasons I will never have it. What I don't know is, what I'm waiting for. I nearly succeeded in killing myself 11 years ago with a hand grenade. Came home from school to find the bomb squad at my house. And when they detonated that grenade, I did feel something deep within me. I didn't know it at the time, but it was regret. I don't think I was ever meant to be here.. and checking out early certainly would have saved me from a lot. In the years since, my suicidal tendencies have not let up, and for every day that I never committed, I felt more and more ashamed of myself. Felt like a flake who couldn't commit to life or death.

Is there a way out? I loved you, but it was never something I would have told you. I don‚Äôt know why they told you how I felt, I trusted them and they just couldn‚Äôt keep it a secret. I never wanted you to hate me, I know you don‚Äôt say it but I could tell just by looking at you. I failed you, at least for me you were my friend but I had to like in that way. I hate myself for doing that to you, you deserve someone so much better to like you, I‚Äôm sorry. I was so stupid to ever think someone could like me, but for some reason I thought you did. I was wrong but now I know the truth, I‚Äôm not supposed to be liked and even if I hate that truth I have to live with it. You were everything I had for so long, but I failed you. You probably never cared but it felt like it. I‚Äôm sorry I believed that could happen, it was stupid. Clearly you just wanted to spend time with someone who wouldn‚Äôt get mad with you, and I understand. I can‚Äôt get mad with people because they are so good that I know they‚Äôll do better next time, but you liked that, and for some reason you couldn‚Äôt let me go with anyone else. Why?? I don‚Äôt know why you wanted me to stay with you every time, to not go with anyone else. I‚Äôm wrong, I thought you kind of liked me, but it was impossible not only for you but everyone. You saved me when I was in such a dark place, I don‚Äôt know why you did this but I‚Äôm grateful I got such an awesome friend. This just an apology for what I felt I hope you can forgive me one day. I‚Äôm sorry for making that stupid decision. I‚Äôm sorry for losing you. I‚Äôm sorry for not telling you, and letting those people tell you. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have trusted them, but I still care about them, or maybe I don‚Äôt want to be left out even though none of you cared. I lost you, the only friend I thought I had, but you were only my friend while you weren‚Äôt fighting those people. Now you have a reason to not be my friend and you took it, I understand why you did it. I know I‚Äôm not good looking, intelligent, special or anything someone could like. Now when I remember everything we have talked and everything we have done I see that you were never interested in even knowing me. You were just passing the time and I won‚Äôt blame you I think leaving me and not wanting to be near me is the best thing you could have done.

A couple of years ago I had to cut off contact with the best friend I've ever had, because she started to hang with toxic people that we had previously agreed never to associate with again, and then she herself started to turn into them, and all I could do was sit and watch as she changed from the person I loved. She was practically my only friend, my other 'friends' had disagreed with my desicion to move countries to pursue dreams and to be with my husband, so had cut me off years prior. Some were cruel about it, and I had to cut them out in turn, although it hurt like hell to do so. 
I've struggled since losing her cause I want to be her friend again but I know things would never be the same, and the friendship would never be right. And I know its cause I miss what we had but it hurts so much.

And a friend that I've leaned on for support during all that is now going in her own direction in life, and wont be around anymore. And as much as im thrilled for her that shes living the life she wants, and I support her 1000%, I feel even more lost, with no friends and feeling like I failed at everything, even if I was trying to protect myself from toxic people after having a form of abusive childhood. 
I have no idea where to turn or what to do, except just potter about on my evenings with nothing to do. The closest bonds I've ever had were formed online to start, because meeting people at hobby classes and similar places just isnt the same :/

611,hopefullysomeday2k,1592967348,1,"First, life‚Äôs full of problems. I have lots of them, especially ones associated with my loneliness. Just read my posts, you‚Äôll see. I‚Äôve been extremely depressed. But aren‚Äôt we all. Life is full of problems, so what? So we have to manage them. Problems don‚Äôt go away, you simply trade one set of problems for another. A poor man has financial issues, so does a rich man. Different problems but they‚Äôre still present. 

Today I was supposed to meet up with some people that I met this past Saturday, at the very same spot I met them. But of course, no one opens their snapchat messages, and people got their own lives. It wasn‚Äôt set in stone, so it didn‚Äôt happen. I wasn‚Äôt surprised. So I just went by self and read my book. This book is where I‚Äôm getting all this information, the title is ‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck‚Äù. I think we all need to read this book. The lessons are invaluable. I had a thought after I finished another chapter.

I think you can agree with this premise. Premise: life is full of pain, emotional and physical. Both of which can strengthen us, and make us more resilient. Now to my idea. It‚Äôs painful walking up to random people and initiating conversation, trying to form a connection. But it‚Äôs also painful watching idly by, doing nothing. I may not be at fault for my shitty social situations and how others have treated me in the past, just as you are not at fault for any medical condition or social anxiety you have that impedes your social life. But we are responsible for how we react and what we choose to do. Let‚Äôs say I wanna approach a hot knockout girl. Realistically, she isn‚Äôt gonna think I‚Äôm some stalker out to get her, or some creepy dude trying to get her digits. But whatever she thinks, it shouldn‚Äôt affect me because I‚Äôve based my values on what I accomplish and what I know I‚Äôm capable of. Not something that‚Äôs outside of my control (whether I score on that hottie or not). People who determine they‚Äôre worth, or attribute how they feel to the feedback they receive from others possess an external locust of control. It‚Äôs extremely unhealthy, will fuck you up, and keep you from living a happy life. It hasn‚Äôt worked for me.

Now that I‚Äôve taken responsibility, and reworked my shitty values, I can put into practice my new values. Now I‚Äôll experience some positive growth. Now back to my idea, life includes exchanging one pain or stress for another. When I walk up to that hot girl to try and get a conversation going, or ask for her number, I risk experiencing the pain of rejection. You know what else is painful, watching idly doing nothing. In fact, this particular pain lasts much longer. Even if that girl rejects me in front of her friends, who fucking cares? I‚Äôm never gonna see her again. BUT if I do see her again, it‚Äôll be a result of my bravery and my willingness to take action and say ‚Äúfuck it, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù The possibility of a future date or a new friend, it‚Äôs a total win! Didn‚Äôt work out? That‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs positive experience you can grow from, still a win. The only time you lose is when you DON‚ÄôT act. You don‚Äôt grow in those moments, and the pain is deeper and lasts much longer than a short sting of rejection. Plus you‚Äôll never know unless you try.

Remember the premise? This pain of rejection will make you stronger, you will grow from it. I know it‚Äôs fucking tough to believe, but it becomes easier. You will evolve. I‚Äôve been open with everyone here. I want my own tribe of friends. That‚Äôs not gonna fall on my lap, it‚Äôs gonna take action from me and development of my character. I acknowledge what I‚Äôm doing will be painful at first, but in the end it‚Äôs rewarding. Here‚Äôs the cherry on top, it is positive to pursue a negative experience, and negative to pursue a positive experience. That‚Äôs called the backwards law, and you grow when you‚Äôre challenged. Think of a workout, you‚Äôre enduring pain for the better. With all this said, every day from now on I‚Äôll ask a girl for her number, or try to have some decent conversation, then ask. I acknowledge it‚Äôs gonna be painful, but it‚Äôs the pain I‚Äôve chosen. What‚Äôs equally important and will help me through this process are the values I‚Äôve established for myself. Now I‚Äôll be growing and learning from this pain. Holy fuck, eventually I‚Äôll be bulletproof. So challenge yourself and take some steps forward, it will be better than staying in the same spot, never moving forward, watching who you could‚Äôve become. That‚Äôs my worst fear and biggest pain, not living up to my potential. If I‚Äôm no longer growing, then I may as well be dead. All learning and development ceases upon death.

I was originally going to write a lengthy guide for all of us out here on r/lonely on taking responsibility and accepting the bitter truths. But I think this will suffice. All my information came from this book which I‚Äôve almost finished: https://imgur.com/gallery/XZHFbTr just 2 chapters to go! There‚Äôs much more to these all encompassing concepts than what I typed here. So please, help yourself and equip yourself with the tools to improve your own life. ‚ÄúThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck‚Äù is such a resourceful tool to hone your thinking. Feel free to message any time. I‚Äôll be starting an accountability journal tracking my progress approaching women. You will find these posts on the r/selfimprovement and my own u/hopefullysomeday2k page. I would post it here, but right now I don‚Äôt think it would be fitting. I love you all.

She's really fair weather on top of this and ignores my messages for days but when she needs someone to vent to I'm expected to always be there. then my other friend is constantly projecting on me or feels like I'm attacking him cause of the trauma he's dealt with in his life. I was watching Shrek üòÇ on my phone one night winding down after drinking and he tells me that it's triggering him and that I was being an asshole for watching it which.....is fucking ridiculous.  I started therapy a few weeks ago trying to better myself and I'm just getting more and more fed up with their negativity and how they put me down without even realizing it. I suffer from PTSD and am terrified of being alone but I'm realizing I'm already alone. My therapist keeps talking about how I should go back to work (I haven't worked in two years) to make friends but my mental illness makes that impossible. And when I try to make new friends and bring up I'm in therapy for trauma they treat me like I'm some psycho and just quit talking to me.

I have been struggling so hard to study and I am not ready at all for the upcoming exams. I feel like not only I'm having to deal with the grief of the loss and the stress of failing my year but also there's the sting of loneliness that's creeping it's way in my brain again. I reached out to two ""close"" friends of mine because the stress was becoming too much and none of them tried to make me feel better about any of this all. They casually brushed it off and haven't checked on me ever since I talked to them. I have gone off social media for approximately 3 days because I simply didn't have time (visits, funeral preparations, spending time with family members, studying as much as I can..) and also off any gaming platform... so I haven't had any interaction with anything of the sort nor anyone, I stopped sending my ""friends"" memes, stopped sharing songs,... and no one seems to have noticed my disappearance. I understand that most of them also may be under pressure because of the exams or just also not having any time to reach out, but still it hurts that no one cares to ask about what's going on with me. Especially those 2 friends that I have opened up to about it. I already always felt lonely but got to a point where I was content with 5 friends and acquaintances... turns out I was still lonely all along and really don't have anyone that's truly there for me like I am for them (or at least cares).",lonely,They don't seem to care,2020-06-24 08:25:09

I tried posting on a few different subreddits, I even put up a picture and I did not get much back or I fucked it up.

Not sure what to do with myself and how to deal with being so withdrawn I just want to cuddle with someone one night.

I usually cope by playing video games, but my pc broke and I won't have it until tomorrow and I thought I would just, go for a walk. It was a bad idea. Seeing everyone talking together, forming bonds etc... It just had me have a breakdown.

I realized that I'm craving for those social interactions, to meet new people, but IRL, not online. The worst is seeing all those couples. I don't feel jealous or anything, I'm really happy for them, but it really made me realize that all I want is to socialize with others, and possibly find someone that I can spend my days with.

The problem is, I can't talk to people. I just feel paralyzed when I want to. Just trying get into a bar makes me feel dizzy. I feel like everyone will think I'm a weirdo, that I don't belong here or anywhere else. What if I bother people trying to talk to them. This kind of thoughts... If people goes to me, I can talk back, but I cannot make the first step or enter alone a crowded place with mostly groups of people hanging out (but maybe that's normal idk). And I don't really have anyone to go with.

So I was just there, on a bench in a tiny park at night, close to where students in my city hangs out with their friends, watching them going by with their life while questioning myself about how I got that panicked about connecting with others. I really want to change, to get my life back together and to stop being afraid of others.

643,TonyBonaparte,1592945506,2,"Hi guys I have been without friends for around four years I was perfectly OKAY in fact I was proud of not needing friends until recently that is. 
I‚Äôve read that we are biologically wired to crave social interactions and about skin hunger too. 
It also seems that loneliness is cumulative in other words the longer time you spend lonely the worse it feels. 
Now I have a pain in my chest that lasts for DAYS all day every day and it feels really bad. 
I‚Äôve got another problem which is that I am a shy introvert AND I find it hard to connect with people I am incompatible with. 
Honestly this really sucks but it seems you cannot openly talk about it because of the incel guys now anyone craving social interactions or suffering from skin hunger is a fucking murderous psycho undeserving of any sort of empathy. Also people use the term ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù to disregard your feelings and your need to connect with people and reject you based on it. 
I am not a misogynist and I am not jealous either, in fact I have always supported slutty behavior but it is very obvious that lonely desperate men outnumber lonely desperate women. 
I want to make friends and would like to make female friends because I am bored of male friends it‚Äôs very monotonous and feminine energy is always helpful and necessary to cover a wide spectrum of human personalities and connections I do have male friends some male friends but no female friends at all and because my friends hold the view that having female friends is beta I cannot know any women. 
I hope you won‚Äôt bash me or something but I will soon start my first job in a foreign country and this feeling in my chest is very strong I am moving to the UK and everyone knows the UK is one of the loneliest countries in the world there‚Äôs a loneliness epidemic there. 
I was very enthusiastic about getting a job and I am in love with my specialty and my potential career but honestly if there‚Äôs no one I can talk to I don‚Äôt see the point. 
People say one only wants female friends because they want to fuck I kinda see the point there but anyone can hire a sex worker for that purpose. 
That being said yes I feel the skin hunger I didn‚Äôt know it was a real thing until I saw it is a physiological phenomenon, but skin hunger is not the same as sex. 
I hope I won‚Äôt be judged for the comment on sex workers or the comment on me being supportive of slutty behavior or making it known that I am mainly interested in female friendship. 
I also like male friendships AND I have spent a lot of my years learning english, constantly improving my skills and looking to reach near-native fluency in vocabulary and flow of speech but because I am not american/English I feel very rejected it‚Äôs like my life doesn‚Äôt matter that‚Äôs how I felt in the UK at least and yes people say why don‚Äôt you talk to people from your country or other Europeans but that‚Äôs very discriminatory and when someone spends time learning a language in depth they are not only driven by the need to communicate they also have an admiration or appreciation of certain western values personified by the american spirit or Australian/Canadian/English spirit even if countries such as the UK and the US are leaning towards fascism, racism and social Darwinism which is a shame but I those are not the Anglo Saxon values I defend I believe in a progressive America. 
I am pro sex work, pro choice, a prison abolitionist and a social democrat. 
I don‚Äôt support quotas. 
I don‚Äôt support the red pill BUT I have read their theories never fully believed in it but have at some points. 
Sometimes I follow the manosphere due to some sort of fascination with sociology, radicalization of young males and internet culture. 
I am against toxic masculinity but think it hides a bit of misandry and does not explain everything regarding men‚Äôs problems. 
I am an atheist but would like to join the universalist church and don‚Äôt discard spiritual perspectives of the world by which I mean accepting the mystery of the nature of consciousness/reality. 
I would like to be polyamorous but they are very closed circles and they seem to reject single/lonely people which is a prevalent problem across all sections of society. 
I am pro immigration but support borders that being said I think we should make it easier for people to achieve legal immigration status and increase their employability. 
I am all for diversity and think that diversity matters, but don‚Äôt support quotas although I am willing to change my mind. 
I support Andrew Yang and also admit that men are very isolated which makes them vulnerable to alt-right extremism, I detest trump and johnson and think they reflect the worse side of US/UK cultures. 
My interests are: 
-Philosophy of physics 
-Computer science 
-Music composition

Ive been very antisocial since young and I do enjoy my own company but lately Ive been feeling really lonely, I had friends as a kid and kind of lost touch when I moved and started my final years of high school and college (which I never managed to find friends in) but I was still young and all I really felt was boredom, after college I joined the military and it was great I made loads of friends and everything was getting really good but through my own choice decided to leave I just hated the job, so I left after 5 years of getting used to having friends and getting out of my shell then I moved into my own place and got a new job. 

its been 1 year and I have not made any friends. Sometimes I get really depressed when I look at my life im 25 never been in a relationship and have no friends or people I can reach out to other than my parents and I have no idea how to change it, when I think about putting myself out there for relationships or looking for friends I get so nerves and scared that it literally makes me sick, its like Ive completely repressed and gone back into my shell.

660,htsun,1592934185,1,"Hey there,

I've been living abroad (Southeast Asia) for more than a year, and I'm experiencing what some people call Expat loneliness. I'm what you could say an introvert mostly, but with extrovert characteristics at times - I don't get put off by large crowds, I don't mind starting the casual small talk with strangers even if awkward, and I manage to get out of my comfort zone pretty easily. I'm in my early thirties, I don't worry about being on my own or doing my own stuff most of the time, and on the other side of the spectrum, I enjoy pushing myself into social situations, despite having social anxiety.

However, somehow it has been very hard to create any sort of connection with anyone - I'm from a non-English European country and most Expats here are native English teachers (USA, UK, etc), whereas I work as a designer, which I find to be a major reason for not having created any solid common ground with anyone. I am renting a place of my own and I did join as much stuff as I could from early on - from Crossfit to local language classes, events for social causes to casual beers on a Friday night - many in order to find some sort of tribe or group of friends to fit into, but to no avail.   
I do have some local friends and a couple of expat friends from work, but they seem to be at different stages in life than I am (married w/ kids or older with established social circles already).

What made me write this was going out for a beer on my own on a Monday after work, and seeing all these groups (locals and expats) around me enjoying what it seems a pretty healthy social life, and me not having one good friend I could invite over to drink a few and talk sh\*t. These thoughts happen quite often, but today was just a bit too much. I also just got into a relationship recently, but even being with her I can't shake off this kind of feeling.  
Sometimes it would be cool to just know who's also lonely around, invite them for a beer and well, not make an elephant-in-the-room out of it. And no, Tinder has a completely different purpose.

Any expat (or not) here who experienced the same?

tl;dr I've been living abroad (Southeast Asia) for more than a year, and I'm experiencing Expat loneliness for not having meaningful friendships.",lonely,"Mostly introvert, difficulty creating meaningful connections, and experiencing Expat loneliness",2020-06-24 03:43:05

Somehow I feel like I'm trapped in a prison built up by societal norms where I can't do anything I want to, or else everyone is going to chastise me about it. ""BoooHooo! Someone's not getting the same attention on facebook. What a dweeb!"" Yeah, that might be true but, shit man, it sucks to feel like this. Constantly comparing myself to other more articulate people sucks. Just seeing them post about their day living the best out of quarantine sucks. I hate that I have to do that everytime! All that is because my living situation isn't as good as theirs and I don't have friends to even make up for it. 

You know what they used to say, that friends always makes every situation better? Well, I don't have those and my life couldn't be any worse. I could probably go try messaging a random person in my contacts again, but I'm afraid that they'd ignore me just as well as in person. I admit that I'm no charming person but there should've been someone who at least gave me a chance... 

Now I have no one to talk to. I even cancelled my online appointments with my mental health counselor because he just shrugged off this issue so easily. Being lonely sucks. Being like this sucks...

When I am not at work, I am at home, or, occasionally, at the mall, alone, or with my girlfriend.

I go to maybe 4 parties a year with the people that I went to highschool with. I don't talk with them ever, unless there is a party coming up.

Keeping up with people seems really exhausting, and I really am too socially anxious to go and socialize at a bar or wherever.

I feel meaningless, like I don't matter, I don't know what to do. I kinda want to kill myself too. 

I won't, but it would be easier.

I'm a uni student in my mid-twenties. I split up with my long term gf last October after which I had to move back home. Almost all of my close friends are in relationships.

674,forgot_username321,1592922519,7,"I have a binary mindset on people not a spectrum.

I either care about them like crazy as in I keep checking my phone for messages, write long messages, am very kind to them, and overly forgiving of their mistakes.

I think it may be because I want to be the type of person there for someone like me who is lonely. I know that at times, I isolate myself and make dumb, rude decisions. So, I want to be forgiving of someone who does so. 

It‚Äôs also because I have this fantasy of having a best friend - a friend that will be there for me forever and will hear my problems out. I tend to be vulnerable, so I open up fast. I just want to vent out bad bc I‚Äôve felt bottled up with constant worries before.

I‚Äôve known people who were very affectionate and I kept hearing how important the quality (kindness and understanding) is. So, I naturally wanted to project it. I wanted to be a wholesome person - someone good. Maybe it was to make myself better that in a world with many people who genuinely don‚Äôt care, I could be a better person. But I took it to the extreme. I‚Äôm too nice. I don‚Äôt like that. I easily forgive mistakes people make. I don‚Äôt think people can respect me if I maintain this behavior.

I just get so emotionally attached when I think there‚Äôs a possibility I can be good friends with someone. Expectations lead to disappointment and hopelessness.

So then there‚Äôs a pessimistic mindset.

I isolate myself. I don‚Äôt trust anyone. I hate everyone. I think everyone secretly looks down on me. I think everyone has something against me. I think everyone ignores/doesn‚Äôt care for me. I become passive-aggressive. 

I‚Äôm like those little children who want attention but are making a fuss that they aren‚Äôt getting it and are too embarrassed to admit that they want it. 

So, I just saw the bad in people. But when I try to see people‚Äôs good qualities, I start downplaying their bad qualities and am not able to see things realistically.",lonely,How to not be overly trusting when lonely?,2020-06-24 00:28:39

I have zero friends, I have no social life, I never get a single text/call/snapchat from anyone, and it's been like this since my freshman year of highschool. In highschool I was that creepy loser that no one talked to and everyone thought I was going to be a school shooter. I ate lunch in the bathroom or library or wandered around the school for every single lunch period except for a week at the start of freshman year. I didn't make a single friend in high school. I never once hung out with anyone, I didn't go to any dances, I didn't even get a single text from anyone except for 2 that involved school projects. All in all I'd say I had maybe 15 conversations with classmates that weren't about school. It was fairly common for me to go days at a time without talking to anyone, and sometimes even weeks if teachers weren't included. On top of all of this, I had severe anxiety and depression which were mostly untreated. To make things worse, my home life was awful. My parents were really strict and controlling and never let me do anything. I was constantly yelled at and blamed for things and forced to do a mind boggling amount of chores that was far far beyond what any child should be expected to do. And over the past two years, I've become consumed by loneliness and despair and developed a crippling adderall addiction to help cope with the pain. My social situation is basically the same as it was in high school. Nothings changed. I hate myself so much. I am completely socially retarted after being isolated for so long and I have no idea what to do. And a relationship is just out of the question because who in there right mind would love me? What do I offer? Boredom and mental emotional instability? Pretty much. And everyone loses interest in me after a while.

688,ixoxo23,1592902200,1,"Apologize for poor grammar/english in advanced.

Sooo when I was in high school I had a lot of friends - from school, dance, online etc. 
I had no problem making friends and I always tho how blessed I am with that part of my life. 

Then I left my town and went to university and everything changed. I still meet a lot of people but it seems I cant make any genuine connection and I have hard time maintaing any relationships.

I met so many people on uni, associations, thro other people. I have social skills, I'm not awkward person and I'm mostly extraverted. 

I have 2 friends at the moment with whom I can spend my time with, but we dont share some common interest (like gym, gaming, partying, shopping, music), which I would like to have company for it. 

I was working in several places but literally with no one made some kind of connection or stayed in contact after I stopped working. 

I'm volonturing on one place at the moment and I met few people I really like but they dont have time to hang out (or they donr like me same way) outside of that.

I live with 4 roomates, 2 of them are older and work all time - one I dont like at all, other I like and we hang out sometimes, other one is never in apartment but we have calls, the last one refuses any social activities and seems very defensive when I'm around her.

So most of my days I spend on my laptop, playing games, watching streams or Youtube, alone in my room. I can be like this for days and it took me time to realize how lonely I've become and that I'm not okay with it.

I dont remember when was the last time I got a call to go on coffee or walk or something from someone new, except these 2 friends. 

I feel bad about myself that I have a problem I'm not aware of, and it's crushing my self esteem..

If someone has any advice I'll take it, because I've tried everything what was on my mind and as I said, I meet new people often and talk to them but it doesnt seem I click with anyone on deeper level to connect more later on..

I basically lived in a bedroom day and night when not working and it would have been impossible in part because it was too expensive to afford rent until after graduate school.

The only friends I saw were a few from high school that still saw me once or twice a year and a few I had in college that all later moved on. 

They since have stopped including me in any activities. I never made friends in college because I went to a commuter school and not at work because I have changed jobs so much.

After quarantine started, all of that went away. School is over now, and doing e-learning in the fall makes me extremely nervous. I'm not sure I'll do well.

For context, I was bullied a lot in high school, and sadly, I didn't get proper psychological treatment or time to heal before going to college for the first time... So things went downhill after that.

Drifted away from many friends, got misdiagnosed with Asperger's (at the time I thought I had it), and told almost everyone I knew about it, fucking my entire life, and they started to treat me more like a child or special needs person... 

Went to another college career, made the same mistake again, got treated like a child/special needs person again, and started to drift away from some internet, college and high school friends/acquaintances, either because of my fault, their fault, misunderstandings or just natural drifting.

Being frank, I have in between 18-22 enemies or people I don't get along with, eight of them being from college, and the rest were made before going to college thanks to the reasons mentioned above.

Those events destroyed most of my support network, leaving me almost alone. It made my depression and anxiety go back, and it made me suicidal.

I still think about death every single day, and sometimes the thoughts are so strong that I have to stay in bed and force myself to sleep to weaken them.

I've been to psychologists, psychiatrists, took pills, even I got a brain scan (thanks to it I found out I don't have Asperger's), but I don't seem to get better...

My family has tried to do their best, but they just don't understand...

My grandaunt told me that I should be grateful to have a family, since she didn't know her parents when she was younger, and that I just needed to become more positive.

My grandma told me almost in tears today that friends aren't real, and that I shouldn't worry if I don't have that many friends because of that.

My mom has tried to understand the most of them, but she told me that she doesn't understand why I care so much about friendship.

She even wanted to book me an appointment to a psychologist for $70 per hour (in my country, that's like spending $120 in the states). 

I didn't want to go, because I was deadly afraid that new psychologist wouldn't understand my situation, and I didn't want my mom to spend more money on me... I even deactivated some social media accounts like Facebook and Discord since I couldn't handle the truth...

To many of these people, I'm not a friend, and maybe not even an acquaintance... All I get is indifference, and bringing back past memories with some of them, knowing that I won't even be able to have a bond with them back made me feel broken and defeated.

So that's it, the reasons I'm lonely... Even so, I'm scared about online classes.

People asking for my help again and again, pretending they care, sometimes having to do most of the work myself because I didn't have the heart to say that they never did anything or barely worked, and I didn't want them to have a zero on an assignment...

Those are just classmates and acquaintances, I have almost no friends at my current college career, while most of them have at least one solid group of friends at minimum.

I'm tired of bearing this loneliness, I'm tired of being treated like I had Asperger's when I'm not, I regret all of the mistakes I've ever made...

Because, I'm afraid of dying alone as an old man... I've struggled with depression for seven years, and I don't know how much more I'll be able to bear...",lonely,Loneliness and not being understood by others hurt (Long Post),2020-06-23 12:46:19

The  last few years have been insanely lonely and entering 2nd year of  university that doesn't seem to be changing any time soon, I have a very  low self esteem and I really truly want to get better. But what seems  to be getting in the way is the embarrassment of the past and being  ashamed of it. It mostly stems from the idea that ""you were such a  loser, with no friends that sits at home all day the past few years what  makes you think you can be someone better?"". I've always found it hard  to let go of the past and this is a reoccurring thought that never seems  to go away. It's really a slippery slope of self deprecation and while I  have gotten better with managing these false ideas, they still manifest  themselves in some way despite my therapist saying that they're not  always true. An excellent example of this is 2 years ago I  wholeheartedly believed that EVERYONE I came into contact with intensely  hated me. Looking back, the evidence that I was basing that off was the  fact that absolutely nobody would hit me up to hang out and I never hit  anyone up cuz I thought it'd be ""weird"" to try to actively reach out to  people for some reason and summers were especially lonely and very  taxing to my mental health, which I'd imagine plunged me further into  this shit hole of this way of thinking.

I  went to therapy for a few months and we did some cbt and this toxic  idea has definitely been toned down but it still sometimes manifests  itself, but I have to tell myself that this isn't always true and this  idea is just off suspensions and baseless evidence (although there is  some real hard evidence though that actually supports this idea, which  is why I might still think this way)

Another  thing that's really demotivating is the fact that other people around  me seem to have such an easy time making friends while not really caring  about life in general tbh while I'm stuck in this ditch where making  and maintaining a friendship is so hard (i.e. keeping that person around  and having it blossom into a closer friendship)  that I feel like such  an awkward antisocial loser and despite analyzing my social interactions  with people and trying to pin point what I'm doing wrong, and trying to  address these ""shortfalls"" (although I perceive them as shortfalls, I  usually don't have a second opinion so I can never know if these  ""shortfalls"" really need to be addressed or I'm just over thinking a  minor detail or if I'm even addressing it properly) my situation never  seems to change.

Anyways,  I hope I didn't complain too much or provide many excuses to my  problems because at the end of the day, they're still my own problems  and nobody else's.",lonely,How to be better without being ashamed of the past,2020-06-23 11:03:48

728,rcavictorman57,1592871739,4,"I'm about to ask a question or two that relates to many people, but let me introduce myself, first. My name's Cody, and I've been single for idek HOW long anymore... At least two years. I'm 18 (though I have the thought process of a 60 yr old man), and I'm definitely average to just below average looking. I'm sorta plump, but not fat. My self worth is low at the moment, but ends up going high some times for whatever reason. For the past few months, I've been on several dating apps (6 to be exact, including a Christian one).

I feel helpless, trapped, and unworthy. My guts twist in agony as I even THINK about being single, and I want to cry out loud, but never do. I'm not a stud, and I'm not too too picky about what she looks like, but like everyone, I have some standards.  What I really want is love. Rock solid love. I have too much love to give to NOT give any, either. About the dating sites... I have 2 likes. One's fake, and the other, just isn't my type, it wouldn't last anyhow.

My questions... Have you ever been so lonely, that you're ashamed of it, and every happy couple you see, you want to be happy for them, but you're just jealous? You know you're worth being with someone, but you don't know how to talk to girls (or act around guys for female readers) My next question: Is there ANYBODY my age, who knows how I feel? You want to act young because you are, but yet you wasted your childhood because you grew up too young. 

Before I turned 18, I used yubo to find girls, and I added their snaps, and just acted as genuine as possible, and introduced myself. I'd get some to bite at times. I had good and bad days. My Pennsylvania Dutch way of talking to girls makes me sound dumb, but I still overcame it at times, and intrigued a gorgeous girl. That's when they asked what I looked like. I accept defeat at that point, because it always was defeat for me.

Excuse my desperate self, girls, but if you feel the same, please let me know. PS: like I said, I'm new to reddit, so I'm not sure what this community or whatever is actually about. In any case, ANY lonely person can relate to this, I hope. :/",lonely,"Lonely hearts, anyone? (If I'm doing this wrong, just know, I'm new here.)",2020-06-23 10:22:19

It just goes straight to dislike and hatred, just like recently my two old best friends both told me I was a waste of their time, so that decreased to only two people who I know were my best bros, then today he told me he hated me. So now all I have is Jacob, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going anywhere soon, but that‚Äôs how it was with others too. Let‚Äôs just hope nothing bad happens, I mean if I lost him too I would have no one in my life, maybe family maybe. But I want someone my age, someone I can relate to all the time, like Jacob. But I don‚Äôt just want him, don‚Äôt get me wrong he‚Äôs great and I wouldn‚Äôt be the person you know without him. But I want someone like that in school, someone I know will never leave me. I don‚Äôt know anymore at this point. I‚Äôm just scared and I feel so alone, it‚Äôs awful. It‚Äôs like something is slowly clawing away at my chest. Gnawing away at my emotions, I try so hard but it seems whenever I do something bad people just hate me straight away, maybe it‚Äôs how I walk talk look. Eh Idk, I know some people care though. I will always treasure them, but it‚Äôs not enough, call me greedy but I don‚Äôt want to always act like I don‚Äôt care, or try pretend but I think that‚Äôs what I am going to have to do to get people to not leave me maybe then they‚Äôll stay, I just don‚Äôt understand after 2-3 years of knowing each other they‚Äôd just go... I miss my only worries being getting up early, I had so many people who cared about me even a bit, they found me funny and enjoyed my company, maybe I have changed. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening anymore with anything. I think my auntie is okay with my now I hope but yes this hatred that people have for me includes my family it started with my older aunt, I won‚Äôt lie I love her to bits and she made her gift of a child William, my lil bro in my eyes anyway. But she never seemed to be too keen on me. Well not recently. But I‚Äôm over it... kinda. Everyone else is okay with me I hope. I just want to cry forever. 


Hey! Me again the next day kinda. Uhh so I have thought about it and I think I am ready to do the deed. I am just waiting for the right moment; not got anything planned yet but it‚Äôs probably gonna happen, I can‚Äôt do this very much longer. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm ready to go. Even if people are sad it‚Äôll only be for a month at most, heh I mean I doubt it would be that long but I hope it is everyone wants to be missed, it‚Äôs only natural I suppose. Uhh I mean I just need to figure out how first. Sure people will miss me but they all have other favourites, but not gonna lie it‚Äôs sad not being anyone‚Äôs favourite, like sure I have my mum but who else does she have to chose from? All my other friends well... friend have favourites. My family have theirs, Nanna has ghislaine, Nicol has William. William has his mum and dad. Dan has her kids which she definitely prefers. Grandad has all his other grandkids probably William, ghislaine has josh, Ava and Eddie have each other... then there‚Äôs me, viewing from outside everyone having each other as their best. I mean I thought I did but he told me he hated me yesterday so that‚Äôs out the window. I just wanna be someone‚Äôs favourite person at least just to know I am so special to someone, not also apart of something it was my dad but we know how that turned out; it makes it even worse because I see how great jacks parents treat him and it‚Äôs... almost unreal to me how lucky he is to have such caring parents, he told me when they heard he wanted to kill himself his father cried, I was so shocked. They care that much? When my parents first heard that they laughed seriously. When I told my auntie she got pissed at me told me I ruined her holiday and I just remember thinking when he told me his father cried... wow is that how it feels to truly be cared about? To have someone cry simply because I told them I wanted to kill my self it just seemed unreal to me. You know I wouldn‚Äôt even be typing this if I felt I was genuinely cared for. My best aunt who said she was like my older sister hasn‚Äôt talked to me in months and when I saw her she didn‚Äôt really talk to me to be honest we didn‚Äôt even speak. We were so close I thought she loved me too thought she‚Äôd have my back through all this and yet she hasn‚Äôt rang me once to see how I am. Then I thought hmm what about Nanna? Well she seems to always have an excuse to not see me and yet can go to ghislaine if she has a cold, she didn‚Äôt even check on me when I was going to kill myself. But there‚Äôs one person I know for a fact truly loves me. My grandad, he is the most caring man I know he tries his best with everyone even though I‚Äôm not his favourite, at least I have him. But I try looking for good stuff but it‚Äôs so hard, what about your friends? I think. Oh yeah... they all pretty much left you. At least you have jack! I do yeah that‚Äôs no doubt. Family?! Uhh sure some if they don‚Äôt already hate me sure. I dont know why I‚Äôm typing all this even if someone found it I doubt they‚Äôd read it, maybe I‚Äôve already killed myself and you found this. Well hello who ever found this! Uhh have a nice day? 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 
Back to the jacks father crying, when I told people how I felt they made it feel more like I was being a burden by saying it. Not one, now listen right not one person out of many I know, came up to me and has just said are you okay? You know I care about you a lot and if you did anything I‚Äôd be devastated without you. That‚Äôs all I want from people but I apparently can‚Äôt even get that, so... shit there‚Äôs nothing for me here anymore I have no future no one who sees me as their special person. One real friend, most my family don‚Äôt really like me; a lot of people hate me. A lot of people have stopped talking to me and told me they hate me a lot of people have looked the other way from me. I see no other reason at this point. I know for a fact I will die by suicide that‚Äôs a fact, probably it will be when jack or grandad go away I‚Äôll go through with it think of me as a pussy if you want but I don‚Äôt care I‚Äôm done with everyone‚Äôs shit, teachers hate me for some reason, most parents dislike me. most people in my new school will hate me too since rumours are going around by a really popular kid who everyone likes, and think about it who are they gonna side with the random new kid, or the popular guy everyone likes, honestly right now the only good thing going on is me staying where I am. Once that‚Äôs over I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. I am just fucking done and will happily end my life when I get the chance. 

Well I‚Äôm here again! Things still suck, Jacob has listed a bunch of my flaws tonight; said I make his self esteem low, says he wants to kill me too! I asked and he only feels this way about me. I think he‚Äôs only friends with me because he‚Äôs scared I‚Äôm gonna kill myself if he leaves me too. I didn‚Äôt message or reply to anyone for the last 3 days didn‚Äôt matter though since no one messaged me anyway. You may think I‚Äôm extremely sad... but not really, like yeah I am but like I just really don‚Äôt care about anything anymore, I‚Äôve had so much shit happen that nothing really bothers me anymore I write all this simply because I need to put it somewhere. If I show this to someone I‚Äôll probably be put in a psychiatric facility, now that would be shit. I doubt I have a future since I‚Äôve missed out most my key learning. It‚Äôs a shame I might lose Jack though, once I‚Äôve lost him and grandad I‚Äôll probably end my free trial of living, I wonder how I‚Äôll do it though... I need to go out well so I am gonna try sort out things with my family and live a nice week with them all and try live a nice peaceful life for once, I just don‚Äôt know anymore; like really though if I do kill myself... how many people would miss me? Like long term not counting like a week, I mean like a whole month of grief. I genuinely can‚Äôt think, like maybe my grandad but he has other grandkids who are way better than me, but I can‚Äôt be bothered saying everyone since I will feel shit again. Thing is jack says all this stuff to me you know? ‚ÄúI wanna use a shotgun to kill you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI like the thought of beating you to death with a blunt object‚Äù like my only friend says he wants to beat me to death, maybe you‚Äôre thinking get better friends but... no one really wants to talk to me :/ 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 

Well I mean I just need to figure out how I kill my self hanging most likely I might end up getting some shit online though, once I have that I will sneak out find somewhere remote away from people and kill myself there, I am genuinely getting tingles thinking about ending my life it makes me feel genuinely happy. I‚Äôll be sure to go to the toilet as to not cause bowel movements since my corpse should have some decency. I don‚Äôt want a funeral though, if I end my life it‚Äôs cheating so I don‚Äôt deserve one. What‚Äôs a shame is people only seem to really care when you‚Äôre gone. I also am pretty curious about the after life, I mean it‚Äôs probably just black but it‚Äôs peaceful, heaven and hell probably aren‚Äôt real although a heaven sounds nice, eh whatever I‚Äôm off to sleep now. If you‚Äôre reading this I hope you‚Äôre someone who actually cares about me and not some random guy/girl.

I don‚Äôt want to, if that‚Äôs what I need to put up with to get a ‚Äúgood job‚Äù then fuck that because ya know what I will almost definitely die by suicide so it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway; I just wanna enjoy what I have man, guess I can‚Äôt even have that.

I think most important one was to find love, someone that i would care for more than anything, who would also care for me very much - that kind of love. Its like a child talking, I know, but I had this dream from my early childhood. I think after seeing some romantic movie, or something like that. And of course having a family, decent job so i wouldnt struggle as much as my parents. 

After having a girlfriend I am maybe even scared to try again. Seeing what a crappy bf I was. I know, its something I can work on, but that experience. That two people can hurt each other so much, mostly just with words. What can a person say to another one  in anger. I always thought especially during fighting about nice moments we had and why I loved her.But I dont think she did. She started to take those moments and twist them. all of them. I couldnt believe she lied about so much stuff. In the end I dont even know if she ever loved me at all. That she maybe also lied about it too. Now even if I meet someone, that is the first thing to cross my mind. And I dont want it to repeat again. And women arent even interested in me. I know. why would they be? i wouldnt. 

Other dreams are like that too. Gone. I feel empty about them. I just finished uni. barely. Now I have to go to find a work.  But how should I even exist if  I am anxious to leave my own room. I feel safe here. I spent almost my whole life here. Studying, sleeping, playing games, watching movies, reading books. Staying here when dad was drunk. Staying here when mom is drunk. And praying that they will let me be.

I dont like having lots of people around me. I feel like I need to go away after few minutes. And I dont drink. I hate alcohol, and I always got angry at people who drunk in front of me.  I just recently only few years back got kinda over it. But still I am not a big fan of it.

It has just become frustrating to me that just because I'm indian no one wants to talk to me as if i did something wrong well most of the chats with any girl ended with getting blocked or ignored and no i didn't ask for nudes or say anything bad i guess people from my country have done some bad shit online ffs man one job they had one job and they fucked it up.

I made two posts,becouse one wasn't enough to full expres myself.

And you guys helped me!

In a way of agreeing that I'll probably be homeless in the future.

(And living in giant-ass dashboard box is best I'll do)

Telling me that living doesn't have any sense,and I should just accept that I'm a bitch in a void of nothingness.

(With another guy agreeing with him).

Fact that I most likely were a mistake.

&lt;My mom got pregnant by accident&gt;.

Giving me life advice,and openly telling me that you are too lazy to do it,and never tried.

And fact that I should have killed myself long time ago.

Ending our convo with basicalt shit like ""good luck,cya"".

To all my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù: 

Oh you need me to stand by you on your wedding day, amongst a sea of your friends that I don‚Äôt know? Sure i‚Äôll be there, with a nice gift of course. Because I was your ‚Äúfirst best friend‚Äù but you forgot about me for the past 20 years. 

Oh its your daughter‚Äôs birthday party tomorrow? Sure i‚Äôll come with a nice gift because I care about her. You wouldn‚Äôt do the same for my kids, but I look past that. My family will probably get her something too because our families are that close. We will spend $100 or more on her altogether. We might get a thank you. But probably not. 

Oh I‚Äôm having a small christmas get together and the kids can write Santa letters. They will get a response back from the North Pole! Your there for once and write letters not only for your young children but for 10 others as well. You called them and told them about it so of course i‚Äôll spend the time and money to crank out those extra personalized letters. wouldn‚Äôt want them to think Santa forgot. 

Oh your now doing the same program in college that I just finished and you need notes? Poor you, you just dont have the time to do them on your own. Sure, here they all are. Lets not talk about how it took me 1-2 hours per page, and you just got over 100 pages of notes. For free. I had to give up things to find the time, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to do that too. 

Oh I‚Äôm having a Christmas paint party, and I would love for all of my friends to come. You know the people I spend all year doing for. You all say sure, we would Love to come. Days of dragging out decorations, money spent on food and painting supplies. And nobody. You say your sick or forgot about this or that. 

Oh you bought a new house? Heres a housewarming gift. You graduated college? Heres something for you to enjoy. Merry Christmas! It‚Äôs not much, but Iove you! Happy Birthday! I know i‚Äôm not going to get anything in return, but that‚Äôs not why I do it. I want you to feel acknowledged. 

Happy Birthday to me? Thats a joke. Did you even acknowledge it? Because I know your not going to show up. 

Oh you said Don‚Äôt let someone in if your not willing to be friends with her. Don‚Äôt make her be alone in a group of 60+ women. But what did you do to me? Did you think you could be my friend and then I turned out to be that bad? Or someone else was gonna be my friend, right? Just not you. 

You want me to join your soap box, use my voice in the organization we are now alums for. Where were you when I needed a voice? When I couldnt find mine and was bullied in our organization? 

Oh you want to know if i‚Äôm a nurse because you just took some medications and are scared they are gonna react? Call poison control. You won‚Äôt even tell me the amount or names of what you took. Just allergy and depression meds. You accused me of not caring if you die. 

Oh you need $900 to finish paying for your classes? You promised you would pay me back the next month when you had the money. Its been 6 months and I haven‚Äôt seen a penny. And you dropped those same classes 3 weeks later. Atleast its not your money you wasted. 

Oh you want sex? But thats the only time you want to see me. Other things are more important when we would have time to actually see each other. 2 am is more your style. when theres time for nothing else, just for you to finish and leave. 

Oh you said I don‚Äôt know what its like to not have money for food at the end of the month. A&amp;B didn‚Äôt eat for a month one time so they could feed their kids. You say I wouldnt do that. Do you think i‚Äôm a cold hearted bitch? I‚Äôve never had to do that but I would do it in a heart beat. 

Oh you said I never had to steal bread and milk as a child to have something to eat. But it‚Äôs not my fault. You said I am just not aware of what I have. Meanwhile, I have breakdowns because I feel like I don‚Äôt I deserve what I do have. I‚Äôm painfully aware. Are you punishing me because my childhood was better than yours? 

Oh You say I don‚Äôt hold myself to the same standards as I do you. 2 bachelors degrees, halfway thru a masters degree at 24. Payed for most of my college thru academic and D2 athletic scholarships. But your right, those standards aren‚Äôt high enough. 

You wonder why i‚Äôm upset. You wonder why i‚Äôm tired. Its because there is no break. Theres no person to turn too. Its always me helping you, doing for you. But where are you when i‚Äôm falling apart? You never invite me unless its a situation i‚Äôm expected to bring a gift, because you know i will. You never hesitate to call me when you need me. I tried texting you a few times and seeing if we could talk because i needed someone to talk to. But no response or you would get back to me later. My birthday is in 2 weeks. Its one of the most depressing days of my life, but now its not as bad as it used to be because I no longer expect anyone to remember or care. My facebook sends me notifications of friends birthdays each day. I tell myself you turned that off and aren‚Äôt just ignoring me. Even though you probably are.

780,n_j_g,1592835150,2,"Not sure if anyone will see this. Been thinking about this the last few months and need to get it out.

I was always pretty introverted when I was younger. I always struggled to make friends, and when I did, they always left (moving to a new city/ county).  I think this stems from the pain I experienced in my younger years. I felt like an outsider living life on the sidelines of other people‚Äôs worlds. I developed unhealthy coping mechanisms in lieu of this, over eating, video game addiction ect as an escape from the difficultly of the real world. In the early years of high school I had a groups of friend I played Call of Duty with. And although I‚Äôm pretty sure it was out of pity they felt for me it was nice to have a group of friends I could call my own. Unfortunately after some time they moved on without me, they were good looking, popular and well known. All of which I wasn‚Äôt. There were quite a few years after that where I kept to myself and I was at peace with it. By that point I was well over 100kg and only played video games. It was so ways because it numbed the pain. 

In 2018 I was fortunate enough to have a life altering experience which set me on the right path. And this was in my second last year of high school. In the following year I lost 45kg and gained a lot of confidence in how I looked and felt. I was, for the first time in 5 years, happy. I was ok too of the world. It didn‚Äôt matter to me that I didn‚Äôt have friends, I was able to move past it. 

In the following year I spent a lot more time with other people and became a lot more extroverted, going to parties and talking to more people.

It became physically painful for me to be alone. I became so fearful of missing out on things. 

Now with the lockdown because of corona virus, life had been the most difficult it has ever been. Which makes me feel awful because I know I have it better than so many other people. 

I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going and I‚Äôm really tired so I‚Äôll wrap it up here: I want more than anything to have a group of friends that reach out to me. Ask if I want to join them to go fishing, or play games online, or get food, or go for a drive. Anything. But nope. I want more than anything to have an intimate relationship where someone cares for me. I can‚Äôt imagine what it feels like to have someone genuinely care about me. 

I feel like I‚Äôm  the only person who feels like this, and I know I‚Äôm not. 

Thanks for reading. I hope I don‚Äôt come off as selfish or narcissistic or ignorant. I‚Äôm just hurting and need some help.

Any advice would be very much appreciated.

790,JackDorsy99,1592823494,1,"Right now I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Not just in general of course with everyday life, but specifically right now as I‚Äôm writing whatever the hell this is or is gonna be. I heard that writing about what you‚Äôre feeling, what you‚Äôre thoughts are, and what you‚Äôre experiencing helps to cope with those very same feelings.

I‚Äôm pathetic, alone, sad, with virtually no friends, and no one to share my feelings with. Part of me always knew that being isolated and alone is bad and unhealthy, because it‚Äôs even scientifically proven that loneliness is even worse than smoking. However, when you‚Äôre smoking, you‚Äôre active and you‚Äôre doing something to make you unhealthy, with loneliness, you‚Äôre inactive and you‚Äôre not doing something, which is socializing. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but putting a stop to a certain activity/habit is easier than to have to start something new.

Anyway, the sadness that I‚Äôm feeling at this very moment is most likely due to me realizing that (again), but what initiated that realization was something that I didn‚Äôt know it would make me react like this.

I watched basically the whole trial of ‚ÄúNevada vs. War-Machine‚Äù yesterday, and by the end of it I felt similarly to how I feel now, like someone‚Äôs punching me in the stomach over, and over again, and there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop it, except to try and distract myself with something and not think.

Watching Christy Mack talk about what she went through on the stand, and reading about it, honestly broke me emotionally completely. And of course, I think most people can relate to that, but for me I think it me really hard because of how I think I‚Äôm at least partly responsible for the sick and twisted thought-process that most people have about porn-stars, more particularly female porn-stars. It‚Äôs not that I wished ill-will on any of them, but I always seemed to degrade them, and think that they‚Äôre people without any dignity or shame, because they perform sex-acts in front of a camera for money. I would always use their profession against them whenever I saw them talking about serious issues.

Seeing the pictures of her beaten, cut, and scared, humanized porn-stars for me. But here‚Äôs where I started feeling like sh\*t, when I realized that I‚Äôm such a scumbag, that I needed to see a woman testify in court about her abusive relationship, and seeing the pictures of her after her assault, that that‚Äôs what I needed in order for me to look at porn-stars as human f\*cking beings.

Then, me realizing that I can‚Äôt really share any of these feelings with someone, because firstly like I said I basically have no friends, and the one person and ‚Äòfriend‚Äô that I know is a neighbor 2 years younger than me, with whom I can‚Äôt really talk about almost anything because honestly, he‚Äôs not that bright, or that empathetic. And another ‚Äòfriend‚Äô whom I talk to almost every day on facebook, took a giant sh\*t on my feelings the second I opened up to him. It was when a classmate from middle-school died, I was feeling very depressed, even though I didn‚Äôt even know her that well and hadn‚Äôt seen her in years, but I was actually planning on contacting her once I got back from college for the summer in my hometown, only to find out through and old friend that she died, and that she died only a couple of months ago when I came back. So when I told my friend this, and asked him to leave me alone and not write or contact me for a while because I wanna be alone for the time being, and he just continued bugging me, and telling me how a bunch of friend of his have died and that it is what it is, and telling me to get the f\*ck over it.

So, when my experience with ‚Äòfriends‚Äô is like this, I kinda lose hope about ever kinda ‚Äòcuring‚Äô myself if you will, from loneliness, because even if I make new friends, or get reacquainted with old ones once again, I know that I‚Äôll never be able to open-up to them about some emotional issues, knowing the fact that I‚Äôm only handing them ammunition for them to use on me if we ever have a falling out, or just in an argument.

As I‚Äôm writing this by the way, I was crying my eyes off, then I felt better, then I started feeling sad again. It‚Äôs not that this is the first time I ever felt like this, but it never gets easier, it always feels like this is gonna be time that‚Äôll last forever, or that it‚Äôll be a lot more serious. And it would be understandable for people to react this way, to be depressed if something in their life happened that was a big change, but for me, nothing has seriously change, everything‚Äôs the same, the only time I feel like this, is when reality hits me in the face, and that reality is that I‚Äôm alone, and I‚Äôm alone with my feelings, having no one to share them with except with people that either don‚Äôt care, or will just use the information that I shared with them as a tool to use me in the future or to just torment me.

And the most f\*cked up part about this, I really have no god d\*mn right to be bitching and moaning like this, I have two loving parents since I was a kid, they work really hard and make enough money, not much but enough for me to have a great room, great clothes, a pc that allows me to play almost all my favorite games, food, everything. They gave me the freedom to choose where I wanted to go in high-school, and then after that where I wanted to go in college, they pay for it, thankfully I‚Äôm doing very well at college right now. So, for me to feel depressed, is almost insulting in a way towards people that don‚Äôt have even half of what I have, and this isn‚Äôt me bragging, because I didn‚Äôt deserve most of the things that I got in my life, it‚Äôs just me thinking about how selfish I am that I feel bad for not having friends or whatever, while there are people in my country even that don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll have enough money for food tomorrow in order for them to not put their kids in bed hungry.

I mentioned that I have two parents, my dad and I aren‚Äôt too close and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll understand what I‚Äôm saying even if I did try and open-up to him about my emotions. My mother on the other hand I‚Äôm very comfortable around, and we talk about a lot of things, and is really the person that I spend the most time with. But there in-lies the issue, I know, even if she doesn‚Äôt say it, that her seeing me like this sometimes is not easy for her, and that I‚Äôm bothering her with stupid sh\*t, when I should be hanging out with my friends. This is the part that disturbs me the most about myself, whenever I see on youtube a news clip about a shooting, or even a terrorist attack, or videos about serial-killers etc. most of the perpetrators of these crimes are loners with no friends, no girlfriend, shy, introverted, and often times live at home with their mother. I‚Äôd be lying if I said that that doesn‚Äôt scare me to death. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôd ever do something like that, but just the fact that I have a lot of characteristics with these lowest of the low, scares me. Another thing is with the incels, and ‚Äònice-guys‚Äô. I‚Äôm a virgin still, even though I‚Äôm in my early twenties, but no only that, I have never, ever had a girlfriend, and I‚Äôve never even kissed a girl. That‚Äôs another red-flag that unnerves me, because it‚Äôs not like I still don‚Äôt have those bitter feelings, when seeing girls that I like, go out with ‚Äòjerks‚Äô and ‚Äòdouchebags‚Äô instead of going out with me (even though I was always too chicken-sh\*t to even approach and ask them out in the first place). It‚Äôs kinda like getting angry that you didn‚Äôt win at a lottery, even though you didn‚Äôt even buy a ticket. But unfortunately, no matter how illogical and unreasonable my thoughts are about that, I‚Äôm still emotionally and sexually frustrated because of that, and I‚Äôm still bitter. Although I think the main thing about this that‚Äôs the most irritating, is that I don‚Äôt know if I ever even ‚Äòreally‚Äô wanted a girlfriend, because when I think about why I‚Äôm I ‚Äòwant‚Äô a girlfriend, the first thing that pops into my head is because I don‚Äôt wanna be looked at as a weirdo or an outcast, and not because I love the person that‚Äôs my girlfriend. So it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm a spy, that needs to fit-in and not look suspicious, and that‚Äôs the main reason why I‚Äôm seeking a relationship, which is really cynical.

Interestingly enough, virgins and ‚Äòlosers‚Äô like myself, and promiscuous women, can, and are natural allies against the irrational stigmas that most societies have about ‚Äòlosers‚Äô and ‚Äòwhores‚Äô. Bough of these groups are judged by the ‚Äòmoderates‚Äô who point out about how we‚Äôre not ‚Äònormal‚Äô. Virgin men are too weird and unsettling for moderates, and at the same time, promiscuous women are too un-dignifying for them. All because of how bough groups choose (or in the case of many virgins, don‚Äôt chooser) how to live their private-life.

But, on the other hand, a lot of these same people from these groups also don‚Äôt get along with each other very well. Virgins and ‚Äònice-guys‚Äô love to sh\*t on women that are just living life to the fullest, and doing what they want with their body, but just because they‚Äôre not doing those things with them, they get frustrated and vent their anger and insecurities towards these women. And some women who are promiscuous, see virgin men as either ‚Äòboring‚Äô, or creepy, or just think that they‚Äôre ‚Äòtoo nice‚Äô. Now obviously, the incels and the ‚Äònice-guys‚Äô are much, much more dangerous and toxic, than the women that belittle some men for being ‚Äòtoo nice‚Äô, it‚Äôs not even close.

Like I said, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever thought that female porn-stars are ‚Äòless‚Äô than human, but I definitely had some prejudices against them. Ever since yesterday, and after watching Christy Mack in court, I‚Äôve 100% changed my opinion about it. Being a porn-star IS a job, and people are flat-out wrong when they judge porn-stars and sex-workers because of the work that they do.

I‚Äôm a socialist, but even with the hatred that I have towards the stock-brokers and thieves on Wallstreet, I always thought ‚ÄúWell hey, at least they‚Äôre doing what they‚Äôre doing with some dignity‚Äù in order for me to somehow do mental-gymnastics and rationalize my prejudice against female porn-stars. This also reminds me of a scene from the movie ‚ÄòThe people vs. Larry Flint‚Äô, where Larry gives a presentation and a speech about the government‚Äôs attack on his freedom of speech, and in the end of the scene he asks the audience ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs more offensive? Sex, or War?‚Äù. It‚Äôs really barbaric and backwards, that we congratulate and even thank people for their ‚Äòservice‚Äô for them murdering people, but at the same time judge, ridicule, and dehumanize sex-workers like their pieces of garbage and sub-human.

I kinda feel better now after writing this, and whenever I try to give or find an explanation about why I‚Äôm feeling the way I‚Äôm feeling, it always kinda helps me to feel better because I know emotions are just a biological thing, there‚Äôs nothing magical or spiritual about it really, it‚Äôs just your brain and body reacting to certain things around you. It‚Äôs kinda like natures way of programming you with a ‚Äòcarrot‚Äô and a ‚Äòstick‚Äô. Being happy is nature‚Äôs and evolution‚Äôs way of rewarding you for doing ‚Äògood‚Äô things, and vice-versa.

I‚Äôd like to end by saying that I know this horrific feeling inside me won‚Äôt last forever, but I also know that it‚Äôll come back, sooner or later. This is the first time I actually had the energy to start writing about it, and I don‚Äôt know if it helped, maybe it helped because I was distracted and more focused on writing that to just thinking and being alone with only my thoughts, but I don‚Äôt know. But I‚Äôll probably write again, even if I feel better. I just have no idea why I feel so emotionally attached towards this specific person, Christy Mack, I just can‚Äôt get over how much I feel for her, I actually spent like over 2-3 hours if not longer, trying to find any information about how she‚Äôs doing today, I followed her on every social-media platform I could find, just to see how she‚Äôs doing. And even after seeing that she has posted a video on her onlyfans account, about how she‚Äôs gonna be celebrating her friend‚Äôs birthday, and I saw that she actually has been shooting amateur porn videos on her onlyfans account for a year or two I think, so she‚Äôs clearly fine, but god d\*mn do I feel like sh\*t still. It might be because of the fact that I know that there‚Äôs sick some pieces of sh\*ts out there that are even worse than I was, that they defend that brain-dead neanderthal rapist War Machine, and say that she ‚Äògot what she deserved‚Äô. And to think that I‚Äôve probably contributed at least a little towards that kind of slut-shaming and degrading of another human being for just living their life, kills me inside.

Anyway, I‚Äôve already wrote way too much, I only thought to write this for myself and to look back on, but again, I guess I‚Äôm not a ‚ÄòGod‚Äô, I‚Äôm a human and a social-animal, that needs at least some kind of contact with other members of my own species in order for me to survive and live a healthy life, even if that contact is virtual or even non-existent, just the fact that I know that someone might have similar feelings as me, and makes me NOT feel alone, is kinda enough to make the loneliness, maybe not disappear completely of course, but make it a lot more bearable, because it IS a pain, no matter how much I‚Äôve tried to convince myself that even though I‚Äôm alone, I‚Äôm not actually LONELY. But I am, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna change to much, I just want it to change a little bit, in order for me to deal with it.

And even though most likely nobody‚Äôs gonna read even the first sentence this, I still gotta say thank you if you did do that.",lonely,"Feeling lonely, sad, and contemplating my stance on pornstars, my hatred towards incels, my fear of the common characteristics I have with lowest of the low, not being able to share my feelings with friends, of which I have almost none.

813,rrebu,1592798998,1,"I don‚Äôt really have any place to vent right now so... yeah. 

Sorry if some of this is unintelligible. My mind‚Äôs all over the place at the moment. 

I‚Äôve only had one real friend for the past couple of years. She‚Äôs really great, but we haven‚Äôt talked in over a month. I know that‚Äôs partly my fault, but whenever I consider sending a message I just think ‚Äúnobody cares‚Äù and don‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt know how to make that go away. 

I have amazing friends I‚Äôve met online. But it feels like we‚Äôre kind of drifting away... Everything I say feels so awkward and every conversation I have just seems so forced and empty. Maybe because it‚Äôs been too long since I‚Äôve spoken with anyone besides my family...

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. I know that I shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to be in a relationship at this age, but I just feel so empty. Everyone in my family has someone. 

Someone to talk to. 

Someone to share their troubles with. 

Someone to care for them. 

Someone to /feel/ something with. 

I have nothing. 

This is really quite stupid, but a while ago my friend was teasing me about my (minor? probably not) infatuation with a celebrity. And she started talking about the ‚Äúwhens‚Äù

When I meet him. 

When we‚Äôre together. 

When we‚Äôre married???

And I know she didn‚Äôt mean much by it. And it isn‚Äôt her fault it happened. But ever since then I‚Äôve just had this twisting feeling in that keeps telling me how foolish I am and how ridiculous it is and just how... how... just how dumb am I to even consider the very possibility of anything ever happening? It‚Äôs such a cliche teenager thing and I hate it. I hate it so much. But it makes my heart ache so much and I don‚Äôt know if it will ever stop. 

I keep telling myself that I‚Äôve accepted my fate of being by myself forever. Hoping that I listen. But I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt be there for myself when I need it the most. People need one another to thrive, right? Or so I‚Äôve read... 
I just keep putting myself down and I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe to convince myself that I‚Äôm not worthy of anyone‚Äôs love? I‚Äôm not really sure anymore. I don‚Äôt know why I keep this thought in the back of my head. This thought that, maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôll find someone that really cares about me. But how is that supposed to happen when I don‚Äôt know how to talk to people? I‚Äôve tried to get better, I really have, but it just doesn‚Äôt work. And now I‚Äôm going to be starting my last year of high school. I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúthis is your last chance to find someone, otherwise you‚Äôll die alone.‚Äù And I know that isn‚Äôt true. I know that, if I can just stay alive through then, then my real life can start. But I also don‚Äôt believe that. And I don‚Äôt know how to get the bad thoughts out of my head.

If you read my other r/lonely post you'll get some back story. he's an update, still lonely, aren't we all, but I have made a new friend. a female friend. 

This is where I want the punch to the fucking face. I've talked to myself, I do it a lot, and I cant seem to lose it.   

Recap... 

I have a wife and son, haven't seen them since mid march. They are in Japan. I developed, Recently mind you, in the last few weeks, a friendship with a female coworker. Initially it was her confiding in me her own issues, I tend to be the ""peer councilor"" of sorts where I work. We became very chatty. Up front, I have had the worst 3 now 4 months of my life. I miss my wife, I miss my son, I changed my ENTIRE life to be a better husband and father. Why you ask, because it is required. to be a good man, change is required and I have done it. Now they are gone, and quite honestly "" I dont know what to do with my hands"". I bake, I cook, I clean my house until 3 in the morn like a meth head. I try so hard to preoccupy my time, I hike and run and fix my garden and build a pull up bar, I take college courses. I keep myself away form the loneliness.   

However.... 

Then I develop this friendship with this gal coworker, and I see the struggle. She is a gorgeous woman. funny, aggressive. Things that my wife isn't. I will be straight, my wife is a plain Jane Japanese gal, me a fucking Edward James Almos looking idiot. I see the cracks start to take form. I fight it. I feel myself losing.   she talks with me about her relationship, I loss my cool with what she tells me about her man, really because he is doing the same shit I did when I was early in my marriage, boils down to not being a fucking man. video games, porn and the like.   

I tell her that. because of some shared history in our workplace, some men are not cut out to be men. she tells me I am one of the strongest folks she has meet, The crack deepens, I believe it. I give her some mutual words.   

flash forward a few weeks, I'm at work, she isn't, She hits me up, her BF breaks up with her. I lose my cool, tell her the guys weak, and personally, I didn't say this to her, why the eff would he break up with such a pretty gal. It blew my fucking mind. Shes in a bad place, I recognize I'm not the dude to deal with this, I pass it to a female coworker. she goes out with her.  

 The next week, I want to express my sorrow to her, I go to her and tell her that I'm sorry that I got uppity about her ex BF, and I dont see why some men are weak, Here comes the hypocrisy, about LD relationships. 

  I offer to cook her dinner. this isn't unheard of from me. Quite honestly I love throwing dinner parties. I truly do. But this is different. Its just her. and then I realize, Bet you saw this coming, I'm attracted to her.   

I confide in a female boss and say, ""hey so in so, I offered to cook her dinner, you think it weird?"" she was like"" hey MF what your WIFE THINK!!!!!?"" great question I should figure out if my MARRIED FUCKING WIFE is cool with having a lady in our house.  

 I ask her, hey I want to cook dinner for a coworker gal from work. I respect you and love you, I want to know if its cool with you. She said, ""do what you want, just tell me before I come back to the states if you want divorce, I dont want to spend to much money coming back to japan. ""

   1) what a kind of rude answer, 2) ummmm okay,eh noted.   I 

DON'T WANT TO DO THIS!!!! 

But I do it anyways

 I say okay I'm going to do this.

   My mind screams with DON'T FUCKING DO THIS. DON'T PLAY WITH FIRE. but then I think, I'm looking at this in such a single fucking frame of reference. it takes 2 to tango baby. 

WHAT IF SHE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ME?!!!?? WHICH IS MOST LIKELY LIKE 99 TRUE!!!???!

 I realize I'm and just making up scenarios in my head. 

I want to cook for this coworker because I care for her. but I cant shake thinking more about her. 

  I am disgusted with myself. How dare I think that the Marriage that I have cultivated with a woman whom I am suppose to love and with a son we have made together, think that it is acceptable to think so deeply and fully with a gal that, what, meet maybe a month and a half ago, where you really had deep convos? 

I know in my heart, what I am doing, by cooking for this gal, and talking to her, with the simple text messages, (nothing ever sexual, just friendly) to me, I want it to be more, BUT ITS WRONG, if my wife sees these things, it would cause her concern. right, that means its wrong, right?  

YES, ITS WRONG.

But in my heart, truly in my heart, I want to love this coworker. I mean, not just sexual, I want to just be there, and cook for her, and lover her, and , well, and serve her. 

 I know it can never be. 

I am drawing too many assumptions, I know it's just because I'm lonely. 

Which is wrong to put on to her, this coworker. I am not thinking of her life and feelings,

Which is a wrong thing to do. 

I am a weak and cowardly man. 

  There is more to this, but it wont make a different any other way.     
  

I guess what I'm really scared about is losing a possible friend.  I just so deeply want to talk to someone on a real level. 

Which disgusts me the most.  

I cant suck it up for another month or 2 ? 

there are tougher men out there doing worse.  

and I make fabrications in my head of about loving another gal?

I am weak aren't I?",lonely,I'm slipping some more,2020-06-22 13:04:29

822,jacobdotjpeg,1592794299,1,"This is more of a story, so if you take the time to read ty :) No TLDR

For context I'm turning 17 in 2 months, and a rising senior. I may be na√Øve with emotions still but the last genuine relationship I had a compatible partner with was my freshman year. (Yes I understand some people have never been in one and I sympathize for you) I recently broke up with my gf a month ago because of quarantine. She had been my first girlfriend since the aforementioned and I really liked her. I can't say the same now because we broke up due to long distance and had more of that best friend romance rather than s/o feel because of how new the relationship was. (Literally started dating 3 days before we got sent home from school(I go to a boarding school)) . I think having this happen to me only made me miss being in an intimate relationship more and I've only subsidized feelings lonely with talking to girls on Snapchat who live hundreds of miles away smh, and that's out of my norm. And for the girl I broke up with we don't talk anymore, not surprisingly because I would normally have to start the conversations because she is the literal definition of what it means to work too much for what you want. And now I'm in a weird space because I find girls who are indecisive and lack common sense repulsive, but girls who are overbearing and always put themselves first disgusting but that's a typical teenager. I just want someone to cuddle with and spend time with, someone who would put thought into a conversation and my interests while trying to better a personal connection because it means something to them. And someone who would actually try to be on the same intellectual level as me and fight back rather than sit there and get offended when you pick on them. Obviously this is too much to ask for especially with quarantine.",lonely,First post ever about being lonely lol,2020-06-22 12:51:39
823,Anonymustardboy,1592793881,1,"When it comes to girls, i'm an average guy level attractive. I'm not busted ugly, yet i'm not a ken doll.

For awhile now I've been single by choice. Long story short, I've been through so many ups and downs thanks to toxic relationships. Every time I try to improve my quality of life. It falls apart around the feet of whatever relationship i'm in. Going through these things time and time again just kind of messed me up. Its more than the depression and loneliness. Its the feeling of abandonment. Its the feeling that everything that happened meant nothing. All the time you spent fixing yourself and for what? To throw it all away because of love? 

After my last big relationship I was in a state of hopelessness. I spent so much time trying to repair this relationship that never stood a chance. I was trying to live a better life as she was living a worse one. Coming from such a lifestyle, I understood, but fought for her. We went through it all together. Nd the amount of energy it took to keep this all afloat did anything but leave me riding through the storm alone. While I was easily replaced. 

I don't really want to go into grave detail cause I already have before. But I was suicidal after her. Not because of HER but because it revealed to me how everything is a lie. Love is a lie. There's no meaning to life foreal. I mean besides working and going home, rinse repeat. It made me despise love. Fear took control of me that night. The fear of not knowing how much more I could take of this. The fear of losing myself and doing something stupid. I dont want to die. At the same time, I dont see much of a point to living. So I just stay high... 

Nd its been like that for some time. Nd as much as I want to change, I just cant. I have like a relationship PTSD where i'm an asshole before anything even happens. As soon as things get more intimate than friends. I feel vulnerable. I feel like I gotta hide my weaknesses and I gotta put on a fake face and attitude. I push people away without really meaning to. Nd ive tried to talk to people bout it first. Like yo Im a little messed up and relationships scare me, but that will also fuck things up before they ever start so there's no right answer other than FAKE IT. 

So I just stay away from it. I literally just had a opportunity last Friday to go drink with a couple cute chicks and stay the night, but I told em to make other plans the day before because I feel like im not in the right condition rn to be meeting with people, even if its nothing but sex. I want to look good, smell good, feel good all that. Nd dealing with depression I just dont have those attribues all the time. Nd Nobody wants to be around someone whos depressed when all they wanna do is have fun. 

But i did miss out on a possible threesome and all that so i mean.... Idk I want to smack myself at the same time I know why I cancelled. Nd I still feel like it was the right move. Coulda saved myself a humiliating night of showing up, not being good enough and then them getting someone else to come down instead.

When I was 6 years old I was molested a few times by someone that lived in my own house. I forgot about it all these years because it was so traumatic I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was a child, I was just a child. It makes me feel disgusting and sick when I think about it. I was a broken child, and my parents never knew why. Anyways now that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it I was thinking I should probably go see a therapist. I‚Äôm in two minds because I don‚Äôt want to talk about it and open up about all the details because it‚Äôll mentally kill me, however I‚Äôm smart enough to know I need to do this for myself and in the long run I will thank myself.

I had this emotionally abusive ex who was my junior in college, she was so toxic and used me so much for money, educational needs etc that while I was teaching her how to ace her exams I flunked my own, lost weight in order to buy her food neglecting my own, I went into deep depression and she pushed it further to the point where I jumped off the roof of my house and broke my hand in 3 places.
She told me ""you cannot be of any use to me depressed, id rather have you as a friend cause I cannot handle you as my boyfriend..you don't have anything provide being depressed"" 
And while we were in this wierd limbo phase of talking/not talking she went ahead and got into a relationship with another guy.

She still texts me and asks for support/help and consoling whenever required(especially if she fights with her bf)....and I do it without complaining...(her texts with me are a national secret which her parents,bf and even her best friends don't know because they will judge her)

Now comes the problem, the very few times i try and talk about my problems with her I get ignored/ dismissed (I didn't expect anything else) and it hurts..

I want to cut off communication with her permanently, but she is the only person who talks to me(even though it's for her own purposes).

To be clear I DO NOT have any feelings for her anymore, when I jumped off the roof, my feelings jumped along with me.

Help me guys what do I do? I don't have friends to talk/text me apart from her.

TLDR: I cannot block my emotionally abusive ex because she is the only person who still talks to me (either for consoling her or asking for help)

I am also a very honest, upfront, say it like it is person. I dropped 3 lines expressing how I feel out of the loop and not reached out too or involved. All 3 advances to speak about the elephant in the room and they ignored it and pretended like I didn‚Äôt speak.. 

I‚Äôm genuinely hurt by all of this.. I have always jumped through hoops for my friends. Making sure they were okay and trying to make plans and making them feel important even when I was 3 provinces away..

I don‚Äôt know what to do.. I feel alone, depressed.. but feel like speaking up is pointless since they don‚Äôt even care to hear how my life is since moving back. Being 30 and feeling like a reject when you did nothing tends to eat at you non stop. 

What do you think I should do? What would you do in these circumstances? Especially with people who know you are a sensitive person. 

I would appreciate any advice given.",lonely,30 Years old and feel alone for the first time in life,2020-06-22 01:38:22

My current boyfriend is out all the time with his friends, and has social circles from his LGBT activism and it's hard to talk to him about something he does not understand, and it's hard on our relationship that I have to rely on him so much when I don't want to.

She usually avoids confrontations so maybe she is trying to ease her way out of our friendship. I feel absolutely ridiculous, I've done so many things this week and I had no one to share them, because there's only one person I want to tell them to.

And honestly I reckon I might like her more than she likes me, i feel betrayed because she also used to initiate conversations with me but now I don't exist for her anymore. It makes me wonder, was it always like that? She never truly cared for me?

I guess I'll have to focus on other things for now and not give my whole friendship to a particular person but instead I should give little bits to several people?

896,Foreignerinnihon,1592732365,1,"

as my username suggests, im an international student in japan. introverted. i do like talking to people but i dont really know many people (i do know quite a few people, but most arent people i'd talk and open up to). for me its not about having many friends, but its about having quality friends.

i arrived in April 2019, lived in a dorm, had a few friends. i moved to an apartment to live alone late July, and by the end of August, all of my friends have gone back to their home-countries. it was only in November that i started feeling isolated and lonely. it is something that fluctuates, for some periods im good, for some periods it makes me feel depressed - as i am writing this, i am at a lonely period, ive had difficulty focusing on my online lectures and completing other tasks. my gym has reopened and i thought id be extremely happy about it. i am, but not as happy as i thought id be.

ive had zero motivation at all this week and some uni stuff is piling up, its stressing me out.

having no one to talk to for a very long time, is surprisingly, only the minor cause of my loneliness. one of the main causes for me is lack of physical touch. id describe myself as an affectionate person. id hug and cuddle my friends, cook for them and etc...and not having someone to do that to is hard. not having someone do that to me is hard...though i dont really expect people to do that anyways.

i've lacked affection so much, back in jan my lab mate tugged my arm so i can move to the side and let the guy on the bicycle behind me pass through, and it was a strange yet positive feeling for me.

i'm so touch starved that even when the fingers of the cashier hands me my change and touches my hand, it feels good.

ive never heard the cashiers here say ""take care"" (in japanese) to other customers. i dont know if there was a look on my face, but on my bday (that i celebrated alone and took myself out to eat), i went to a convenience store  and got a ""take care"" for the cashier, and that was enough to put a smile on my face.

another source of loneliness is a bit difficult for me to explain. in probably all of my friendships, i play the big brother role: making sure everyone is ok, being there when needed and etc. i dont expect anything in return, but as of lately, i cant help but wonder what it feels like to be looked out for, to be cared about, to be considered...to be the little brother. aside from my parents, no one really checks up on me. I've been alone for slightly too long, i cant remember what it feels like to meet someone who makes me feel cared about.

I also realize that the lonelier i feel, the more I resort to using social media. I also realize i tend to watch more porn and masturbate more when Im feeling lonely (sorry for the info)

I miss my old self. I use to not use social media so much even though I had it downloaded on my phone. I miss my old self who was a badass who didn‚Äôt feel like he needed much attention from people. That person was productive and unstoppable. But now, Ive been seeking happiness that requires other people, and I don‚Äôt know what to think about it. All i want is someone to ask me if I‚Äôm doing ok, if I‚Äôve eaten, if i want to do something on the weekend, someone who thinks about me. I never knew loneliness could be this debilitating.

on the plus side of things, ive been taking a break from instagram (it was consuming my time) and it has allowed me to reconnect with myself. ive remembered some goals ive had but forgotten, ive been becoming a bit more mindful and enjoy-the-moment ish, ive started to enjoy hiking again. its not all that bad, but the lows can be.

904,RockinTheRedTie,1592724397,1,"I'm 21 and just graduated college. I studied a lot of things, but no field really stood out as my passion. I liked studying it all, creative writing and web design and music and entrepreneurship and filmmaking, it felt good bouncing around it all. But now I'm out and living with my family and staying in my room playing video games all day and I'm finding a dense depression inside me again, snuck up on me like a shadow.

I feel too awkward and shy to look into anybody's eyes for more than a couple seconds. I shake a bit when I'm standing in line anywhere, just around people, worse without my meds. Maybe it's about this quarantine, but even if everything opened up I don't know what I would do. My family is new to this state and I don't know a soul, all my old high school friends are across the country. I miss them a lot, I feel like I abandoned them, disappeared or ran away. Maybe they've forgotten about me.

I broke up with my gf after trying to go long distance for a month, she started getting upset at my jokes. We argued and fought more and more, and we found our interests in movies and music started clashing. Maybe it's because we couldn't be around each other, zoom wasn't close enough. The worst thing is that I don't miss her because it was the first truly healthy relationship I've been in. It was so healthy and good that I felt confident enough to leave, and she understood. It helped me discover what I want in a relationship, that trust and freedom, that lack of dependency but flood of joy and just wanting to be together. All my other exes made me feel incredibly self conscious and low but not her, she was really good. Now she's dating another guy who has the same name as me, funny how that happens like that.

I have no clue what to do with my life. My parents want me to find a job, anything, starting pay 30k but I hate working. Even in those fields I studied, I don't want to work and get paid and go home and work and get paid and laugh with a co worker and go home and live that life. I understand the appeal for others but for me, I hate routine. And plans, and structure. Especially in music and software creation, when it's industrialized like that it feels robotic, like an AI could do it. Like anybody could do it. I don't like that feeling, I want to do something only I can do, whatever it is. But I don't know what that is, I don't have a single clue.

Today I realized it's all just a massive hole inside me, something that eats me up. And I try to clog it with porn or twitter or tinder or league of legends, but it turns it all to ash. Like running on a treadmill, going nowhere fast. I feel guilty for feeling this way because my life isn't bad, I graduated college, I have a great family, I just ate a bucket of chicken from kfc a couple hours back, but I can't deny this hole anymore. It feels familiar, but it's never been like this. Never this frightening, like staring off a cliff.

It's like I got dropped into gta 6, a massive map, and there's a ton of side missions but nothing to point me in the right direction. It's all so overwhelming, and I'm wondering why I bought this game at all? Why was I excited for this? Why did I want this so much, this peace in nothingness, this freedom in everything, this black hole in my home?

I‚Äôll start with the basics. I‚Äôm a 16 year old girl and I‚Äôm from the USA (Illinois to be exact). Some of my hobbies include playing guitar/other instruments,singing,filming/editing,art (drawing and water color painting),watching tv and YouTube,meeting others (kinda weird since I‚Äôm very shy and don‚Äôt really have any friends at the moment but yup lol),learning French,etc. My favorite tv show atm is HunterxHunter and I‚Äôm not too far into the show so if you have watched the whole thing I may not have watched most of it lol. I‚Äôm shy irl, but I will help in any way I can. I am open to having any type of conversation. My favorite type though is more deep conversations though. I‚Äôm in the process of writing a song atm because I want to be a musician. That‚Äôs all I will say :)

So that‚Äôs it!I wanted to make this post mostly to have you guys comment a paragraph or something about you!People can read the comments below and see if there is anyone like them to message.

Throughout most of my life I‚Äôve only been comfortable talking and being around my mom, dad, sister and therapist that I see. I only had one friend early on in my life from kindergarten (2005) to about 6th grade (2011) when we drifted off. From then on to today i've been alone because i'm very anxious/nervous around people and do not feel accepted or comfortable around people due to my mental disorder.(ill get to that soon)

I was a very quiet person when I was younger. My parents and teachers were concerned with me since I never talked in school. I would only talk in front of my parents, sister and friend. I wouldn‚Äôt even talk in front of other family members such as my cousins, aunt and grandparents. For some reason letting other people hear my voice felt very scary. I did not understand I had a problem. I was happy with my only friend and viewed not talking as normal.Obviously it was not normal and something was going on. Looking back on it now I was very scared, uncomfortable and anxious around people/strangers but it became normal and felt normal to me when I was very young. 

In elementary school I wouldn‚Äôt talk and did not like talking in front of students. When I say that I mean I would not say a word at school. I was known by students for being quiet and not talking. I was mute for everyone everyday until the last year or so of elementary when I got more comfortable responding to questions my teachers had. By middle school I was able to respond to people when asked something but I would still not voluntarily say anything or talk to people. I was still very uncomfortable and anxious. People had always known me as the person who did not talk. My friend even joked that if i did not start talking they would put me in the special ed class.

My friend and I sort of drifted off in 6th grade and the next school year something between us happened and we just forgot about each other. I was already alone most of the time growing up but from that point onward I would move into the situation that I am still in today. In 8th grade I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder by a psychologist from the county. More specifically the Aspergers type. The diagnosis explained a lot to my teachers and parents. The next year I started a program for kids with mental disorders at a high school a bit further away then the school I would‚Äôve gone to if I wasn‚Äôt put in the program. It wasn‚Äôt any different from what they taught in normal classes. It was basically smaller class sizes. I felt more comfortable in these classes but we did have to take electives with the mainstream students. At first nothing much changed in high school from middle school. Still just as uncomfortable and anxious around people as before but during the last 2 years or so I started to really want to have people to talk to and do stuff with, like friends. I think I‚Äôve always wanted friends even in middle school but I just never acknowledged it upfront or paid attention to it. 

Its now been 2 years since i graduated in may of 2018 and nothing has changed, even with my new therapist i started seeing in the spring of 2018. All these years we've been talking about the same thing. Ive been stuck for so long. There has been other things weve talked about and things that were previously uncomfortable for me to share and tell him. For the most part though weve made no progress with the main issue of making social connections. 

Ive just always been terrified of people. I only feel safe speaking and acting out around my immediate family. In fact I‚Äôve always had this view or feeling of the world where my mom, dad, sister and me are one unit and then everyone else i encounter in my life or have yet encountered or just exist in the world feel like strangers or foreigners to me. Like I‚Äôm comfortable in the house my mom, sister and me live in but when I venture out into the world with them it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm stepping out to outer space or to a foreign country. All my interactions with people are so uncomfortable. I‚Äôm scared to approach them or speak to them. When I am out in the world and I do have to talk my heart beat goes up, I start sweating and I start panicking internally like it‚Äôs the end of the world. When I talk my voice is very low and it sounds very different from when I talk to my mom, dad or sister. It has this very mundane neutral tone. Sometimes I even try to change the way it sounds around strangers to something that sounds like what I use with my parents and sister but it never works. It just stays the same. It‚Äôs really frustrating cause I come off as more innocent or disabled when I sound like that. A lot of times I don‚Äôt know what to say or reply when people who aren‚Äôt my parents talk to me. No matter how much I try to act myself, my personality completely changes when I‚Äôm around other people. It‚Äôs like my brain reverts to a really primitive state where my voice has no emotion, I‚Äôm really scared, quiet and want to leave. I just can't express myself. 

In situations where I have talked to people it‚Äôs never gone well. Like one time I was talking to a volunteer staff person at a wolf sanctuary in PA my dad and I visit often. He was actually the one who started talking to her asking questions about the wolves there but I had been wanting to test out my speaking skills all day so I chimed in and asked about the coyotes in the area. I stuttered and stumbled over my words when I spoke. I tried to control my voice but didn‚Äôt know how, all my brain was doing was putting another word in front of the other while retrieving thoughts. This always happens, my brain just detonates and malfunctions when talking to someone I don‚Äôt know. The most humiliating part about that experience in particular is how the volunteer staff person responded to me. She treated me differently than when she responded to my dad. Her voice had changed to a soft spoken one and her answer to my question was noticeably simpler. This happens a lot actually...

Like when I interact with people whether it be in a class, internship or i'm just ordering food at subway people treat me and talk to me like i'm a little kid in a baby voice. I hate it. I just want to be treated and talked to the way they would talk to another person who is 20. People have always treated me this way as if im more innocent or dont know the things I would at my age. It makes me feel even more alienated and left out of the social environment for young adults. I've completed high school and am in a community college. I have the same goals for success and wants as anyone my age would have. I don't know exactly what it is. Is it my timidness? Voice? My aversion to eye contact? Maybe it's my 5,4 height that makes people think I'm way younger than I am. I guess it could be a combo of all.

To sum everything up I just don't feel accepted based on the experiences I've had. I'm also very very afraid of people to the point where it's as if its a natural instinct. Its always been that way and the severity of it has gotten worse over time. I feel like those two things have caused me to miss out on a lot of things/interests. Theres  been this interest ive had but never really felt connected to the community for it. I've always just been this spectator for almost a decade around it. It actually took me like 10 therapy sessions of alluding to it to my therapist to actually tell him. This interest is furries. Okay this part goes a bit off topic but i just wanted to explain why to clear up a bit things since this fandom is infamous for being controversial. 

My affinity for animal characters goes way back to when I was much younger. In fact I was into a specific type of anthropomorphic character that would be known today as a feral. This all started when I was very young, around 4 or 5. I had a big interest for cats and dogs. Particularly seeing them in movies. I liked watching movies like all dogs go to heaven and the 2 homeward bound movies from the 90s. I developed an affinity for canine characters in particular to where I became obsessed with them. Characters being dogs just felt more natural and aesthetically attractive. In fact when I was around 7 or 8 I started to come up with these stories in my head that would have dogs as characters. I‚Äôd imagine what happens in one episode/storyline and I would play it in my head as I came up with stuff while in bed at night. I‚Äôd imagine all of it in 2d animation. This is one of those weird things I did people may find off putting about me. Anyways i started doing this in 2008 when I was about 8 and it continued consistently until about 2012. I sort of forgot about it then as I had different interests coming in. Later in 2012 I found the Anthro/Fursuit part of the furry community. I've watched from the sidelines since.

Anyways i feel like i've missed a lot of things. My fear of people kept me from doing anything. 

Now I‚Äôm 20 and I don‚Äôt know how people act at this age or do for fun. That thought alone causes me anxiety, stress and sadness. I‚Äôve grown up and everything but despite graduating, going to a community college and looking for jobs I still feel 7 years younger. I only have experience talking to my parents and the last time I talked regularly with someone my own age was in mid 2011. I never had someone my own age as a friend in the past 9 years to talk to. On top of this I don‚Äôt know what people my age casually do for fun. The things I do see people do scare me. Even the way I hear people talk intimidates me. It's just all shouting, unrestrained and rambunctious. Meanwhile I'm quiet and when I do talk or laugh it's a low voice and my personality is generally the opposite of the way I described the people i'm afraid of. Whenever I'm approached by one one these people and respond, they're thrown off by my calm and mundane response. I'm even afraid of how big or tall people my age are. The last time i had a friend most people were around my height and i kinda stopped growing at 5‚Äô4 and now that i'm 20 it's so jarring to see all these people who are almost 6‚Äô0. Like i can't believe I'm in the same age group as them.

I know I‚Äôm 20 and I still got a lot of time. But for the longest time I‚Äôve been stuck where I am socially for years and have not gotten less afraid or improved mentally a bit in that time span.  More recently I‚Äôve been stuck the past year or so talking about the same things with my therapist. This January I just gave up but I still don‚Äôt want it to be that way. I‚Äôve seen posts from other people on reddit who are in their 40s and still haven‚Äôt made any friends. I‚Äôm stuck right now and I could very well end up like that. 

I have seen people recommend using discord or twitter to meet new people but I have just as a hard time connecting to people on there as I do in real life. A lot of times I don‚Äôt know what to say like irl. And like i want to say more then just a few words to show people that I‚Äôm interested and care about what they‚Äôre saying but all that comes out of me is ‚Äúok, nice, yes, oh cool, oh‚Äù. It‚Äôs frustrating. I mean I‚Äôll say almost the same thing irl audibly of course but I feel irl I can be a bit more flexible despite my limited vocabulary when approached by strangers. Typing messages online limits so much emotion for all people and misunderstandings can occur as a result. Last year in June I ran into this problem. Long story short, it ended with people bullying me on discord and a Minecraft server. I actually cried irl when trying to tell a discord admin what happened. From then on I decided that if I were ever to pursue a friendship or connection it‚Äôd be in person not online. 

Recently i've sort of reversed my decision but have run into the same problems as before. My therapist actually encouraged me to find a group related to my furry interest but I was already in one anyway and have been encountering the same problems. Such as being very atypical and awkward to the point of people treating me different, getting very confused, ignoring me and even getting mad at me. I try to be myself but im just so incompatible with the way most people talk and think and interpret things, process things. I take things literally, don't understand sarcasm, humor and social cues. A lot of times i just talk so formal and i hate it but its the only way i know how to talk, Formal as if i was at an interview. Worse part in the whole discord idea was being bullied off a server when people knew something was up with me. Saying i reeked of autism. I just cant take it. I try to join conversations but am usually met with some level of aggression and when I try to start them im ignored or they just end very quickly. It took months for me to actually talk in new groups and try to get past anxiety. Almost every time things take a turn for the worst and i'm left scarred from those experiences and even more afraid to speak.

I don't know why but last December i thought something would happen. Maybe where I finally get more involved in the furry community. The month just went on and passed though. Then January, February and spring. We're now two thirds through June.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I'm exhausted, sad and have just lost all hope for connecting to people and living a normal life for someone my age. Like i mentioned before I have been trying to get more involved in the furry community but haven't had too much luck as you can see. Though on top of that the community has always terrified me a bit. The whole furry thing has grown exponentially the last few years and it seems like a huge social jungle when I see furry social media, pages, groups, pics of cons etc.

Anyways the way my ASD affects the way I think and act combined with my severe social anxiety just gets in the way of everything in my life. My interactions with people end up weird and even creepy and end up with people trying to get away from me or treating/speaking to me like I‚Äôm a little kid and not a 20 year old adult. That last thing is so confusing for me and another huge issue in itself. I‚Äôm just too different in the way I think and act as an anti social repellent. This world just isn‚Äôt really for me. I was born with ASD and grew up terribly afraid of people, feeling inferior and different. I‚Äôve felt alienated from society based on the experiences I‚Äôve had. Now I just have no hope. For me, meeting people, connecting and talking would be as likely as winning a billion dollars. It just feels impossible at this point. I‚Äôm incapable of forming relationships with other people besides my parents. I‚Äôve always been that way. All I want is someone to talk to, maybe help me with my creative work and share ideas. I'm just too incompatible though. I just feel so trapped by my circumstances and that I may never break through to the world.

Recently I confessed to my therapist that I wanted to jump off an overpass onto a 12 lane interstate near me. Everything i've tried has not worked. All the online stuff i was suggested by my therapist and job coaches has not worked. I wanted to be happy but the human society/culture has rejected me. The world is so hostile, more then i thought. No one takes the time to understand you or realize you have feelings and are capable of being hurt badly. The only social contact I've had the past decade has been my parents and sister. It hurts so bad that I've had enough. Looking ahead to the 2020s my life will just be filled sadness, depression, loneliness, existential crises and will just be a generally painful experience mentally. 

I'm looking through a journal I wrote near the end of march. Ive gotten worse since. Every year it's the same thing since I graduated in may 2018. I'm alone in this universe. All I wanted was a friend I could talk to. I like drawing feral dogs and wolves. Making stories for them. That's it. Most of my posts on reddit go unnoticed and when someone does respond through dms‚Ä¶ they go away eventually‚Ä¶ and i'm alone again, in the void of the universe.

I dont know what im even going to do after this post. I dont want to be lonely but thats probably what awaits me. :(",lonely,I dont feel accepted because of my autism. The world just feels really hostile to me,2020-06-21 12:53:02

927,XilenceBF,1592706604,1,"I just recently started listening to song lyrics and started crying when I actually heard the lyrics of Passengers ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù. I havent cried since my father passed 9 years ago...

The song to me is basically how I don‚Äôt know how to find people that will stick around. How I keep trying but I end up getting hurt, be it by ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or people I felt I could build a romantic relationship with.

This month marks my 7th year as a single guy. It‚Äôs creeping closer and closer to 1/3rd my life. And that‚Äôs just after the one relationship I‚Äôve had in 2012/2013 from which I got dumped for following my dream.

My last romantic interest was fucked up in all sorts of ways. She was absolutely amazing from the first day I met her but she had a massive self esteem issue. She had a very bad social circle that echoed her negative thoughts. In december she had to move back to her hometown for a year and with a bit of support from my side she managed to break free from them. I tried to be understanding and supportive in the months after and she was doing really well! We started actually talking about dating when she would come back and started making plans and I got really excited.

Fast forward to last month and she just ... stopped. She didnt call me, hardly texted me. When I finally asked her why she said that she has been going to church again and has decided that she really wants someone religious, but that I am oh so important to her and how she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me. How she will ‚Äúnever leave me‚Äù. Then she called me dude for the first time after 9 months of baby......

This is the exact blueprint of all the times I‚Äôve met someone I actually could connect with. Its always real fun in the beginning, then they tell me their shit and I support them, asking nothing back. They start talking sweet to me, show me affection and then disappear for a bit just to return with a ‚Äúyeah you‚Äôre close but *just* not it. Then they meet someone else who they stay with for years and tell me over and over again that I will find someone because I‚Äôm so nice and special and someone will definitely come along who will appreciate me.

Except no one does. I‚Äôve gone through this process 8 times in the past 7 years. And the latest girl will probably meet someone in the coming months and end up really happy, only reaching out to me when she has issues with the dude and needs someone for support as that is my only value to other people.

I don‚Äôt have any other friends who I can rely on when I‚Äôm going through my shit. Every time I opened up to someone they just fade away as well or just plainly ghost me right after I feel like we got close. So I just keep everything to myself these days.

I am so done with people. I really do not see the point anymore in investing in people. They‚Äôre full of shit and only get my hopes up for nothing. 

I‚Äôm just so tired.

We just couldn't find something to agree on doing. We watched a movie, but continued to find nothing to do after. My friends are all super into MTG, but I only play that because they play it, and often find myself not wanting to play it when they want to. My friends rarely get the chance to hang out online, and when they do, things rarely go anywhere. We have a DnD campaign we've just been sleeping on for weeks since every time we try to make it work, there's always someone who can't get on the call. 

I don't want to make any new friends online because I know it won't last. Sometimes I just stand around, with a cold, dead expression on my face, because even though I'm in a house with loving parents and a good brother, I always feel like I'm alone. 

I've done just about everything fun there is to do with my brother, and now any time I try to hang out with him, I get the feeling that I'm just being a burden on him. 

Not to mention, I don't have a girlfriend I can talk to when I'm feeling lonely.

I'm tired and sick and exhausted. I realized today that I have no one to talk to. It's the weekend and I am staring at my kik groups trying to talk to someone and staring at people leaving me on read there too. I had someone meeting me today for some paperwork and just as I was about to leave home. So now I'm home all weekend long seeing no one, talking to no one and not even getting a sad forced smile.

I've been watching the office and I realize I'm essential Michael Scott. There are people who care about me and I know that, but I'm nothing more than a burden and a chore and a bother to everyone. No one really wants me around. No one actually wants to talk to me or deal with me but occasionally they will do so pitifully and honestly despite knowing that it's pitiful it feels so good.

I am probably better connected with the moms of my ""friends"" than I am with the ""friends"" themselves. I stare at my phone waiting to get a reply from someone, either on kik or text or WhatsApp or messenger or literally anything.

I'm not exactly the most attractive guy. I'm cute in the dorky sense of the word but that's not the kinda guy girls want. So I can't really just go out to a bar (once things open up again) and sit at the bar and hope a cute girl sits close enough for me to talk to her. People don't really wanna talk to me in general so I guess I give off weird vibes? 

I just really wish I could find someone for whom I am a priority and who is a priority for me. I'm slowly accepting that I might be single forever. I know I'm 23 but at this age people have hooked up with someone, had fun sex, been kissed out of the blue, gone on cute dates, have great memories with friends, have pictures of themselves with friends that they can put up on the walls in my apartment, have friends who actually remember their birthday (I had 1 ""friend"" wish me), and just have a friend to reach out to when things are tough. And honestly I have none of that...

If I ever start connecting with someone and we chat and have a decent conversation, they either ghost me or decide that I'm not good enough, or they just realize that there are other (better) guys out there. Idk I just kinda wanna not be all alone anymore. I don't wanna have to do half loads in my dishwasher. I don't wanna have to only cook for 1. I just wanna know what it feels like to have a cute girl to kiss every morning and every evening and every night and cuddle up with all night...",lonely,I don't even know how to title this [Rant] [Long] [Probably not worth anyone's time],2020-06-21 11:28:20

One thing I've been thinking about recently is what resources exist across cities and within institutions (e.g. schools and places of employment). I recently did a wellness project at my uni on loneliness and found that my project was basically the only outlet for people aside from peer counseling. I also did some searching in a few major cities and could find surprisingly few resources.

An environment where it is the norm to talk/be/become friends with many people. And as i had never tried such thing before, i decided to finally jump out of my comfort zone and see where it would lead me if i actually talked to people. I knew none of them beforehand, and had really nothing to lose. This led to me having a girl liking/caring about me for the first time in my life. She broke my heart by being with another guy in the period we were 'talking'. Ultimately she cheated on me because i didn't know how to talk or act around girls and how to keep a girl interested. My introvercy had been awaken in me for the first time in a couple of months. I was scared to go and meet her. To take contact. Almost a month after i found out of her cheating i decided to break contact with her on social media and not talk to her in person anymore. My introvercy won. After i was over her, i had to find and establish new friendships and find friends late, when everybody else already had solid friend groups. This was really hard. Especially when you laid in your bed the whole time being sad, not having any energy and being scared to take contact to people. My extrovercy was battling my introvercy in my head. I have not had any real female interaction like one to one since then. Probably 4-5 months with a few party-girl affairs here and there. Life is shit. Im tired of this. I can only see a bad future for me if i stay introverted and not talk to girls. If i continue being in this state of mind, i will probably go to drugs or at least contemplate suicide.

963,Mazes-N-Monsters,1592685672,3,"For the past few years I have been severely depressed due to being in a shitty living/family situation. Despite having a lot of friends, I have always felt very lonely. Often because despite my active efforts to socialize, I don't ever feel like the efforts are reciprocated. None of my friends will ever actively reach out to me or try to talk to me, other than very minor interactions via social media or group chats. And even on social media of group chats, I often feel like nobody cares what I have to say. I know that people, especially at my age (24), are always busy, and I know because of covid-19 physical social interacting has become difficult. Still though, it doesn't feel great when literally nobody will reach out to me and try to have a conversation unless I reach out first.

So I decided to do a bit of an experiment. About a month ago I reached out to one friend I feel the closest with, who's been aware for a while how depressed I've been, and I expressed to him how lonely I've been feeling. How I wish more of our friends would reach out to me more. He said that he understood, and would let our mutual friends know to try and make an effort to reach out to me and talk to me more. So I waited a whole month, and nobody reached out to me, not a single person. I reached back out to my friend asking if he had talk to any of our friends about reaching out to me. His response was, ""Yes, but I have been conservative in my efforts because we don't want to overwhelm you.""

I didn't lash out or anything, but reading that really upset me. ""We don't want to overwhelm you"" felt like a cop out especially because literally none of my friends reached out. I'm fucking lonely. I want to be overwhelmed, at least a little. I want to feel like I'm a person of value by my friends. I want some genuine interaction from my friends without having to basically beg it from each of them.

Today I found out my two best friends went to the beach without me. Here is a little back story.

I am a pretty social person, just have never been able to make many friends. In 10th grade I got into a friend group with about 8 people. It was amazing having a group to talk to and hang out with every weekend. It was the first time I‚Äôve ever had close friends... or so I thought. Turns out a lot of these group members would talk shit behind eachother a backs. Eventually I had to cut them off and I stayed close with 2 of the members in the group, let‚Äôs say Steve and Dan. Me, Steve, and Dan did everything together for a whole summer, last summer. We went to a water park, amusement park, went on hikes, went fishing, went to park, and my favorite, we went to the beach. I LOVE the beach. It was by far the best experience of my entire life and I still have dreams about how much fun I had that whole week. 

After last summer ended and school started up, we still talked but our friendship slowly faded and they eventually began to hang out without me. I sent them both messages about how I really want to get close again, and they were like yeah let‚Äôs do it! But always blew me off. They were my only two friends... and slowly but surely, they stopped giving any shits about me.

Today I realized, via Snapchat, that they are together, at the same beach I had the best week of my life at. When I saw the post I just sat there paralyzed. Why do they get to have a blast and I don‚Äôt? I have always been there for them and am genuinely a very selfless person.  I have long work shifts the next two days and I do not know how I am going to get through them. My only friends, just went to my favorite place, without me. I‚Äôm just paralyzed and sad.

983,an0nbrownchick,1592661146,1,"hi, 2020 has by far been the shittiest year socially and mentally. corona, no graduation, my assault earlier this year and other problems have not helped. what you‚Äôre about to read is gonna sound stupid but it‚Äôs been on my mine for a long time and i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. there are so many things that have gone bad compared to the good. i‚Äôm not sure if i pissed off the universe but i have not been genuinely happy since last year (i‚Äôve had happy moments where they last a few hours tho). anyways, i just graduated high school and moving to college soon in august. high-school was a ride filled with good and bad memories, but senior year sucked. a lot. basically long story short, i got kicked out of my friend group. i‚Äôve known them for 4 years but we became very tight for 2 years. i have strict parents so i can‚Äôt show up to every event but everytime i‚Äôm not there, they talk about me. i don‚Äôt know the actual reasoning behind them disliking me. i do know one of their reasons was that i don‚Äôt show up to a lot of things (again this is due to my parents, i can‚Äôt go out a lot). but they have been knew about that since forever and nothing‚Äôs changed. i think another reason they had was that i talked to other people this year. i‚Äôm usually a introvert who only talked to the group but this year i talked to a few more people outside the group and they didn‚Äôt like that. i‚Äôm not gonna lie, i don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt like me talking to other people. i always put the group first and the new people i talked to were just school friends (i‚Äôve maybe only hung out with them once). i found out they didn‚Äôt like me when they said they wanted to take professional pictures without me. they didn‚Äôt want to regret including me because they felt like i wasn‚Äôt in the group. (they don‚Äôt know that i know) it sucks because they knew i was always insecure and always felt left out (i express them my sad feelings when i don‚Äôt get invited to stuff when they make plans in front of me). looking back on the group, none of them checked up on me except one. i left the country over winter break and when i came back i was sick and only like 2 people checked up on me. whenever i would talk to them of me feeling left out, they would always assure me that they love me and that i was needed. but the past few weeks have said otherwise. they have been talking about me and distancing themselves from me. i must be very naive because i honestly did not expect any of this. i even texted one of the girls in my group and asked her if we were cool. she said of course and made up a few lies about why she removed me from a few things :( it sucks because they act like they like me, in reality they don‚Äôt like me at all. thank you if you‚Äôve read up to this much. again i know this is just dumb highschool stuff but the feeling of being left out and hated sucks. especially when all your life you‚Äôve been avoiding drama and attention because your insecure. plus the other problems from 2020 don‚Äôt help. so anyone who has also experienced being kicked out, left out or forgotten, please let me know how to cope with it. how do you forget about it and stop thinking about the bad times? how do you become happy? only time i don‚Äôt think about it is when i‚Äôm busy and these days i‚Äôm not that busy cause i‚Äôm home all day. thank u in advance.",lonely,"kicked out of the friend group, how to cope? :/",2020-06-20 23:52:26

998,22Wideout,1592637166,1,"I‚Äôve always been a loner...and not by choice. It goes back as far as Kindergarten. I don‚Äôt really know why but nobody wanted to associate with me. All the way through elementary I was isolated.

 I think I kind of gave up around 2nd or 3rd grade trying to make friends, since I was still with the same people through schooling. I remember I would sit alone on the swings at recess. 

 Nobody ever tried to help me out. My parents never tried getting me into new groups, switching schools, contacting other kids parents. Same with teachers. 

 My father actually became quite upset that I didn‚Äôt have any friends and told me, ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt get any other kids phone number by the end of the week I‚Äôd be punished‚Äù

I was scared to do it the entire week up until Friday. We were doing some sort of partner assignment and I mustered up the courage to ask him....

 He responded with, ‚Äúwhy would I want to hang out with you, you don‚Äôt talk to anybody?‚Äù

 I just brushed it off because I expected it.

 My dad didn‚Äôt ‚Äúpunish me‚Äù like he said he would...he just told me how much of an absolute disappointment I was

 And so it was like this all the way through middle school too. Up until my 8th grade year. I was actually gaining some likability from running track that year. I got some kids phone numbers/ social media ID‚Äôs and stuff like that. I had my first and only social gatherings with some kids that following summer. I was finally starting to actually feel normal.....

 That following year right at the start of school I got a really bad concussion. I experienced some bad side affects from it. Anxiety, adhd, depression, sensory issues, panic attacks

 All this caused my grades to drop in a months span. I was kicked out of honors classes. My ‚Äúfriends?‚Äù no longer wanted to associate with me. 

 So I no longer have sports, my high acedemic level, and the few people I ‚Äúassociated‚Äù with. 

 The next few years after that wee absolute hell. The loneliest I‚Äôve ever felt in my life. I didn‚Äôt know how to connect with people. I couldn‚Äôt even try if I wanted to because my anxiety got severely worse. People had already constructed their groups. 

 #THE absolute worst memory I have that I try not to think back on is sitting by myself at lunch every day. Every table was filled up in the cafeteria except one.....and guess who sat there right in the fucking middle of the room

 ^me

 Do you know what it‚Äôs like to have a 100 people make disgusted faces at you for 30 minutes every day?

 I believe this is were my severe anxiety stems from. It felt like all eyes were on me. Every bite I took. It got to a point where I physically couldn‚Äôt eat because I would shake. I ended up skipping lunch or getting detention just to eat by myself. I became underweight and felt like shit all the time, because I didn‚Äôt get that much food at home.

 It continued like this until I graduated 

 I tried community college. At this point I don‚Äôt even care about making new friends. I‚Äôm just trying to make it through class. But low and behold my anxiety is at its worse. Its physically incapacitating. I shake...I twitch...I have full on panic attacks. I drop out of several classes the next 2 years. (I actually had 4.0 semester thanks to covid online classes though)

 So here I am at the present. No hope for friendships or relationships. No experience to help me on the endeavor either. What I would say is scarring PTSD from highschool that I‚Äôll probably never shake.

1000,Braden675,1592634433,1,"Recently I fell back into a level of clinical depression. I've had it in the past, but not for about five years.

A number of things have happened in the past several months. I moved out of a very abusive and confining household at the age of 28, now 29 into my own place for the first time. The region I am in was very expensive before the new recession and only with my teaching job was it possible for me to do this. Abusive mentally, emotionally, and otherwise for more than a decade. This literally happened every day for a decade and a half. I couldn't have anyone over for fear of harrassment and space. Let alone date.

I finally got out three weeks before the pandemic caused closures and isolation. My teaching contract I found out in this period isn't being renewed due to budget. I have saved more than enough to live out the lease though as I look for new work.

I started to become depressed in early April for several reasons. One was trying to heal from years of abusive from others. Now was the job news. The isolation of the pandemic completely threw out a routine I that kept me busy and active.

Doing distance learning as a teacher was demoralizing because most students didn't do work and the entire process seemed pointless. I'm glad it's actually over, but am now unemployed looking for work as there are hiring freezes, an uncertain school year in terms of setting and working conditions, and also budget.

This has been wild coaster is all I can say now with spikes threatening the reopening that has happened entirely.

In the past few months I've found myself with no purpose, sobbing from just trying to process why I had to be in the last living situation I was and all of the pain from it, to being isolated again, and mad at myself for not getting out sooner and just at all the things that have happened overall. I have no friends where I now am and just wonder why this all has been dealt with me.

Living alone to heal has been positive and I know I eventually will find a new job, but I don't know how to process it all and get through it. I've wanted to date too as part of my escape, but now at 29 I feel my twenties are gone and wasted by things I mostly couldn't control and people I'm very angry at now including the pandemic. I see so many others around me related and otherwise already married or have at least bern in long term relationships too and it bothers me now. .

That aside, I \[27F\] just feel like wherever I try to fit into friend circles or online circles, it all just fails, like I can't relate to a single person. Video game circles are the ones I primarily try to get into because most of the games I have happen to be multiplayer games (biggest mistake of my life to be honest). I hate that I can't have fun with everyone else because I'm not at all caught up with any hip Internet lingo or fads in gaming. Outside of those communities is no different. When I was working before the pandemic, it was part of my job to interact and engage with people. I used it as a means to try and bridge a gap in my mind, and seemingly it worked, but then I started running into the same problems of not being caught up with popular trends, people, music, etc. It's not my fault that I don't find a lot of things interesting. This extends to anyone I've come to know growing up. I just never know what to talk about since I don't pay attention to anything other than what is immediately happening in my life. I don't know how or why I developed that way, and I hate it.

He has just been so frustrating for the past few months. I understand that his new friends and girlfriend could cause me to feel left out, but this is different.

He is acting different because of his girlfriend. He is like a different guy around her. He facetimes her until 1-2 am, and we live in the same room, so I can't sleep through his talking and screen brightness. He even went as far as inviting her without telling me on my birthday trip that I planned! He prioritizes her and her feelings over the rest of the family.

He has been planning a trip with his friends, and he said I could possibly tag along. I fully understood that I might not be able to go, but he really got my hopes up by saying he wanted me to join, and this is a very big trip that is cheaper as more people go. At first the logistics of adding me were a problem, but we fixed that by upgrading stuff to add another person (mostly car space). Then, he said he didn't want me going because he wanted alone time with his friends. I am fine with not going, but he basically lied, convinced my dad to pay for the upgrades to his trip, shattered my hopes, and said ""I rather have my friends than my brother (or even both me and his friends) on a once in a lifetime trip.""

Tonight, we were just playing board games, but he wouldn't stop beating up on me in the game. I wasn't even winning, but he just kept it up. He won off of some cheap way that barely fits the rules of the game only because he got such an advantage from screwing me over the whole game. My sister agreed he really bullied me, and she said she didnt have fun either. He almost did it to win in front of his girlfriend who was playing with us.

My parents are upset that he won't include me in the trip. I am upset about how he is treating the friend (me) he has had since I was born versus some girl he has known for 6 months and some guys he has know for maybe a year.

I went on r/MakeNewFriendsHere and posted about myself, not expecting anything and it was sort've a desperate act from feeling extreme loneliness. I had no local friends since all my friends went back to college and I was outcasted in high school. I'm usually the type to just go on Tinder and talk to boys and go on dates. But this time, I legit just wanted a friend, or even just a little bit of company. 

I have always been social irl, dressed up nicely, went to a lot of parties, hit on dudes and it is very untypical of me to break down and go to reddit to make friends. This is when I met someone we will just call T. Hes 22M and seemed really genuine about making a new friend and we originally bonded over fashion. We became like reddit penpals, sending each other long messages about our day and interests. Reddit sucks as a messaging platform and we decided to switch over to Snapchat. 

Snapchat make us both seem so real. I was comfortable enough to exchange pictures and tell each other about our friends and family. He was handsome and it certainly caught me off guard, and I think I also caught him off guard as well. We both had assumptions that people on reddit are weird but that couldn't farther from the truth.

The biggest lesson I learned is about barriers. Me and T had so many barriers from distance, to religion, to social life, to upbringing and even education. Despite all of that, we managed to build a really fun friendship. It taught me that humans are capable of connecting to each other, that I am capable of that and that all I had to do was just let go of my judgement and prejudice. The way T grew up and the surroundings he is in I would've thought he was a Neo-Nazi or something. My prejudice was ugly. We've been talking almost everyday since we met. And I have accepted the fact that I'll maybe never meet him, and if I do manage to even accomplish even that, it would just be for a few days here and there. 

So what. I've learned so much him and I genuinely love him. There are so many people in this world, some that you might really get along with and are just physically scattered.

1041,sweetandromeda,1592607215,7,"I'm a 24F and I struggle with loneliness like pretty much everyone else here. At this point, I'm trying to focus on my career and distance myself from men unless I feel enough interest. I can't settle in one place just yet, so it's tough.

So I'm going to ramble...

The thing is, as dumb as it sounds, I never thought men ever felt the same. I always had the impression they only craved sex or lighter pleasures in life. Or that they just didn't feel much of anything. I made it a goal to not feel anything, too.

Seriously, I'm not saying this as a bitter woman. I swear. I didn't like thinking men ""only want one thing"" but it's something that I was taught and saw within relationships in my family. I was raised by a woman who experienced years of abuse and hung with some rough crowds. So my childhood was sheltered. Background checks and consistent supervision. She kept telling me from grade 2 through university that men are ""different"" like that. Women in my family just accepted that kind of abuse. Since then, I've kept my distance from men. Never had much for guy friends and dated very little. I accepted compliments, and that's it.

I've been reading posts on here and on a few other subreddits, and it's the first time I've seen any evidence that men ever craved real connection. I didn't know men ever felt like that. I'm sorry, but I am completely serious.

I'm glad this place proved me wrong and you all deserve to feel loved.",lonely,Kinda glad I found this place,2020-06-20 08:53:35
1042,amedmond,1592606804,2,"Hi everyone. I have everything I‚Äôm supposed to have in life that‚Äôs supposed to make me a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù. A college degree, a full time job, a high salary, a great apartment where I live by myself, a wonderful boyfriend who I‚Äôve been with for over a year, and supportive parents and grandparents. Yet, I realized that I‚Äôm not satisfied in life and I actually feel depressed. I feel depressed because I feel like I don‚Äôt have real friends or a true support network. To add clarity, I‚Äôm a black female. I‚Äôve always felt like I was too black to fit in with the white kids and too white to fit in with the black kids. I‚Äôve never fit in and so it‚Äôs always been difficult for me to make friends or truly feel like I connect with people to the point where I could have a real friendship. I do have 3 friends but 1 is a married man so we can‚Äôt hang out outside of work like I would expect to wirh a real friend, 1 has 3 children so again we can‚Äôt spend that much time together, and 1 spends 99% of her free time with her boyfriend. We hang our sometimes but I‚Äôm always the one that initiates it. So it‚Äôs really draining and disappointing to feel like people don‚Äôt think enough of you or value you enough to want to initiate plans with you first. So I essentially feel like I have no friends. It‚Äôs depressing because if I want to go somewhere I don‚Äôt have someone I could invite to come along with me. When I get married I honestly don‚Äôt even know who I could ask to be a bridesmaid. I haven‚Äôt had a real birthday party since the 5th grade because I don‚Äôt have enough friends to warrant having a birthday party. I also live alone. The friends that I do have, I feel aren‚Äôt interested in talking about things that really matter to me like emotional things I may be going through which is why I don‚Äôt feel supported. Also I‚Äôve been out of college for a year  and haven‚Äôt had luck making friends outside of school (not that I made friends in school anyway). It feels even more lonely because it feels like literally every other individual  on this planet has this amazing friend group and network of people that support them and I‚Äôve never had that. I‚Äôve never even had a friend get me a birthday gift. So I was wondering if anyone else could relate to me and my situation, or if anyone has any advice on either how to make friends or how to accept being alone and not having friends so that it doesn‚Äôt make you sad.",lonely,A depressed 24 year old who has no one.

I have a lot of friends, and during school (highschool) I‚Äôd talk to them everyday. Goofing off and talking with friends at School was really fun for me, and I‚Äôve realized since covid that I took school for granted. Once highschool switched to online during mid March I still kept in contact w my friends online frequently, but it doesn‚Äôt feel the same. I feel like I‚Äôm losing the strong bond and connection I had with my friends irl, bc talking online isn‚Äôt the same. It‚Äôs rlly hard to text people when none of us have anything going on, and it‚Äôs a lot different compared to when we were actually talking face to face. I think because of this I‚Äôve felt lonely, i know I have friends but I miss hanging out w them irl. I‚Äôm an only child of a single parent (my mom), and she goes out a lot to take care of my uncle who had a stroke, so I‚Äôm left alone in the house a lot. I struggle with frequent anxiety and depression, and I used to take medication for it but I recently went off bc it didn‚Äôt seem to be working. even though this break helped me sort out my mental health, I‚Äôve started to think in my head that I‚Äôm alone when I‚Äôm rlly not. I have a problem with glamorizing other people‚Äôs lives in my head and thinking that I‚Äôm a failure constantly, my mind is my own bully. But in reality, I‚Äôve accomplished a lot. I‚Äôve won certificates and gotten into prestigious programs, I‚Äôm smart and talented. But in my head I still believe that I‚Äôm not good or talented enough, or that there‚Äôs always someone who‚Äôs doing better. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong w me, I know I‚Äôm doing well and I should be happy, but my mind convinces me that I shouldn‚Äôt be. I don‚Äôt rlly know if it‚Äôs ok to hang out with people this summer, bc I know some of my friends might have strict parents who won‚Äôt let them bc of covid.

maybe that's why i have this built up ego

I was really numb to insults and slurs that are pointed to me so I calmly and said in a monotone like voice said ""Why are you yelling at me for?"" She stopped yelling and starts laughing erracticly and I told her to stop laughing and be serious.

She said ""You are a toxic piece of manipulative shit (my name inserted here) I wish you were dead!"" I was calm and took it with little no care I knew what she was talking about. Her now Ex boyfriend, came to me about advice because she was a really aggressive and she was toxic, keyed his car, slashed his tires, broke his windows, cut something in the engine I believe and she was mad over a like on instagram, the girl had a sister that was hotter and the Ex boyfriend liked the photo because she looked good.

He asked me if he should break up at this point and I said it was for the safety because she can actually injure him badly.  And I said if that did happen an restraining order can be put against her and charges for assault. I told him to do what's best and I told him to love someone for them but if they control you and damage your things or hurt you, you can't be in that type of abusive Relationship. I do want the best for everyone and she is very extra. Aggressive. 

This woman yelled at how much she loved him and how much she wanted a future with him but why control and go and damage his things over little things?

In high school I had people I would hang out with in school, but I was never invited to hang out with them after school. I also never really texted them outside of school. After high school, I didn‚Äôt keep up contact with any of them.

My first couple of years of college, I had a large friend group. However, I completely ruined all of these friendships. I moved into an apartment with a couple of friends, but never really interacted with them much. I got into a relationship for a year and a half and during that time I slowly fell away from all of my other friends, focusing on my relationship and their group of friends. When it ended, I realized I had nobody left. I find it hard to initiate conversation and I was in a state where me and my apartment mates ignore each other‚Äôs existence. It‚Äôs been two years since we broke up, and I haven‚Äôt found any new friends since then.

I had one other friend, but they admitted they had a crush on me and drunkenly tried to kiss me multiple times, and so I had to cut them off. 

Now I‚Äôve just graduated college, and I realize I have nobody. The only person I know in real life that still texts me just asks for help on schoolwork, and we have never hung out (only had a couple of classes together.)

1089,lonelyinlove121,1592572176,1,"I first began browsing this subreddit a couple years ago when I was going through a break-up and needed a way to cope. I read the heartbreaking stories of loneliness from many different walks of life: young and old, men, women and children.

My own experience with loneliness is quite simple. My father cheated and divorced my mother shortly after my birth. My father was harsh with my upbringing due to his fears that my mother, who won custody, would raise his son to be a sissy.

For most of my schooling, I was able to make a few friends although I battled with social anxiety and low self-esteem. After high school I lost contact with most of my friends. At college I made a few ‚Äústudy-buddies‚Äù but not really true friends.

After graduating, I pursued further studies. At that time, I experienced what might have been depression although I was never formally diagnosed. My studies were severely impacted and I barely managed to graduate.

Afterwards, I found work at a start-up in a basic administrative position. During that time, I began to think about my life. Despite my desire to do something meaningful in the world, I had wound up being quite average in most regards. I was friendless and worked a job that barely covered my necessities.

One day as I was walking home, I was suddenly hit with a deep and profound feeling of loneliness. Two years passed, yet I continued to feel intensely lonely and isolated. At work, I had been promoted a couple times and was no longer doing administrative chores. Despite this, my confidence was quite low.

One summer, we temporarily hired a vibrant, energetic university student during her summer break and I was assigned as her supervisor. Over time we grew close and on one occasion she flirted with me but I rejected her advances because of my position as her supervisor . After that incident, I distanced myself from her despite reciprocating her feelings.

After she left, my loneliness deepened so I threw myself into my work. Over the next two years, I‚Äôd successfully coordinated a couple important projects and also managed to make a couple friends through work. I felt fulfilled to an extent.

Then one day, out of the blue, an old acquaintance who I‚Äôd been in contact with over the years began messaging me constantly: from the moment I woke, to when I got ready for bed. Eventually she asked me if I ever had any feelings for her and I candidly admitted that I did at some point.

We met for drinks and about a month later, we were in a relationship. It was a rushed decision. While I was a quiet, introverted guy, she was an extravert with a very busy social life that included regular parties and clubbing. I went to a few with her, but I never enjoyed those things and would usually wait in a corner until she was ready to leave.

She earned far more than I did and her friends and acquaintances were all in her income bracket. I slowly began to resent that I earned so much less. I hated my old run-down car, especially in comparison to her flashy new car. I hated that I couldn‚Äôt take her to the sort of fancy restaurants she was accustomed to. I constantly felt like I needed to compensate for lacking so much. I‚Äôd never felt so inadequate in my life.

Several months later, our disparities began to affect the relationship. My insecurities manifested as bitterness and mistrust. My mistrust was an especially huge issue. My father‚Äôs betrayal of my mother had made me a very untrusting person and as my girlfriend and I grew apart, I began to become more and more suspicious of her. I never outright accused her of cheating but she could sense my mistrust.

We started having frequent arguments and one day she revealed that she was no longer attracted to me and that she had feelings for an ex and wanted to meet him privately to ‚Äúfind closure‚Äù. At this point, perhaps a rational person would have realised that the relationship was over but I had developed an unhealthy attachment and I held on desperately to the fact that she hadn‚Äôt outright broken up with me.

I made all sorts of desperate gestures to win her back like sending her a bouquet at her office and asking her out on dates (all of which she declined). Eventually she grew tired of everything and broke up with me in person.

In the ensuing grief, I took some time off from work. I couldn‚Äôt cope and my performance took a hit. About 5 months later, she messaged to tell me that she had moved on and found someone new. I wished her all the best.

As time passed, I was able to look at the things more objectively. Truth was that I felt very lonely in the relationship. She spent most of her time partying and travelling. When we did spend together, she was more engrossed with her phone. We lacked true connection and in the end I felt more like an accessory to her perfect life than an actual partner and companion.

I started working on my problems. I began therapy and journaling. Through meditation and introspection, I learned some simple truths. At the end of the day, you have only yourself. Life is rarely filled with constants. People will inevitably come and go as they are swept up in the currents of their own lives; their own goals and desires.

You must learn to become comfortable in your solitude. You must take care of your own emotional wellbeing. It‚Äôs unfair to expect someone to come into your life and magic away all of your suffering. A romantic partner isn‚Äôt your personal therapist/motivational coach and isn‚Äôt responsible for your happiness. Getting a partner isn‚Äôt going to make your depression, anxiety or loneliness disappear.

Unhealthy relationships begin when you enter with the mindset that the relationship is going to solve a problem or deficiency in your life. Sadly, many people think, ‚ÄúIf only I had a girlfriend/boyfriend I would be better off.‚Äù The truth is that you won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs like bringing a friend into your house that you haven‚Äôt cleaned in years and handing them a broom and telling them, ‚ÄúClean this up.‚Äù

Confront your life! Identify the sources of your pain and deal with them. Clean your own house! It won‚Äôt be easy, and it may take years (I‚Äôm certainly far from completing the necessary work), but it will be worth it in the end.",lonely,A relationship won't solve your loneliness.,2020-06-19 23:09:36

articles were written, editorials were written, phone calls started coming, and there

1111,illustrious_error21,1592545549,1,"A little quick background, about my self.

In this past 10 or so years, i have lost many people in my family.
Grandpa, died about 13 years ago.
Father, 12 years ago.
Older sister, 7 years ago.
And lastly, my mother, just 5 years ago.

Now, i'm in care of my grandma with occasional help from auntie and uncle.

I fail to go college, because financial reason and it sucks.

I have very few friends, and it's been years since the last we had meaningful conversation. But, we still meet occasionally at local mosque for friday prayers.

I had two persons that I consider as best friend. My path crossed with my second best friend after many personal and emotional conflict, and a sharp difference in the way we think. What he always like to think is violence is always the best way to resolve problem, and it's end up causing more problem between me, him, and our other classmates. So, I decided that I have to go away from him, slowly, and finally never meet him again. Though sometimes I genuinely worry about him.

My first best friend is, well... She is my crush now. It's hard to talk to her, because she don't know my feeling to her. If she know, I just not prepared to deal with what will happen next. Sometimes she ask my help, anything from mundane problem even to emotional problem. We have many things in common, even though she is extrovert. She is maybe with someone else now.

Anyway, it's been a while since the last time I ever physically meet and talk with my friends. I used to this loneliness, but it become more and more unbearable after graduation. I had no job for now, little to zero contact with my peers, and therefore I feel like a useless piece of shit with no purpose.

I have been thinking many stupid things, like ending my life. But, there is some things that keeps me form doing it.

I feel a responsibility for my brother, he is just 12 years old but he is developing, better than me in some aspect. I'm more than willing to take his financial responsibility to ensure his future doesn't end up like me.

I had a dream of happy life with my crush, basically forming a family with her. Even though maybe it's very unlikely, I still want to know how things will turns out.

If I can, I want to take my grandma to Hajj. I want to thank to her with this. She is as always in good health, fortunately.

And, lastly. I just want enjoy simple life, at some quiet place. At very least I don't want to life in paycheck to paycheck. No debts allowed except mortgage because it's nigh impossible to build my own house ground up from zero, especially if you live in third world country.

I never feel the warmth of a hug. Not the one that I remember. If someone hug me, maybe I will just start crying for no reason. Sometimes crying can help ease my emotion, but I know that it will never erase the problem it self. And now, my emotion is flatlined, just neutral from graduation until now, with only one short emotional outburst. Oddly, I miss crying, sometimes, as a means to easing.

Honestly, I genuinely don't know what I want to talk about here. Just venting and lashing out.

Feel free to talk to me, if you want to. If not, then that is okay. I mean... I just trying to be nice and humble in this cruel world.

I just want to feel desired. If we ever do have sex it‚Äôs transactional. She has never had an orgasm, never had sex before me.

1122,HootHoot44,1592539362,1,"This year has been shitty...for everyone. In this era of not being able to leave my house I turned to relying on my interests more at home to keep me occupied. Playing video games, watching YouTube videos on certain topics, rewatching TV shows, training my dog...

When I realized something. I am very much alone in all that I do. My fiancee sits in the recliner, watching his favorite shows, goes golfing, occasionally chuckles at his friends texts and conversations in messenger group chats, seems blissfully content...and I'm twiddling my thumbs. ""Oh you have to watch this funny video!"" ""I'm watching my own video"" he says. ""Ooh look at this awesome picture of Sophie I took today while I was training her!"" ""Yep"" he says. ""This video game would be so much more fun if you played with me!"" ""Its not my type of video game"" he says. ""Aww look what we can end up doing on our honeymoon! This would be fun!"" ""That's way too far away to think about"" he says. ""We should go fishing! It's been a long time!"" ""I only fish for catfish, you don't like catfish"" he says. 

So then I turn to my mom, who's the next person I'm closest to, but quickly realize she's trying to escape conversation when she suddenly cuts me off and changes the subject to something else if it's something she doesn't care about...that's really my entire list of people I have conversations with. I wouldn't consider myself having any friends, not my own age anyway. I have a few coworkers I conversate with if we dont get caught talking on the job, but once i get home it's just me and the cat...not alone but lonely. Theres nobody that I can randomly text to talk about the exciting new thing, or future plans, or even just something we would find interesting to discuss. Even the people who do share certain interests with me don't get ""excited"" about it like I do so I don't bother them about it. 

Today I found myself planning future trips and vacations, imagining all the freedom we can have once COVID-19 is controlled. My ultimate dream vacation is to stay on site at Disneyworld and after watching a few Disney vids I picked up my phone about ready to text about the neatest thing I just learned and....froze there. My finger hovered over the screen as the fluttery excitement in my chest faded and I realized no one would care except me. Then the empty space in the room and the barely one page worth of contacts on my phone glared at me. And half of those contacts are the pre loaded contacts Verizon puts on your phone for tech support. Then I start questioning myself. Is it weird for me to get excited about something in the future that might not happen? Shouldn't I be able to just enjoy my hobbies and interests by myself without feeling this way? I'm grown up shouldn't this be social life norm at this point? Even the two bridesmaids in my wedding are more like aquaitences, one a distant friend who moved on with her life and quit talking to me after she landed a career job and got her own house 100 miles away, the other is the fiancee of the best man. 

Is this a normal occurance? Like is this feeling something to just suck up and say ""yep that's just adult life it is what it is""? My life the past few years since graduating college has been ""lonely but not alone"", especially since I'm not stressed to the max about assignments and can relax and do things I like to do again...albeit by myself most of the time....

I'm constantly always going over to my friends houses and I'll do stuff like get me something to eat on the way and I'll buy them food too or remember their favorite drinks so that if I stop to get me a drink on the way, I'll buy them one too and if I find out I missed someone because I didn't know they'd be their, I kinda feel like shit.

But this can only go so far with friends. I want someone special where I can do this stuff. Get them flowers, something cliche. Or fuck, I hope they hate flowers. Flowers are nice, but fuck it, if they hate flowers then that's just another thing I get to be on top of and remember whatever else to get them that would make them happy. 

And I know I shouldn't want someone that likes me because I spoil them and I don't. there's plethora of other things I'd love to do for someone special that doesn't take any money but shows them I'm there for them and them only and no matter what, it's us against whatever. I'm honestly just paraphrasing a lot because I suck at a lot of things I guess.

I'm just really tired of drugs, alcohol, and depression. If I try to be healthy and stop, depression kicks into overdrive. 

Everything feels so bland, bleak, gray, dull, and repetitive. Go to sleep on time, wake up feeling refreshed, go to work, come home, work on my hobbies (very passionate, just no motivation), maybe hang out with a friend or two, might spend sometime on a couple apps looking for a special connection, go to sleep. Rinse and repeat. But everything feels so damn dull and boring within that time. As if there's just something missing. Unexplainable void.

So when I do drugs, it simply passes the time. Shoots me forward in time, whilst at the same time I don't really notice it.

Sure it's fixing the problem, to an extent. I've fixed the void, but now I'm just wasting time that I feel could be spent making memorable cute moments with someone.

The least you can do is share it as a post or story on social media if you don't know whom you can send this to personally who is going through their worst time as many might not tell us what they are facing but if this catches their eye, I hope this makes a difference to them.

For example, I realized that I probably wouldn't have even met these people if I had decided to join a different club. I probably would've never bonded with them if I had carpooled with someone else for that one trip, or if I had decided to hike one trail instead of the other, or if I hadn't asked for their numbers to stay in touch and just stayed as acquaintances.

And that's only counting the decisions I was in control of. What would've happened if my friend didn't show up to the game night I invited her to? What would've happened if he sent that last-minute invite to join his trivia team to someone else? 


We don't give enough credit to the sheer coincidences that intersect our lives with others, or the fact caring for other people is a conscious choice we make every day. Either of us could suddenly decide to stop caring and walk away from each other lives.

Based on what I know, I already don‚Äôt have that much in common with most people I‚Äôve ever encountered, and I don‚Äôt even know how to start conversations so I‚Äôve just been waiting these past couple years to see if anyone braver would come talk to me but it never happens.

My friends are beginning to drift as everything has been said and it's getting hard for me to make any new friends. The fear I mentioned up the paragraph has been getting worse and worse and it's gotten to the point of constant paranoia. Even going to therapy hasn't been helping, as my therapist has literally laughed in my face about my fear and offered absolutely no help or suggestions (cannot leave either, my dad thinks he's great when really he's not). 

There is a lot of issues I suffer from too, such as not remembering about 3-4 years of my life (when I was 7 to 10-11 years old), having ptsd, anxiety, and depression. To couple with that, although not an illness, I am extremely touch-starved.

Now- I have been designing for days from breaking out of an art block just surrogate people to hold. I've went and I hit a workable design. Arms, legs, and head from raw material.

I am comfortable with my career, I love what I do. But i'm 21 and I'm still a virgin, and it's not even that I'm not good looking or that I can't talk to girls, it's just that for some reason or another I never go further, maybe I'm afraid of telling girls that I find them attractive, maybe my personality is shit when it comes to that, I really don't know why I'm shit when it comes to dating. Every time I connect with a girl they just ignore my advances, or they are always more interested in my friends than in me. And I don't know man, before lockdown going out with my friends, goinf to parties, doing stuff kept me happy. But right now I am really craving more than just friendships. I'm crazy attracted to one of my best friends, who was dating another friend, and while I've accepted that nothing is ever going to come out of our relationship, it still hurts seeing her with other people. It doesn't even really hurt because I can't be with her, it hurts because no matter what I do, no matter what other girls I try to talk to or how many dating apps I try to use, I still can't ever do anything beyond friendships. it's the single aspect in my life where I have developed severe trust issues, but I do try to get over them. I just... fuck... I just feel at this point I'm going to die a very lonely person... probably not true (or I hope it isn't true), but right now it feels overwhelming. And while people around me probably notice my lack of relationships, I don't think they understand how devastating it is, and whenever I try to talk about it, they can't understand, they always dismiss be by telling me, just do it man.

1148,ArAMITAS,1592527549,1,"When I moved in February I never thought we would be facing a pandamic that would have everyone social distancing. Ive wanted to move up north from FL for years and finally made it happen. It wasn't easy as I did long-time friends and family, but I knew I'd meet new people.

First 2 months before I lost my job things where great. I was trying to find a church and had almost settled on one. Then COVID-19 hit. I was laid off and couldn't find work. I spent 2 months home unemployed. Took a small camping trip that was awesome, but again alone. Yes I've felt lonely, but somehow it hadn't hit me hard until now.

I finally got a job offer over a week ago and decided to go back and visit family and friends in FL before I started working. 

Visiting family and having some good times with friends really made me realize how lonely I really was. At least I have a job next week so I'll be talking to people.

It's just that those type of friendships are not easy to replace. The chemistry of a great group of guys doesn't happen overnight. I knew that when leaving, but this pandemic has made making friends so much harder.

It also made me realize that I'm only going to see family about twice a year.

I'm glad I decided to make this move, but 2 months of isolation has really not been great for my mental health. To much time to think. I felt like I was loosing my mind at times.

One of the worst parts is that people haven't really thought too much of my situation. No one has gone out of their way to check up on me. My own brother won't answer his phone the majority of the time. 

Going back home felt like I was stepping back into society and only one person acknowledged that it must have been weird being alone in a new city.

But then I feel empty again. I feel like anyone else isnt trying keep things going. I say things like ""Hi"" and ""How are you doing today"" so that I could find some sort of a conversation starter, but it always ends up being dry and boring for both, so its no use. 

So I feel like I have plenty of people, who know who I am and know what I do, yet I feel like I only know few of them, cause they dont speak with me daily. I feel like if I dont try to speak with all of them, Im abandoning them and that makes me a bad friend. 

Im a boring person. Im not super interested about anything and I feel like only thing I can talk about is my paranoia, nightmares and dark toughts. But I want wholesome friends!

So I‚Äôm 16, I have been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years and he is the most social person I know. I‚Äôve always struggled with keeping friendships and socializing. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt hang out with his friends much and I feel like it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt want me to feel lonely because I have nobody else but him. However he‚Äôs going to be hanging out with like 10 of his friends tomorrow for the first time in a while.  
I had someone invite me to go to the lake with her and hang out for the day and I was so excited. Until I asked my mom and got my fucking soul crushed. My mom said that we‚Äôre still in a pandemic and it‚Äôs too dangerous - I live in Canada and right now restaurants are opening, beaches, hairdressers, water parks etc. So I don‚Äôt know how the fuck it‚Äôs too dangerous for me to hang out with one person for a day when I‚Äôm able to see my boyfriend all the time. I told her she‚Äôs ruining my high school experience and I‚Äôm never forgetting this because it‚Äôs the only time I will ever be invited to hang out with someone other than my bf. And I see people hanging out with friends ALL THE TIME. Fuck. I‚Äôm so upset about this. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck I‚Äôm going to do tomorrow when he‚Äôs out having so much fun and I‚Äôm just waiting for him to come back. I just honestly fucking hate my life right now and I know I sound like every teenager but no one understands how hard it is having no friends, but having a super social boyfriend and getting jealous when he hangs out with his friends.

2015-2016 I don't step ‚Äùoutside‚Äù except going to school or extra classes because I lose my confident. 

2017, is the most neutral year but I'm still glad because that the happiest year since 2015. The first time I went ‚Äùoutside‚Äù for the first time aside that going to school or extra classes. 

2018 I felt lonely that being home made me felt homesick. I felt really sick again that year, the feelings from 2015 came back.

2019, I finally have some good friends. But I been alone for so long that it felt uncanny to actually have friends. I‚Äôm dumb so I pushed them away when we got closer. That year I really enjoy being alone and not wanting anyone with me. 

I don't realise how alone I am until I noticed that most of my classmate( they are really nice I enjoy their company) have this ‚Äùfriends group chat‚Äù that consists of their ‚Äùbest friends‚Äù.  It‚Äôs been 3 years since I have that sort of group chat. I looked back on my chat with some of my friends/ acquaintance and most of them are all about homework/ school stuff. I miss having friends group that talk stupid stuff but I don't want to risk losing friends again.

2020
The first time I hang out with my friends. I‚Äôm happy but I‚Äôm uncomfortable all the time. I just want to go home all the time. So, I rejected all of my friends‚Äô invitation all the time if they ask me to hang out.

I almost 18 this year. I graduated high school last December. This August I‚Äôm going to pre-university, I hope I could be a better person. 

Please treat your friends nicely. 2015, ruined me so much. I used to be happy, had a good relationship with my family, friends, strong faith. I started to lost faith in my religion. Every night, I prayed so much to have good friends. And I stopped pray one day because I lost my will, I started to have suicidal thoughts.I started to fight with my parents which I won't do at all in 2014. Back in 2014, I treated my family so well and now I talked back to them, made my mum cry ( I know I am total ass). I felt bad to this day. No mum should cry because of their children.

In my teens, even though I was alone and I did feel sad about it, but that was nothing compared to what I felt in my early twenties. No girl was ever interested in me, ever. I felt so alone but I had my studies to distract myself from that. I remember the sleepless nights listening to radio on my phone. 

I always knew it was because of how I look, because my friends who are good looking were doing just fine. But I didnt know how bad it was. Even my brother, he lives with his gf now. 

But today after a long time i took a selfie randomly. I looked at it hard for a while and it made me realize so much. It's so laughable to think that a woman will be interested in that lol. How did I even think it was possible in the first place? I'm a fu**ing joke lookwise lmao. It's never gonna happen. People with bad looks are screwed for ever in this world imo. I should've realised this long ago. 

If I consider a normal human lifetime of 70 years, I've 44 more years on this planet. I just dont know how I can survive that long like this.

1182,MiddleConcert,1592485511,1,"All I see is people partying, driving around with their friends, just hanging out and having a good time. Obviously social media doesn't do a good job in portraying reality, so I can see why it would not be an accurate representation of everyone in my age group. In my case, this fact doesn't really matter because it doesn't change anything for me. I would love to be a part of all those endeavours, but I feel like my time is running and nothing is changing in my social life, no matter how hard I try. 

I started college this semester and I tried making new friends. From being very alone during middle and high school, I realized I needed to try even harder to make lasting connections. And then the pandemic came around and took all my acquaintances away from me. I guess I could have tried to keep in touch with some through social media, but from feeling unwanted through most of my schooling, I felt like this would be an awkward move. Me and this other girl chatted for a while though, but it came to my realisation that the connection wasn't really strong because she didn't initiate any chats. So that died out. With that, my hope is fading for actually finding friendships whatsoever.

I do feel like I am worth social connections for sure, there's no questions about that. I am kind and caring, sure a bit shy, but nothing extreme.

We broke up two years ago. It was her idea. I thought things had been perfect, evidently I was wrong. We tried to be friends for about a year, that failed. She left for college and had another boyfriend within a month. I think they‚Äôve been together ever since.

She‚Äôs home now. I just recently learned about her new partner. It broke me. I thought I was over her, guess I wasn‚Äôt. I never told her I loved her. We agreed not to use the word frivolously, and later, when I was sure, we weren‚Äôt together, and I thought it would make her angry.

I wrote her a letter. Told her she was my first love, how I‚Äôve loved her for years, how I miss her. I told her I hope she has a happy, beautiful life, with whoever she chooses to share it with. I put it in her mailbox at about 4 am. She should find it in a few hours.

The best I can realistically expect is a polite acknowledgment, if that. But the tortuous fantasies won‚Äôt stop. The idea she‚Äôll come back. Once she knows how I feel, something will change. I know this will not happen, but my heart aches for it none the less.

I try to tell myself that there are other people. Amazing people I will meet, admire, adore, and one day, maybe, fall in love with. But here, now, in this moment, I can see nothing but her in the arms of another. I‚Äôve never experienced pain like this. I‚Äôm going to try and sleep.

Can I be a high school student again who drinks illegally, sneaks to a party and plays NSFW truth or dare?

Can I go back to the fucking prom and have a cutie accompany me?

Can I be a 16 year old who has sex with another relatively inexperienced teen after some random festival in his home country?

Can I have someone say ""I love you"" and me saying it back as a teen?

No.

People experiencing loneliness will sometimes have **many social connections,** online and IRL, and yet experience a feeling of **isolation and disconnection from other humans.**

So, what are the **less common signs of loneliness?**

**1)** **You always feel tired** 

\- A 2011 study found a link between loneliness and fragmented, messy sleep

**2)** **You‚Äôre taking long showers**

\- Multiple 2013 studies found that people who were experiencing sensations of loneliness were more likely to take long, hot showers and baths- it made them feel immediately better

**3)** **You‚Äôre catching lots of colds**

\- physical isolation and loneliness have been associated with a bunch of different health problems, including a lowered immune system

**4)** **You‚Äôre binge watching lots of movies and TV shows** 

\- A 2015 study found that there's a correlation between feelings of loneliness and a tendency to binge-watch television series

**5)** **You spend lots of time on social media**

\- Social media often acts as escapism if you‚Äôre feeling low or isolated

**6)** **You have no one to lean on**

\- There‚Äôs no one you feel comfortable talking about your problems with.

**7)** **You feel like no one understands you** 

\-  The people around you don‚Äôt ‚Äòget‚Äô you

**8)** **You feel low** 

\- isolation and loneliness can make you feel sad and hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

**Loneliness and isolation** tends to be due to lack of **meaningful connections**\- not having friends and family who **understand, love and support you, and whose values align with yours.**

**If you're looking for places to meet new friends online check out...**

* Local **Facebook Groups**
* Friendship apps such as **Bumble BFF** &amp; **Serendip -** find like-minded friends nearby, like a dating-app
* Website/App **MeetUp -** for local events centred around your interests

**If you're feeling desperate here's some useful sources:**

* You can call **Samaritans** free  on 116 123, if you're feeling low, lonely, lost, or suicidal. They'll listen to you and help talk you through your worries and troubles.
* For men aged 15 to 35 **CALM** have a helpline for you to talk through: Phone: 0800 58 58 58 (everyday 5pm-midnight)
* Likewise, if you're **feeling depressed or anxious you can always make an appointment with your GP.** Seeking professional help when you need it is strength, not a weakness.",lonely,Unspoken symptoms of loneliness,2020-06-18 18:56:53

All my life I've been a very sensitive person inside, I don't think that's a weakness though, but it can definitely be a burden. People have used me a lot in the past. That's another story though. So basically, because I'm sensitive and really bubbly it's very difficult for me to make guy friends, for some reason they always end up avoiding me or shunning me from groups. Usually they say it's because they think I'm overly sensitive and a bit of a pussy. Some just plain don't like me, and I'll be honest.. I'm just really intimidated by guys now when it comes to friendships. I'm really shy, and very sweet when I want to be, but they usually think that's weird and like I'm a girl. I take friendships really seriously too, and most people don't now I guess, so if I make a new friend no matter how new I usually try to be the most open armed I can be and loving. But people seem to find that as odd I guess. Anyways.. Girls now. So because of this I basically just have a bunch of girl friends. They are nice, some are very cool but I never can really be full on friends with them because well, they are swarmed by guys usually every time I want to or do hang out with them. Which makes me really uncomfortable, because 9 times out of 10 it's mainly because they are all hot for her and thirsty and simping. Which I can read like a book. I don't like being around that and I'm often the butt of jokes whenever this happens to and I'm with them. I usually eventually just slip out of the girls friendship because I distance myself from the chaos of the poor girl having to choose which guy she wants to hang out alone with this time. I don't want to wait in line for a friendship... I most certainly don't want to fight for attention either......   \*sigh\* Sucks because I've met some really really awesome girls to, but they usually have jack ass guy friends that just flirt with them the whole time...

That perfectly imperfect body generates enough heat, maybe not enough to satisfy you, but enough to get me through the night. Or morning, afternoon, you know. Maybe I'd kiss my way up that tanned back, up and over your shoulder, and just about the time I'd really start to tease and nibble that earlobe, let my tongue do a little light work...hmmmmm. By the time my hand had made it's way into not-so-virgin territory, and found that moist cleft warm and waiting...you'd have me in hand as well, drawing me in, demanding, not as patient as I. Eh, it's just cause I'm a little older, trust. I always want you just as much.

Or maybe it ain't even like that today. Maybe we've got something planned. Mountains? Brunch somewhere new, Sunday fun day? Or maybe nothing at all. Those days are great too. I'll figure it for us, I always do. Maybe this is one of those heartbreakingly rare days where we are just happy to be alive together, waking up in each others' arms. I love you. And maybe I said it first, and too fast, but fuck, man. It's not like I'm some creep or weirdo who said it after 4 dates. We'd been ""best friends"" for what, almost 18 months? Friends before that? We knew. I knew. You did too, even if you were more concerned about appearances, and forms' sake. Like I said before, I'm older. Shit happens. Happiness is fleeting. Life is short, and can be snatched away at any moment. I ain't got time like that to waste. But aside from that happy crap, we're warm and fuzzy. Sunlight has made my room nice and bright, our sun-kissed skin looks delectable against the backdrop of white sheets and this comforter. You'll put your head on my chest, I'll cradle you in, and tuck your pretty hair back over your ear. I love that fucking hair, even if it is like a sentient being that just invades every inch of space you've been in. Leaving reminders. I'll kiss your forehead. Maybe just the once. Maybe 5 or 6 times in a row, and you'll giggle, and your smile, your hot breath giving me goosebumps when it tickles a little. Your eyes will close, but mine will be wide open as I look up at the ceiling, at nothing in particular. A big grin stretching from ear to ear, which you can't see, but you can feel. How the FUCK am I so lucky. How has this broken, calloused, old beat-to-shit heart of mine finally gotten a break, and something that by now, I don't fucking care to say it - I deserve. How did...awwwwwww. Aw fuck, man. My goddamn fucking phone. Always fucking something. I can't even get 5 minutes of make-believe. No time to set adrift on memory bliss of you, speaking of older. Because this is my life. My shitty, hard, cold, thankless fucking facsimile of a life. Which is why I say dumb stuff like this that makes you and others laugh, but it's not really a fucking joke, not at all.

1209,Stephen_Nemeth,1592457571,1,"Just about 25 minutes ago I turned 20. Hooray just about 1/4 of the way through life, no longer a teenager. And how did I celebrate this? By crying in my bed alone.

 Just before it turned midnight I thought about what would it look like in another 20 years. I would be 40 and I envisioned what I want that birthday to be like. I imagined waking up to gleeful ""Happy Birthday"" from my wife and kids and a whole day just for me and my family. That was my definition of success and happiness, having a family. I didn't care about what job I had, what car I drove, what house I lived in, or any of those material things. It all seemed perfect, but then I remembered this is what I want it to look like. What did I see when I envisioned what it will probably look like? The same thing as now, laying in my bed alone at midnight thinking about what it would look like in 40 years. I would be 80 and probably in some crappy retirement home surrounded by a bunch of staff who probably don't care about me, and that's if I'm still alive. There is a good possibility that I'm in a box in the ground by them, with no one to remember me. In this envisioning, I saw myself dying in a hospital bed alone and forgotten, leaving behind no legacy with no meaningful impact on anyone, no one to feel sad for me, or feel that my death meant something. Just a complete end to existence.

All of this was too much for me and I slowly moved to tears just about at midnight. This turned into anger and frustration, slamming my fists on my desk and throwing things across the room. Angry and frustrated only at me, because I am what's preventing myself from any sort of happiness in the future.

Now I'm a very anti social person, never dated, and have not  had a meaningful friend in a very long time. This might sound weird considering what I what my life to look like, but I use to be the social butterfly until middle and high school. All of my ""friends"" at the time were getting taller and more muscular, while stayed the short and scrawny kid. They all were more interested in girls and social status, while I was interested in school, video games, comics, TV/movies. I was constantly made fun of and at times bullied for being the nerd. So this naturally led me to be outside of any social circle as I would be made fun of if I tried to enter one. Quickly I became the quiet kid who sat in the back of the class. I started to build wall after wall around myself to protect my identity from ridicule and embarrassment. And I was pretty damn good at building these walls never letting anyone in, so much so that I don't know how to tear them down.

I have been so isolated and comfortable in my little fortress I created I am now afraid to talk to anyone and step outside of my bubble, as anytime I go out in public I imagine people are just constantly judging me and looking down at me just like they use to. Even when I do talk to some one it's not pretty. I fidget, don't make eye contact, voice cracks, studders, I just look nervous and uncomfortable and I make people nervous and uncomfortable. The only people that I can talk to normally are my parents and brother. Even then Im not good at picking up social ques and can quickly turn the conversation in a wrong direction and annoy them.

I simply hate that I made a bunch of decisions that isolate myself. College is completely 100% online, job is online, and quarantine hasn't made anything better with everything being fucking online. I don't think I have spoken to someone my age since I graduated high school. I have not had a conversation with a friend since I was a freshman in high school.

Now you want to hear where it gets really pathetic. I literally create people in my mind to talk to. I will basically construct a person in my mind talk to them, and then make them say what I would want them to. I've done this when I'm sad, when I receive exciting news, when I'm watching the news. I've even had ""dates"" with them or how I would imagine a date would go. Usually all of this goes on in my head, but every once in a while I'll find myself talking to them out loud. I've manage to convince myself that these people I made in my mind are real. The other bad part of this is that I like it (well a part of me does, the other part is complaining about it) because it FEELS real. I'm 20 goddamn years old and have fucking imaginary friends.

All of this because I wanted to stick my nerd identity. I wish that I just gave in a became a normal kid when I had the chance, then I would'nt have built my fortress of solitude or using reddit as a means of fullfilling my lack of social intimacy.",lonely,(Rant) So I just turned 20.....,2020-06-18 15:19:31

1215,AnimaliaMillionaires,1592452794,1,"(posted on an alt account on r/sad and another subreddit I don't remember the name of )

Hi everyone, I'm new to this subreddit, I'm 14, and I just wanna vent. My problems all have some sort of awful history, they're something that occurred because of my shitty choices when I was younger, and now they're unsolvable. They've stacked up so far that it would take years of work to reverse them, and it haunts me everyday. Even though I'm always told I'm young and I have so much ahead of me; I still can't stop thinking about how much time I've wasted. I'm surrounded by more competent, smart, attractive, fit, funny, and motivated kids and I just wish I could start over. I missed the laying down of foundations that could make me an interesting and hard working person, they didn't. They were smart and happy and were able to do things without thinking. They found stuff fun, or interesting, they knew how to make life something they were in control of. I've never felt this way.

I listen to this podcast called ""This American Life"", you've probably heard of it, it's very popular. They made this episode called ""Embiggening"", and the second story really stuck with me. It was this woman named Karla Cornejo Villavicencio reading an essay from her book. She was the first undocumented immigrant to graduate Harvard, and overall is just incredibly smart. A lot of the essay focused on her experiences as a child, and it made me really really sad. Even though the essay focused on how horrible her life was as an immigrant child living in America, she was just so competent. She seemed so interesting, and accomplished, and motivated. I felt like there were children around the world who were like this, real fucking geniuses, and I'll just never be one of them. I don't have any of those traits. I'm lazy. I'm not charming. I'm just not important at all. I feel so fucked over by myself, I could've been something. But I'm not.

Continuing my struggles with importance, I've been cutting myself for three years. I used to hide it all the time, I would only wear sweaters even in burning heat, and my family didn't really think much of it. Recently, I've given up on this dedication to furtiveness. I wear short sleeve t-shirts and my scars are visible. They're either a light red or a bleached white if they heal well, either way, they stick out. My family hasn't talked about it with me. I know they know. They know I know they know. They still won't talk to me. I feel like in my life I've had to fight for attention, people around me got it easily, I never felt like I did. My family, to be more specific my mother, really loved me. She watched me and cared for me and all that, but I never felt like she was someone who really really wanted me. I have a weird mix of feelings towards my mom. I love her, I go on walks with her and we talk about my issues, but still it feels to me like she isn't willing to spare enough time to face me about my self harm. It feels like everyone around me quietly agreed in their heads that I'm just not special enough to be worth it. The really fucked up part is that I've believed ""I'm not worth it"" my entire life, they affirm it to me everyday.

I'm going into high-school after this summer for visual arts. I've wanted to go to this school for over 4 years, I got in. I'm excited but I'm terrified. I know I won't be able to keep up with the talent around me, I know I won't rise to the occasion and flourish, I'll stay sitting in my little dark corner and fail over, and over, and over again. I've attempted it in the past, but I think I'm going to really try to commit suicide.

Ive always been proud of my ability to think. When i was just a teenager i would bank on this ability to convince myself and everyone around me that i was worth their time. Slowly but surely, this pride would fade, and the superficial confidence i wore to conceal the abyss within myself would give way to a more profound sense of emptiness than I had ever felt before. Everything since then has just been me trying to outrun insecurities that stem from this emptiness. I would struggle to define or identify with myself, and would find people who had more concrete problems and insecurities than I did. In solving these problems I would 'force' these people into a situation where they would value me and validate me, and with some warmth restored to my core I would fall asleep, grateful that i had gotten through another day, dreading the morning that was to come.

I wished for few months to get text ""what's up?"" ""what are you doing?"" ""what's on your mind?""

And now...

I just want to be leaved alone,theoreticaly I can meet with someone...

But what's the point?

I don't feel comfortable around anyone,or anyone truthfully give a shit.

I'm sitting in empty room,writing some dumb shit with no plans for future farther than 3 months (I'm quite young).

I'm just sitting between nothing,felling hole in my soul with dumb shit that I'm paying 100‚Ç¨ every month.

I am going through a divorce, we were together for 7 years and for about 5 he was someone i could share my real self with. Now my friend of 10 years doesnt want to see or talk to me because in highschool we had sex a few times and he has a girlfriend now. 

I cant talk to my family because its all ""i told you so""  or ""you should (insert something unhelpful here)"" and my dad is the worst all he cares about is me finding a new job when covid is hitting my town finally. I have a child and am on umempoyment after working for 11 years without much down time. 

I have started an new relationship but anytime i bring up my pain from my last relationship or start talking about my divorce at all he gets unresponsive or flat out says he doesnt want to hear about it. I get that he has in own baggage but i need someone to hear me. 

Before beginning my divorce i had constant thoughts of ending my life, but i have my child and with her dad is no way to grow up. Even now the thought finds me.

I never defended myself from them or anyone who attacked me, since my mother is a very strict feminist and always told me she‚Äôd kill me if I ever touched a girl, even to defend myself. During the last couple of years I‚Äôve been getting more attracting and fit, so some girls contacted me over social medias asking me to send them nudes and sending me provoking pictures. A year ago, a girl texted me saying she wasn‚Äôt feeling good in her life and wanted someone to talk to, so I stupidly accepted, we started talking about depression, I talked about how I went through it and even attempted suicide at some point. She kept asking about me and said she was very lonely, she sent a picture of herself (obviously not herself) and told me to send her a picture of me, which I stupidly sent her. Then she started saying I looked attractive and stuff and said she started touching herself and wanted me to touch myself too. She sent me a couple of videos of her touching herself, so I ended up responding with videos of me, for which she threatened to blackmail me (even though she asked for them repeatedly). I blocked her, deleted any social media account and went completely offline. I was already very hesitant about girls back then, but since that episode I‚Äôm completely terrified and can‚Äôt even look at girls anymore, since I‚Äôm scared they may abuse me or put me in trouble.

1278,alan13446,1592398493,1,"Regardless of why you are lonely, most people have had some stability in their home lives as far as growing up in the same community, town, city, state, country.

There are the other unfortunate kids. Like me. (I'm 62), I attended 15 schools in four countries by the time I started grade 9, thanks to narcissistic, selfish and ignorant parents who married too young and never should have had a child. My dad was in jail for embezzlement when I was born. He was 23. My mom, a prostitute, had a string of abortions before me and one more would have killed her. They divorced when I was 6. My dad moved to another country, my mom simply abandoned me.

They then played tennis with me, me being the ball. Back and forth for several years in several countries as they kept moving with their new lives and neither wanted me. School after school, boarding schools even time in a Roman Catholic orphanage when I was pretty much abandoned in a foreign country for nearly a year. 8 years old, I learned to cry under the blankets in silence. The only comfort I had was a small stuffed seal given to me by a case worker. That, and a small battery operated  emerald green tavern lantern about 1"" cubed. That green light, under the blanket, was my comfort. To this day, 54 years later, my bedroom still has a green night light, and my clock radio's have always been green LED's. But I digress.

All these schools and countries and languages and new kids, I no longer had the willpower to integrate or say anything. Start,do homework, get beaten up by bullies, move on to the next school. And yes, all that change and moving and new schools and new people and new languages and having to explain who you are over and over again and defend yourself to a new set of bullies and mouthy dickheads does fuck you up for life. Walls were built, heart grew cold, social skills chipped away, retreated into a safe cocoon of self isolation to deal with the endless transfers and relocations. But still had a positive enthusiastic ambitious attitude, good humour, intelligence and a massive people pleaser. (Buying friendship).

Today, almost no friends, almost no family except my two sons, can't keep relationships going because I'm ""different"" . No one cuts me any slack or shows any compassion or understanding. The loneliness, especially at this age, is horrible but not surprising, as it's been my life in one form or another since birth. 

Finished school, got a good career, worked for some of Canada's biggest and best companies as an engineer. Set foot in 30 countries, no issues with drugs or law or alcohol. My ex wife of 25 years, small town farmers daughter, lived an amazing rich life thanks to me and never had it so good. But she never had my back because I was ""different"". Her redneck family never accepted me. And 25 years is a long time. They can't specifically point to one thing wrong with me. They just hated me because I was smarter, had seen and done more, and - and this is the best part - I didn't wear black clothes or flannel shirts, didn't drive a pickup truck, or speak like I had caramel covered marbles in my mouth. We didn't have many friends because now I understand the ex wife suffered from Social Anxiety and had acquired her family's anti-social behaviour. She only stuck around for 25 years because I was her meal ticket. Once she didn't need me anymore, she fucked off. Our last 2 years together, she was cheating on me. I was blind to it at the time. But that's another story.

Three failed relationships since that marriage ended 13 years ago. Each lady latched on immediately, thanking her gods and stars above that she finally found the man of her dreams. Together, we travelled overseas, and down south and all places in between. I made them laugh and fed them amazing tasty dishes I cooked with love. They had a calm fun life, were loved, respected, made to feel good. Essentially, I gave them absolutely zero to complain about. Each one would post pictures of us on social media, and had their girlfriends reply, ""OMG, you're so lucky, I'm so jealous!! Does he have a brother?"" Yet, after 2 - 3 years, each one became unhappy, left, and downgraded. Downgraded meaning, they chose to be with a man who doesn't go anywhere, can't cook more than bacon or KD, knows nothing outside sports and fishing, speaks with that throaty sticky mouth voice, but most importantly, FITS IN! Now, all three ex's have a man who is essentially the clone of the men their girlfriends are with. And they all sit around the bonfire and talk jibberish about nothing. 

My last relationship, we were engaged. She was a petite woman who also had a difficult childhood, smart, lived overseas, travelling dad. We had that in common and instantly bonded over 3 years ago. She was on welfare living in subsidized housing, in debt, took a dozen meds each day to combat her diabetes, pains, mental and physical issues. She spent 4 - 5 days a week at my house, moved in most of her clothing and decorated my place. A year later we were engaged. Went overseas 3 times on my dime. But shortly after the engagement, she changed. She left in March last year for reasons I wasn't aware of. Returned in November, only to leave me just before Christmas. Broke up via email. Turns out, there was another man she had met and fallen for three years before she met me. He wasn't available then. When with me, she had blossomed, a beauty came out. Confidence and radiant smile. he resurfaced and she began to see him behind my back, and left me for him. Then they had a falling out in the fall, so she returned in November with the engagement ring back on her finger, telling me what I wanted to hear. It worked, he got jealous, and committed to her. So she fucked off right before Christmas and now they live together. His house is off the main highway not too far from where i live and I see her new car in his spacious property all the time. He fits in. He looks and dresses and talks the part. She doesn't have to be embarrassed now by having a man who is better, smarter and more helpful and loving and caring than her girlfriends. 

A month after she blindsided me and left me, my dad died. I had to scramble to the country he was living in and in 4 days, close off his life, arrange and bury him, then return to an empty house, no one to console or hold me or be there for me.

I'll be 62 in 2 months. Still working with a good career in software security,  still good looking and fit, own my home, no debt, but still dying of loneliness. Dating is off the books now thanks to COVID. But i don't see the point of starting a new relationship anymore. The last 4, including my marriage, have proven that people are scared and uncomfortable with anyone who speaks outside their secure cocoon. I don't fit in. Never have. I've been looking after me since nearly birth, and still managed to make it this far without giving up or descending down the path of drugs and alcohol and financial debt.

The women from my past? They love to sit around and bash their men, trying to out do each other with what an unreliable loser he is. Then they look at my partner who looks at her feet and says, ""I got nothing to complain about"". So my partner gets shunned and ostracized. So they resent me for the great, rich and drama free (but different) life I've shown them, and break up with me. Then they find Mike Towtruck, Joe Welder or Kevin Carpenter and settle into mundane. Now at the weekly wine spritzer socials, she too has something to contribute, and is back in the herd.

It's like Survivor. You have to fit in, talk the talk of mundane bullshit. Otherwise, you get voted off.  People are scared of anyone who is the slightest different than the tiny world they live in. And for some of us, we watch from the outside, forever lonely.",lonely,Life is like being on Survivor.,2020-06-17 22:54:53

^((DO NOT COMMENT OR PM ME, PLEASE, JUST LIKE SO I‚ÄôD KNOW SOMEONE HAS LISTENED TO ME))

I am the typical quiet kid in the class, the one who doesn‚Äôt talk, the one who hates group activities because I know I‚Äôve got nobody to group myself with, the one who look for a quiet place where not many people go to during vacant periods because it gives me the feeling of security, that no one can see what I‚Äôm doing. I don‚Äôt like being the center of attention, it gives me anxiety that I wouldn‚Äôt say the right words so I just sit and listen to others. I get crazy stressed whenever I speak, like everyone is judging me, that no one is listening, that none of what I say matter, at all. Even on one on one conversation, I don‚Äôt think no one is interested in what I‚Äôm saying, that‚Äôs when I stop speaking and just stare at my phone, pretending someone texted or a notification popped up, like nothing happened. I‚Äôve wanted to tell my story to my friends, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd care. I only talk when truly necessary.

Why no comment or PM? Because I‚Äôll get overly stressed replying, I don‚Äôt know the words to say and it‚Äôs kind of rude not to reply, and I can‚Äôt hold a fucking conversation. So I think it‚Äôs better to just remove that bit. 

Due to the pandemic I had to go back to my parents‚Äô for a few reasons:

¬∑ For financial stuff, they‚Äôd spend less on me when I‚Äôm home.

¬∑ They won‚Äôt get stressed if I got the virus or not.

¬∑ My brother wouldn‚Äôt use it against me (he‚Äôs a fucking pain in the ass).

I‚Äôd like to give the least problems to everyone as much as I can. I thought this could lessen the family drama (I hate drama) \*every time my brother and I go home, there is bound to be a drama\*. I thought I was right, I thought for once there would be no drama, but just a week or two in, drama managed to come up. Basically, my brother needed some medical attention and he needs to go to the hospital, I was the only one at home with a driver‚Äôs license, my brother already asked to drive him, but my mother just looked at me, as if I can‚Äôt drive or something and continued to contact drivers to drive him, I locked myself in my room after that. Then later in the day, she was knocking on my door and asked me to drive him, I didn‚Äôt answer, I was full of emotion them and was not fit to drive. I never knew who drive him to where ever. My parents have always told me when I was a kid not to answer them, maybe that stuck with me. I‚Äôve learned that shutting up would lead me to less trouble, maybe I‚Äôve adapted that as my defense mechanism. 

A few days after that stuff, my brother knocked for some reason I forgot, he was angry for some reason, he was shouting and pounding my door, I locked myself in my room for days after that.

When everything was cooled down, I was ready to speak, it was during dinner, my brother was saying some business stuff that doesn‚Äôt really matter, when he asked me the possibility of this and that I replied ‚Äúdo you want to know why I am not talking‚Äù (since that event, I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone, it was a few weeks already that point). He replied ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the topic‚Äù, I mean he‚Äôs right, it wasn‚Äôt, It‚Äôs just me, not talking, just nodding and shaking my head or typing on my phone when asked, yeah, business stuff is more important than me, I see it. My mother was also there and said nothing, after that I didn‚Äôt try to speak again, up to now. I don‚Äôt matter is what I‚Äôve concluded, what I think doesn‚Äôt matter, my words doesn‚Äôt matter.",lonely,‚ÄúNO ONE IS LISTENING‚Äù,2020-06-17 22:48:50

I'm Nate, I'm 34 years old and have recently been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, Scheuermann's Disease, Kyphoscoliosis with onset scoliosis, Arthritis of the spine, have rheumatoid Arthritis in my right ankle and left wrist. I have been told that I require some pretty major spinal surgery and am waiting to be placed on a waiting list for said surgery (3 year minimum waiting list) and this pandemic has slowed all progress with this to a holt, I may not actually be ""fixed"" until I am in my 40s (worst case scenario) 
All this happened after being misdiagnosed by a ""specialist"" when I was 14. I have tried physios, chiropractors, sports massage, you name it, I've tried it...yet the pain persists.
As well as all this, back in 2012, one of my ""best friends"" turned out to be a pathological liar and literally (within a week) had systematically turned all my friends against me and I have literally had only 2 friends since and just found out that one of them is moving to the other side of the country in 2 months and the other is well on their way to that white picket fence and children with his partner.
I managed to find myself a girl in 2015 but that ended up with me being trapped in a mentally and physically abusive relationship for 2 and a half years. So I have insane trust issues. I feel like I have been through many layers of proverbial hell and recently it has really been testing my mental health..being plagued with such questions as: -How do you make friends in your mid 30s? -Who would ever be interested in someone with so many problems/ailments? -Is there really any point?

This is my worst fear, just growing old, being alone and in constant pain. 

Sorry if this just comes across as hopeless or pathetic...I am just stsrtikg tonfeel overwhelming despair and I cannot seem to shake it.

Any advice or conversation would be appreciated.

My mother and father still go to the church that is led by the pastor that covered up their rapes and whose children have preyed on the church children.Whats worse is my nephews and nieces are exposed at this church to their aunts rapist and due to some sick belief in god their parents think its norma.I found someone who was starting to fall for me after i fell for her but someone decided to falsely accuse me of being a child  predator for some reason and started to spread the rumor but its not true due to the fact that i was victimized myself by an older woman when i was young i wont go into detail but the choice was die on the streets that winter or go home with her due to these experiences and a few more i wont post  i could never harm anyone woman or child  in that manner i was actually stabbed for stopping a rape before.well now the few friends i had stopped talking to me .Some conversations i had that where private where taken out of context and used to misrepresent me along with those false accusations.I have had to do many things i'm not proud of to survive.But the honest truth is that all i've ever wanted was to help others.I want to be a doctor and help heal others.I like poetry and art philosophy.I don't drink or do drugs because i believe that every moment is precious that people have the capacity for greatness To be honest i want to love and be loved to have a somewhere safe to sleep where people wont hurt me for just existing i cant imagine a place where i'm safe or not wondering where my next meal will come from every moment that passes is difficult because the world views me as a monster and in many ways i hurt because of its view and  treatment of me.The truth is that home is something ill never know being loved is unimaginable not being surrounded by monsters is so foreign everybody around me has been a monster but to be honest the worst monsters are normal people because even theo i survive in alleys i can understand why the people out here try to hurt me its a fight for resources whether it be food money or drugs.However people in conventional society they make false accusations or hunt me like an animal because i'm homeless they actually stabbed me for fun.Its difficult because i just want to go home i just want to be safe i just want to be not hungry i just want her to be there and to hold my hand all  i know is i'm running to the military in search of a better life.The truth is i'm likely going to die far away from this place surrounded by strangers and it'll be the closes to a home i'll have ever known i don't know why i'm typing this i don't think it will change anything if your reading this theo know this we most likely will never meet, hold each other,  or laugh together but  i sincerely hope that you find home even if i never do.",lonely,I Just want to go home,2020-06-17 19:09:13

Now I'm back to being on my own, which I didn't think anything was wrong with it. I thought I had my friends to talk to. One of their birthdays was yesterday so I had told him I'd take him out to celebrate sometime this week(family time first), he opens the message and goes unresponsive. It hasn't been him either.

1290,2ii2ky,1592381166,1,"Every so often, I'll think to myself ""Jesus, this is the loneliest I've ever been."" And then it gets worse.

I took the company of many people for granted. People I would give anything to have back in my life. I thought I was a friendless loser before, back when I had a friend group I actively participated in and spoke to. Now I literally have nobody. It's kind of strange to genuinely have no friends. There's nobody to talk to. Nobody to laugh with. Whenever I see a funny meme I send it to my sister, who is the closest thing to a friend I have.

I do have people I speak to on occasion. People I care about. But people who wouldn't blink twice if I never texted them again. People who blatantly consider me nothing more than an acquaintance. And I do try to further my relationship with these people, but it never works.

My love life is equally fruitless. I was left by my long-term partner around 9 months ago, and have had no luck whatsoever in that arena since then. I realize that may not seem like a very long time to be single, but when you have nobody as a source of affection or emotional support, it gets kind of draining to be so alone and unwanted.

I've always struggled with feeling undesirable. Ugly. Gross. And now I guess it's confirmed, since nobody is interested in me. I'm signed up for 5 or 6 different dating sites, none of which have brought even a semblance of success. Meeting new people is increasingly difficult in a digital age. I take classes online, and don't really leave the house much outside of that, so I don't really have any way to meet new people. I've tried to find social activities around me (clubs, meetings, volunteer opportunities) but haven't found anything. I try to make friends online, joining Discord servers pertaining to my interests and things of that nature, but people usually ignore/tolerate me and don't find me particularly appealing.

I have friends, but I haven't seen any of them in person since early this year. And I suck at keeping in touch with a lot of them. Those that I do message on a regular basis are probably tired of me leaning on them when I feel down, which is pretty fucking often these days.

I have my family, but for whatever reason its very hard for me to relate to them and I can only hang out with them for minutes at a time before I have to retreat to my room. I'm in my early 30's and I had to move back in with them because of financial difficulties. But I guess it's just as well, I would probably feel even emptier living alone.

I guess I come browse these subs looking for some sort of kindred spirit that I can somehow bond with better than the people in my life, but that's kind of a pipe dream. I've tried talking to people on here and it never gets very far because, truth be told, I just don't know what to say to you. And that's my fault. I guess what I want is to skip past the awkward basic questions and just have someone tell me about their life and vice versa. But I don't think people are usually comfortable with that. So I don't know if these subs are even where I should be looking for whatever I'm looking for.

I guess the reason I say I ""wasted my night"" is because (without getting too specific) there are clear steps I could be taking in my life right now to get myself back on track. But instead I procrastinate and browse subs like this because the emptiness is very distracting for me and I just want to experience some real human fucking connection for once.

When I was younger, I had a close friend who was a tomboy looking back in retrospect, and we both shared common interests of listening to heavy metal, drinking energy drinks together, getting into tricking (sub-genre of flipping, acrobatic stunts, etc.) however as we both grew older, her friends dictated and reshaped her interests, and thus our friendship drifted apart.

Currently, we are both in high school, so you could tell that I‚Äôm not too old, however, as my interests are generally uncommon, I lost most connections with any ties from the past.

1314,unashamedandashamed1,1592367416,1,"I made a fantastic discovery about myself earlier this year. I'm an extrovert. I always thought I was an introvert but I started to realize it wasn't the people that caused me to feel drained after going out, it was the environments! Of course loud places where I couldn't focus made me feel drained. Armed with this information I slowly started to reorder my life. I started going out more but in smaller groups and you know what? I was happier. I had been making myself unhappy for so long because I was trying to meet needs that I didn't have at the expense of needs that I did!

But all that changed when the fire nation covid attacked.

I'm high risk so I have been very private. I started to keep to myself about amonth before everyone else and now people are starting to go back out (despite numbers where I live being higher than ever). In the process I ended up moving back in with some family ( HELLO stress) and I haven't seen any of my friends in person in months.

So thats where you come in! Surely I can't be the only one? The only person stuck at home with way to much free time and a growing sense of lonlienss! Lets get to know each other, chat, have real conversations. Lets watch tv together or something.

Things to know:

1) I hate texting due to some hand problems. So I primary want to voice chat though of course we can text some while we mutually make sure the other person is SOMEWHAT sane.

2)I'm a pretty damn good conversationalist but I won't carry the whole thing. You gotta be willing to meet me in the middle and make an effort! No good friendships can be onesided

3)Ive got a TON of free time right now as I finish up college and job hunt. So...yeah. I'm almost always available lol.

4) Since I want to eventually voice chat you need to be willing to EVENTUALLY move to another app.

5) Ive got dad humor for days. I love puns and I'm sure you will hear some of them!

1322,zklx,1592363695,1,"In general I've always been fairly lonely, right the way through primary school until now. School and work have usually made up for the slack so I've been putting my joke of a social life on the back burner and have not paying much attention.

However, after 15 weeks of isolation, having being suddenly chucked out of school and work and knowing that I don't have school to fall back on for socialising as I'm in my last year, it's starting to take its toll. I now realise just how lonely I am.

The last close friend I had I lost in 2018, we talked about everything 15 yr olds would talk about. Though her situation was dire towards the end and she leaned on me for support as I would listen, however I wasn't quite ready to take on that kind of responsibility. I helped her through her breakup, gave her a place to stay when she was chucked out of her place, and helped her deal with the aftermath of being sexually abused. That took a considerable toll on my mental wellness. I began self-harming and making decisions I would never normally make, and I didn't quite know why. She ended up going to live with family in England, and we never really got in contact much after that.

All of that had a knock-on effect on the rest of my social circle, and within a few months my social life had declined to the nothing it is now. It's that bad I know the exact dates of when I last hugged someone who wasn't family, and the last social gathering I attended.

June 26th 2018 @ ~10:45am, and July 18th 2019 respectively.

I can even describe in detail what happened on those days, obviously I'm not going to though..

(god I sound like an incel)

I've taken to having little artificial conversations with imaginary friends as if I'm schizophrenic. If it wasn't for staying with family I probably wouldn't be here today, that sliver of human interaction has kept be sane.

I won't lie in saying I've been having an existential crisis of sorts. If no one's there then who would care if I just kinda subtly left this dreadful mortal plain? There's a lovely wood close to where I live, and it has a path that goes right by a waterfall, about 50ish meters above the splashpool with some jagged rocks down there too. What if I were to just, fall off.. (Just to clarify I'm not at the point where I'm seriously considering it, it's just an occuring thought) My optimism is keeping me here. I tell myself, ""I'm only 17, 1/5th the way through my life, there's a lot more to it so why waste it?"". 

I just want to feel wanted by someone. I want to feel the warm embrace that is a hug. To put it simply, I need purpose.

during my alone time, i self reflected, got help, and improved (creating boundaries to prevent abuse in relationships helped as well).

the only people i managed to successfully connect with are the ‚Äúweirdos‚Äù or outcasts of society. don‚Äôt get me wrong, some people say i‚Äôm ‚Äúcool‚Äù and kind and sometimes random strangers would come up to me telling me their life stories or coworkers would trust me enough to vent about troubles in their lives which is a step in the right direction. before quarantine, a few of us were actually very excited about hanging out!

i‚Äôm gonna be honest, i did push some people away to prevent getting hurt but i‚Äôm learning to trust more and more each day. i just wish i fostered enough friendships before lockdown :/

I‚Äôve always been an outcast, with little or no friends. I‚Äôve moved around my whole life from Illinois to Texas to California and traveled all over the US. I‚Äôve had a lot of experiences. Really bad and kinda bad. To super weird and super fucked up. 

I‚Äôm not sure when I started noticing it, but my whole childhood was terrible. Heavily alcoholic mother and father, never stable. Always fighting. 

I‚Äôve almost been killed numerous times. Once there was a guy who chased me into me and my friends car and tried opening the doors to get to us. In 2011 I was hit by a drunk driver that almost killed me. Fractured ribs, sternum, lower spine, bleeding brain, fracture on the skull. And some more stuff I don‚Äôt remember.

I ended up meeting a guy from tinder. We ended up dating for two years. But after a month,he told me he was an ex heroin user. And told me the most awful stories of shit he‚Äôs done. Three months later he relapsed. Ended up overdosing and dying for a min or two. He was acting weird and I guess he blacked out from taking pain pills and alcohol together. Then decided to go use. While I was with him, he started giving me this liquid anxiety medicine to help with my anxiety. But it was experimental and I had major memory loss. I don‚Äôt remember a whole lot of four months. Then we went to Galveston and he gave me the meds. I blacked out and totaled my car. I delt with that for two years. Until he left me a few months ago. And recently, he told me he overdosed again and almost died.

Without skin to skin contact and physical affection, the human brain begins to degrade, losing the ability to process large amounts of information and beginning to shut down even when performing the simplest of tasks (like retrieving drink from the fridge) resulting in motor control failures and spills.

All these things have to be true because I'm going through them. I can't be the ONLY person going through them, and I can't be the only person in my geographical area who goes through them, because the odds are one in 7.6 billion and that's some bullshit.

I haven't had proper cuddles in years and it shows. My temper flares without warning or provocation, my moods have become bipolar and borderline unmanageable without cannabis, and my desire/need for total control over every aspect of every video game I play has increased 100fold.

I am quiet, shy, socially anxious, and very introverted.

I overthink every situation and can barely get a word out of my mouth.

Now at this school i‚Äôm at, I have these two friends, who i would regard as my best friends but i‚Äôm not sure they might feel the same way. They each have their own friend groups outside of us and they‚Äôre closer to eachother than with me and it‚Äôs just a feeling of exclusion really.

1388,cassie_to_heart,1592306971,1," It's been mentally exhausting and tiring to look for high-quality friendships here on reddit. Am I supposed to consign myself to being lonely and alone, no reliable friends as a 21 yo Mtf trans (who is pre HRT and not yet transition yet)? Am I supposed to keep hanging on for the notion that ""there's always somebody for everyone out there"" and ""chin up""? I'm settling on friendships because it is somewhat more feasible than any hope of a relationship, and the latter alone would be more preferable in that people don't have to have high hopes for me to be their match

I've been greatly discouraged to post in many friendship-oriented subs (e.g. Make a friend, need a friend) after being met with comments from guys expressing their anti- sentiments towards my interests/hobbies in law enforcement/military let alone, connect with one receptive to mine? I've seen people with specific interests/hobbies not get as much upvotes compared to people who make low-effort posts but are as general in that they say: Love to laugh, share memes, into astrology, psychology, INFP/ENFP. It makes me puzzled and stumped on what to say to get more support and attention when I post. I resent that it's from my fellow gals that make it seem easy to make male friends. 

I even get asked intrusive questions like ""Do you have breasts?"" or go towards those freaky deaky line of questioning. Others more obnoxious when they feel entitled for me to vent to them... saying that they're a friend and trying to connect with me, I should be appreciative (Lol they gotta earn that friendship). There's also the ones who simply message ""Hey/Hi/Hello"" which are a lot of them. 

I want someone to tell me the proverbial bs that having hope in finding friendships is worth it (/s), I am this close to giving up. It's easy for them to say when they struck gold... but hey, people like to read positive stories and anything that gives them some measure of hope. No one likes to acknowledge the unspoken reality of people being so unlucky... being so crippling lonely, take it from someone who ends up crying most nights before going to sleep because she can't connect with anyone. Certainly not people in my local area... they'd give strange looks when I tell what I'm interested in, not some of my university colleagues...seeking friendships online is the only way for me.

Gosh, I sound like someone who was in the military having trouble re-integrating into the civilian world. I feel like I could only connect to guys and people in those professions... background, experiences, outlook in life... career even. How the frack do I make people interested when I share that one of my interests is to listen police scanners and learn trivial things like Chicago PD officers are terrible at making sure their radios aren't on open mic... with dispatch reminding them often to watch their keys? That the 2008 US Army standard issue of the Vomelette MRE was as palatable as dogs vomit. Or watching videos of cop-roleplay videos in GTA V LSPDFR, where doing the process of paperwork and responding to call-outs seem appealing to me.... 

I'm not the perfect girl or girl-to-be interested in anime, Animal crossing etc. for many guys. My interests/hobbies are what I built up, and they mean a lot to me, from a time where I had none. I want to feel like it matters somehow... to me. It's not a waste of time that I mustered up my interests. 

So for people out there, what could they possible tell me that will make it easier to form connections? Go on Meetup, go to social clubs etc... as if they're are any that are receptive to my interests, they're so specific I doubt many people can understand me. 

I don't want to stick myself in the pit full of other lonely people, I don't want a daily reminder of what it's like to have no connections whatsoever from anyone. Why aren't I allowed to chase something that I want... under my own terms and no-one to undermine that in any fashion?

On some tangential note, I am also feeling down with the current state of affairs (strangely not the pandemic) but with the protests going on, I've read a news article about a cop from LVPD (Las Vegas PD) who was shot in the head by a careless vigilante-to-be two weeks ago, who ""miraculously"" lived but caveat that he's paralyzed from the neck down, unable to speak and on a ventilator... perhaps permanently. A man being robbed of his livelihood, ambition and happiness. An undeserved price to pay in terms of what's going on, with it being hard on both sides. It was news which I was actively attuned to, wouldn't lie in that it felt like it was irrationally eating away at me for a couple of days now. Made me think on the outlook of life. People say there's more to life. It's not too late.... yeah, hard to think what is there to look forward to when your life is reduced to being feed purees by family for the rest of your life and muscles atrophying. I'm generally pessimistic so it doesn't help.

Y'know the humorous bit? I'm studying Nursing so as a student nurse, it's sometimes hard knowing the prospective patients you might encounter. Oh, and people expect nurses to be sociable. I certainly don't fit the fracking bill.

1389,jennyabraham21,1592305032,1,"When it comes to finding true friends, you have to put the work in.

Good friends whom you really connect with, who inspire, uplift and support you, won't just magically materialise on your doorstep - you need to be willing to take initiative.

But equally, forming strong, meaningful friendships doesn‚Äôt have to be difficult.

Here‚Äôs what I have learnt on my journey to make new real, genuine friends‚Ä¶

# Step 1. Meet New People!

**Go to parties/social events.** One of the easiest ways to meet people is through friends you already have. Tag along to a party or social event and get your friend to make the introductions.

**Join clubs or classes.** Friends are generally people that you share a common interest with, so the people you meet through hobbies or classes are great potential friend material.

**Turn Exercising into a Social Event.** Signing up for a gym membership is a great way to meet people whilst staying fit. Taking an exercise class might help you to find a new workout partner who could easily become a friend outside the gym too!

**Instagram Friends can be IRL Friends too!** Believe it or not, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) can be a great place to meet cool people. Instagram has a great feature which allows you to search by location and hashtags, which will help you find people nearby who share your interests.

**Try an App**\- My personal favourite is [Serendip](https://serendip.co/). Ideal for anyone aged 18-35 looking to connect with new like-minded individuals - it will match you with people whose values align with yours.

**Meet people at work.** If you have a work colleague you feel a connection with, now‚Äôs the time to invite them for a drink or bite to eat after work

**Join Local Facebook Groups**. Joining [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) groups can be an effective way to make friends. Use the search bar at the top of the home page and select ‚Äúgroups‚Äù to narrow down results to your liking. Use your city‚Äôs name in the search to see local results.

# Step 2. Develop a Bond

**Be Authentic**\- Stay true to who you are! This way you‚Äôll be able to form strong, meaningful connections.

**Keep an open mind.** Even if you meet someone who doesn‚Äôt *look* like the kinda person you'd have lots in common with, try chatting to them and give them a chance. They may turn out to be your closest friend!

**Stay in touch.** Be sure to get contact info for the people you meet - whether it's their mobile phone number or a link to their social media pages. Stay connected and show that you're thinking of them.

**Be a Good Listener**\- Be someone they can turn to when they‚Äôre anxious or upset.

**Ask Thoughtful Questions**\- Show them you‚Äôre interested in their life, problems and passions.

**Generosity Goes a Long Way!**\- Giving (whether its a gift, your advice or your time) will never go unappreciated!

**Commit**\- Make sure you consistently put time and effort into pursing your new friendship!",lonely,"How to make real, genuine friendships...",2020-06-16 20:57:12

1391,keagle5544,1592303556,1,"2 months ago I was in depression and terrible anxiety. I had a crush on a girl at school for 5 years and in the end I was convinced that she liked me back. But unfortunately I was wrong and then school ended and now I'll never see her again. A my life I had been an introvert and never told anything to anyone. At that point in my life I felt extremely lonely. I had no one in the world to talk too. I was blaming everything on myself and self depreciating myself. Many nights I used to cry before going to sleep. It was so horrible but eventually I got through. The best thing that I did was to look for help on the Internet. I also read a lot of books during that time on self awareness and self help books. Even though I suck at reading books, it felt really good reading about all of it. I realised that for a person like me will have to be alone for a long time in my life. Even then I didn't really had many friends and my family thought that I was really happy those days. 

         So I looked for specific issues/problems (eg. self esteem , obsession) on the Internet. YouTube really helped me in the end. I realised that having a romantic partner will never solve my problem. I realised that what I really needed was to feel accepted and sense of feeling special which I was seeking in a romantic partner. Actually if I start loving myself and accepting myself I would never need anyone else. But loving yourself needs effort. You need to do things to make yourself proud, no matter how small they are. Also I would recommend some subs like r/selfhelp , r/discipline that really helped me. This sadness and feeling sorry for yourself jas to be replaced by knowledge and awareness. I would also say I made a lot of friends on sites like omegle where I told them my problem a lot of times to different people, and most of the people were supporting there. 

   Some things I learned during this period
    1. Reading self-help books and reading on specific problems on reddit or     quora. It's very important to be specific. Also helps with the loneliness as it feels like you're talking to the authors.

    2. Writing everything on your mind (after some time the pages start writing themselves) 

    3. Realising that in the end no one will be able to pull you out of this until you do something about it. You can't just sit there and hope for things to get better. 
  
     4. It usually feels like nothing excites you anymore and nothing will make you happy, but you need to put in the effort and give your best at making yourself happy by yourself. 
   

5. Self depreciation and talking down on yourself is the worst thing you can do to yourself. It's an easy excuse for all your problems but it never leads to anything and eventually that road leads to self hurting activities.

1395,pi1ott,1592299025,1,"Hi all, throwaway account here.
I'm, as the title states, a lonely .

This is going to be decently long so if you don't wanna read a long bit of sadness/stuff about my life, then stop here - it's fine if you don't want to. I just need to get this off my chest. Also, just want to mention this isn't a rant about my life - I've got a much better life than some other people but I'm just a bit lonely. 

I'm a  in year 11 at high school. I've always had friends but throughout the past couple years I've had to change groups due to a variety of external factors. I'm decent at making friends. I wouldn't say I'm great looking, just good at working with what I've got and a little below average. Anyway, I had a gf back a few years ago, and although it was OK, I rushed into the decision a little bit after hearing she liked me from some other people. That ended a little after about 12 months I think and I made the conscious choice to not get a gf till later on in high school / university. 

So, I got into a bunch of hobbies (electrical DIY, aviation and music are the main ones) and I enjoy most of them even to this day, but it's a very lonely ordeal. Since about year 8, I've been on my own with school work. My parents are great and all, but due to the ram and cram school system, they can't remember much about anything except English - and I'm a mathematically oriented person. Physics, engineering, IT and maths are my main subjects at school and so I've never had help with that kind of thing but I still work my ass off to get decent marks. I stand out a bit due to that (I get ""weird person"" vibes when people hear my reply after asking about my marks). But also my hobbies are lonely since no-one I know knows about or appreciates me talking about them and will almost always try to divert the conversation elsewhere - so I don't bother anymore. 

Most public knowledge of me isn't even 40% of what's happening in my life. I mean yeah, there are things I talk about with the guys at school but there's only one person who knows remotely about any of my emotional side and that's another girl whom I've known since the start of high school but have only just started talking to again. 

On to the shittier bits. 

I wouldn't say people hate me. I pretty much know for a fact that some people dislike me but that's a given for almost anyone. I'm by far not the most popular guy anywhere, and definitely not the most popular to the other gender, but I'm a little shy when it comes to these matters. I just try to not make myself look like too much of a dickhead and dress decently when I can. I am, although, the meme of the group. This is the reason for people not knowing much about my personal side - because when they do, it becomes a bit of a meme/joke which could be brung up again and again as it has been in the past. 

This has become a bit of a habit and I have real trust issues - even with the girl mentioned earlier whom I talk to on a fairly regular basis; on one incident getting angry at her even though I had no proof of her leaking any information (which she didn't, a guy just bluffed that he had information and it was damn believable). I took the hit and we started talking again eventually and are still talking to this day. 

The main point of this post was to get off my chest the lonely feelings that have been pent up over the years and have spilled over today after one of my mates got with a girl in our year. I know and talk to both of them on a regular basis and they are both great people, and I'm happy for them. I'm not jealous in any way of my mate, but I'm just really longing for someone I can actually tell all of my feelings and thoughts to and be able to listen to theirs. I want someone that isn't judgemental and is happy to just sit and talk or have a laugh. So many guys my age are just out for getting laid, which I can understand, but don't completely relate to. I don't want to be another one of those guys and Idk, I think that's why I haven't had much success talking to women? I'm not particularly good at conversation with the opposite gender except for the girl previously mentioned that got with my mate occasionally because we have a similar conversation style - but we're not getting together and I enjoy having her as a friend. 

Man, it's just lonely. I'm starting to lose my passion for maths, physics, music and a little bit for aviation too. Everything I do feels like it's going into a void that doesn't satisfy me anymore and all my days are morphing into one extended period of time where I'm doing stuff.

More than ever I feel separated from my friends and am beginning to get fed up with them and the constant memeing. My school work is alone, my hobbies are alone, my days at school are alone and I'm starting to feel it too. I have a weirdly high alone threshold for people my age so me feeling this means it's really getting to breaking point. 

I suppose the only saving grace is my family, but we're a very busy family that works 13 hour days more often then not and so we only get probably an hourish worth of conversation every day. My brother and I are alright (I don't ""hate"" my sibling like many people do at my age), both me and my parents are on good terms and they are fairly lenient. (I say lenient, but they've instilled within me the ""don't be a dickhead"" mentality and I honestly follow this premise. A smack in the back of the head is always an option if I am a dickhead though) They are a great family, and I love them, but I'm so bad at expressing my feelings that I don't want to tell them. I feel embarrassed even thinking about it. 

Anyway, thanks for reading if you did. Sorry if it was a bit long, I just needed this.",lonely,16M lonely,2020-06-16 19:17:05
1396,FarrieSyed,1592299016,1,"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL68bTLmYL-n4531bW-hmPF1vFoUOuMgRl

Hi, this is Farrie Syed, a Victim of Mental and Physical abuse and harassment at the hands of my Parents, their families, my Teachers, School Authorities, Bullies and a victim of Sexual Assault, Nepotism, Corruption and Selfish management of schools and colleges. My journey has been tough with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolarity, Suicidal Thoughts and a lot of failures and thorns in my journey 

 I know you might be wondering why I chose to tell you all the story of my life.
The purpose of telling you all my story was to let my story out in the world even when I knew it was too risky and I could get killed or my existence could've gotten wiped off this earth. I had to let it all out in the world to give hopes to the ones who haven't found themself through yet or still struggle to find themselves as they get too lost and either just give up or they live in their pain and regrets what people make them go through and pull them down from fulfilling their dreams or atleast having a happy life. I just wanted to make a difference to their lives and help them realize and know that death or running away from your problems is never an option but to face them all courageously, not take insults and discouragements too personally and understand and realize your worth because deep down you know that all this discouragement isn't worth to be felt because they just wanna bring you down or pull you away from what you would've gotten had you not paid attention to their awful words. 

I had nobody to help me understand that. I had nobody to help me realize that. Nobody to tell me what's right or wrong when I was going through all of this. But I saved myself from the depths of my depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and bipolarity by understanding all of this that I have all the right to breathe, live and mould my life my way accordingly because this is my life and nobody gets to dictate or predict my future and say my life's gonna be worse or like hell. 
But not many people are quick to understand this and do something they should have not done and hurt their own self while the people who gave them all the pain live their life happily. I talked about myself here in this series because I believe that If my story could make a difference in the life of even one person that I'd believe that I have saved myself again. I wanna make a difference and help stop suicide, bipolarity, depression and anxiety, addiction rates because I feel the pain people have to go through and I wanna make a difference not just because I have been through the pain but because I believe that everybody deserves to be happy in their life and even if I would've not gone through all of this I still believe that I would've still shown my support because I am a sensitive human being. 

I know I completely understand that you might have even gone through worse than me but ask yourself ""Is this supposed to be thr end? Giving up too soon? Is this supposed to be this way? To live in pain and never fight back? Accept defeat? Is there no other option left? Have all doors closed for me?""

Because the fact is that though darker times might have surrounded us when we see dark clouds all over us but we must remember that these dark clouds don't last long and after every dark cloud there is a clear blue sky. You have to be stronger to get through that. You know if you give up and feel like you have been surrounded by smoke and there is no way to pass through or you are surrounded by demons and you can't pass through or you are too weak and not too strong to get through your problems then you won't unless you tell yourself you are strong, get back on your feet and rise up and you will get through this and fight back. 

I know that's not easy. Nothing is but believe me when you start building up that strength within you, you realize that all what these people ever told you or made you go through doesn't decide how you are going to be because you deserve a lot better in life.

We must also remember that when we work hard and get defeated or we get pulled down in a certain way and miss out on certain opportunities that doesn't mean that it's the end. It's the beginning of a new dawn wherein you have to build yourself as a stronger person than you were earlier because when one door of opportunity closes down for us, a thousand more open and we have to find it and figure out what we do next. 

The world has a lot of sides, good, bad, even more bad, darker, the worst. The journey is never too easy and filled with several obstacles we have to get through, People have a lot of faces and we have to be prepared for all of that for a better tomorrow we seek. We must be prepared for the worst because deep down we all wanna be happy. 

You know, very often this whole journey we take might be too risky when you choose to emerge as a stronger individual and fight for yourself for a better tomorrow to break free. But you must not give up. There is a chance we might make out alive even before we get killed by the ones who hurt us but do remember that even if we die fighting for our right to live and building a path of happiness for ourselves working hard in whichever direction you choose strongly, we will die a martyr. Martyrs have a high regard. You will be the warrior because you never gave up till your last breath and believed in a better day. But if you give up and hurt yourself you might miss out on a lot of things you could have had, had you learned to be stronger all along and fought back and survived and got through. But yeah if you think even if you fight back and you get killed and die as a martyr and what's in it for you if dying is the ultimate end ans it's better to kill yourself that kind of negative thought isn't true because killing yourself and getting killed to die as a martyr have a lot of difference in their own way because when you fight back and get killed fighting for your right you are. A warrior. Because you learned to be stronger, you built yourself all along with the hope for a better tomorrow and never gave up and worked hard for that, you learned to be confident and brave to face all these obstacles. You became a phoenix that rose from his own ashes. You got prepared to face any pain, any obstacle in your way for a better tomorrow. This is what's in it. This is what's in it because this is it. And what if you  succeed in this journey and somehow make out alive? You get to live a beautiful life you desired, your dreams and everything come true.

 We must always be positive even when negativity comes strolling and believe in ourselves and hold onto ourself because nobody else ever would as this is our life, we are living it and we are breathing it. Nobody knows you better than your own self and We are the master of our own fate which we have to be. 

That's what I have learned so far in this world. I don't know If I might live to see a tomorrow, nobody knows if they will because death barges in without knocking anytime, any moment, any day, any minute, any second at any age by any cause natural or unnatural but fearing death or accepting defeat would deprive you of all the happiness you wanted. 

We must remember the greatest visionaries had they given up, do you think their visions would've been successful? 

Successful businessmen, successful inventors, successful artists, actors, musicians, sport persons, social media stars, successful social activists, successful ceos, many successful people. All of them unique in their own way, had they given up, had they been successful in life. Do you think we would've had the luxuries of light, fan, electricity had they given up. It was all the hardwork and perseverance of them that it was a success. All of them had their own different and interesting life stories. They didn't pay any attention to the criticism, torture, disgrace and insults they got. They just worked hard to do something because they knew they could. Had they given attention or discouraged themselves I think they would've never been successful and neither would we have known what light, fan, phone, computer, electricity etc is till today. 

The people who fought for the independance of their nation from the tyrants who ruled over them, many died but never gave up till their final breath because they believed in a beautiful tomorrow not just for themselves but for the future generations to come because they wanted a better world and humanity to thrive. Don't you think if they would've been like ""Nah. I'm scared I might get killed. We must just keep our heads low and be a slave."" Do you think that would've been nice. Do you think those countries would've been free with that attitude? Never!  Given the fact that at times various independance struggles were started with just one person taking up the initiative to put his word forward daringly though that's different he faced a lot of torture and hardships but what did it yeild him and his nation? Independance as they all came.together to fight the evil independantly. Likewise I wanted to raise my voice and show my support to you all watching through my videos in this series because I really wanted to make sure that nobody hurts  themselves or live in pain over the people who hurt them and the pain they make them go through but instead brave it like a warrior.

Every day many people die in war zones like Syria and Palestine. But the people there haven't given up. They are still fighting their tyrants because they believe that someday life will be great and what they are fighting for someday they will have it. Even when it's too risky. Because if not them, they could make a difference to the lives of the future generations so that they live and don't go through the hardships they went through. 

The main point I wanna convey through all of this is what will you do next? Live for yourself or for somebody else who controls your life?

Also, if you are going through a severe phase of Bipolarity or battling panic attacks or suicidal thoughts at a level when you feel like it's getting worse. Please seek a licenced Medical therapist's help as they can help yoi get through this. Remember don't feel ashamed to seek help from the ones who can provide it to you if you could have access to it in any way possible. Because seeking professional help isn't wrong if it could actually help you in a lot of ways to feel better. 

And to those people who don't have any access to any medical resources living in a home like mine or even a worse house or country, I'd wanna say please don't do anything to hurt yourself. I'm begging you again. Please if you can, Listen to or watch this whole video again and understand that nothing is hard and that you must have to be a warrior though it might be hard to fight back but please understand that your life matters to you and it's important and this  struggle will be worth someday when you fight back and rise back up and win this battle to emerge out as a stronger human being all along. 

Thankyou so much to every single person who sticked till the end of the series or atleast till the end of the video to watch this. It's truly an amazing honour to be talking about my life, depression, anxiety, bipolarity, courage and all of these issues with you all and I hope my story, my journey and this series helps someone in any way.

After that she threw me out like the trash I am, didn‚Äôt even have the common decency to pop my cherry or even kiss me. At least I have some enjoyment in my pitiful existence, and a few things to look forward too. Before quarantine I went to the gym upwards of six times a week, 3-4 hours a day. Now I just do some workouts for like 30 minutes. Maybe I‚Äôll end it all after George R.R. Martin finishes the ASOIAF series. I love those books more than my sister. I also want to finally finish all FromSoftware/Bandai Namco SoulsBourne series. Summer is always a lonely time for me, and I can‚Äôt wait until I stop feeling this way everyday. What do I have to live for besides what I already stated? Nothing. I‚Äôll get into college, but I‚Äôm mostly white so no affirmative action and no great college.

A girl I loosely knew in high school started training at the store I work at but she'll be leaving to work at the other one anytime now.  We've sorta hit it off but my anxiety gets the best of me.  I'm very hesitant to start an actual thing with her for a number of reasons.

Firstly, a few older coworkers at the other store have been creepily flirting with her and shes reported them.  They're being investigated.  Now, my intentions are pure but I'm not good at communicating so I am scared something I say will be taken the wrong way and become an issue.

Secondly, I'm a rather distant person.  Me being cozy with her sends a red flag to my other coworkers whom I've kept at arms reach because... anxiety.  I don't want her to think I'm just ""dtf"" or a creep. I just think shes pretty, funny, and has a promising future.

And lastly, I'm just scared.  What if she doesnt like me? As I said before, we were loosely connected in high school and some of her friends know my social medias..  I'm genuinely being worn down by all of this. I cant stop thinking about her.  Shes even got a tattoo that reminds me of something I experienced as a child.  I'm obsessed with her but I feel like this is anxiety that will become fleeting satisfaction and then sorrow.

1432,spookyvegannn,1592280045,1,"It's my sophomore year at college. I'm not doing too great (academically), but my work is going super well! The second semester had just started and I was dead set on improving my grades; an ideal goal. For one of my classes, Professional Skills in Business, I had to do the awful ""pray to God that there's an open seat in this 100 person lecture"" thing, and it couldn't have worked out any better. I sat in the back corner with someone who would soon grow to mean a lot to me; let's call him J. 

I had seen him around campus before and he stuck out to me. I don't know what it is, but my brain and body do this thing where I already know that someone will be important to me and my life before I even know it. I saw this guy once a year before at Pick n' Save and he stuck to my brain ever since. So, I walked up to him, said ""anyone sitting here?"", and sat down. At first, it was just quiet between us; it was a lecture, after all. But I'm someone who can't stay quiet for very long. As the class went on, I started making little comments to him; just small things, nothing too crazy or distracting, but he seemed okay with it. He didn't mind me being chatty. This went on and on for a couple of classes.

Until one day. He walked in, sat down, and we got to talking as we usually did before class. I mentioned something about my Econ class later that day. Funnily enough, he told me that we were in the same class. It took place in the same room that we were already in, but I guess I just never saw him. Today, we decided to sit with each other again from thereon. Same spot, back right corner, same room. It was nice to have consistency, especially in something stressful for me, like classes. Later that day, he sat down next to me in Econ and we began talking again. He mentioned something about how he doesn't socialize much and always just relaxes in his dorm. So, out on a limb, I asked him: ""Want to go hang out afterwards? I work at Starbucks and I can get us some coffee."" Surprisingly, he agreed. 

After classes were done for the day, I walked to my car, picked him up, and off we went. We kind of seemed like opposites; to ends of the spectrum. I'm loud, big personality, super chatty. But J? He wasn't. He was reserved. Intellectual. Very careful, but witty and smart, with what he'd say. We got to Starbucks around 4 pm and didn't end up leaving until 9 that night. We sat and talked and talked about anything and everything under the sun. I was fascinated with how much culture he knew and all the stories he had about traveling to Italy and how he longed to be back. The tables flipped. I was quiet and attentive and he just kept going and going. It was fantastic. 

I want to make this clear: this isn't a love story. This is me making a true and genuine bond with someone before life gets in the way. Back to the story. 

Time went on and we'd hang out. He talked to me about some personal stuff. He was sad. He was down. Stuff wasn't always sitting right with him and he almost felt lonely; he didn't have a reason to leave his dorm. Loneliness doesn't bother him the same way it bothers me. 

I'm a giving person. I truly cared about this person. I formed that bond. I'd get him a tea after work, or some other little snacks or whatnot as an ""I hope you're doing okay!"" treat; things I'd appreciate if people would do them for me. Things eventually started to change. 

As high school as it sounds, the drama started to arise. I always kept my significant other up to date with what I was doing; I didn't want them to feel weirded out that I was suddenly hanging out with this random person all the time. But on J's side of the coin, it wasn't all the same. His significant other didn't like me. Thought that us getting close was threatening their relationship. Sent me angry messages on Instagram about J's whereabouts. I was confused. I saw this entire thing as ""I've made a connection with someone that I want to keep. I'd want someone to take care of me when I'm down, so I'm gonna do the same for them."". But his S/O didn't see it that way. 

Communication between J and I went down. He claimed he couldn't talk to me anymore to save his relationship, but then went back and forth with saying it was/wasn't okay. I got more angry messages from the S/O. The constant interchange of ""it's okay!"" and ""it's not okay!"" got me exhausted. 

I messaged the S/O and said ""Listen. This whole time, I've wanted J to be happy. I sincerely apologize if that came off as flirty or wrong or anything like that; I don't want to steal your relationship. I'm happy with mine. From the start, I have tried doing what I could to remedy his situation and help out where I could. If me leaving the picture is what you two need to move on from this and be happy then, even though it sucks for me, I'll do it. I want him to be okay."".

 Just like that, it was over. 

This whole interaction took place over the course of about 2-3 months. The point of this is for me to try and put this out into the universe and see where it takes me. I've been thinking about him a lot recently; he's popped into my dreams, daydreams, and literally anything else. I want to make sure he's okay, but I don't want to overstep boundaries. I don't want to cause problems. But there's something inside me that keeps saying that our story isn't over yet and that there's still more to come. 

I hope there is.   


J, if you're reading this, I miss you. I hope you're okay. I hope I didn't mess anything up for you. I'm sorry. I want you to know that every time I see a bagel I think of you mocking me.

I get it I really do and I do appreciate the contructive critocism im getting for trying to be social I get it. You guys say ill never have friends I get it. You guys say I can't expect people to let me touch their hair I get it. You guys tell me to only do that in sex or in a relationship I get it. I get that 90% of society hates me for being myself. I get what you all are saying to me and I always hear it being said in my head all the time. The thing is well heres where you guys are WRONG. You guys are judging others based on their kinks or the way they look or the color of their skin or their gender. Now thats whats wrong with you guys. Do you guys get it, because I do. 

I am not here to bitch about you guys im here asking you guys to LISTEN PLEASE. Ok here are my intentions and I would like some input about it. No advice just input. Ok I am an autistic Guy who likes touching hair right. Whats wrong with that. Theres no need to discriminate me im being myself. 

Im not bitching on you about your thing am I no I wasn't raised to be an asshole to others. I was raised to be myself and fuck everyone else who doesn't like me for who I am. Yes I sound very selfish because you think all im doing is talking about myself and I do agree I am selfish sometimes. But thats not why im here venting. Im here to ask your guys honest to god support on where I can find where I belong. Thats all I ask is it that hard to ask for help? I guess it is. 

Yes im obssesed with hair and no im not going to be a hair dresser or buy a wig or waste money on ponytails of hair no I don't want that. There is this magical thing called friends and they are great if they like you and you like them. But heres the issue, finding them is the hard part. Keeping them is even harder. My question to you guys is where can I make some friends who get my intentions. I DON'T want sex I don't. No dating or relationships. Just a friend whos 18+ and lives in Michigan is that hard to ask? Please be humble and tell me where I can find these people and no discrinination please I don't like it.

I would like a long term friendship because I can't have fun by myself anymore and I get judged and teased for my autism and etc. Its not fun being me right now but if youd like to get to know me better please keep reading.

I am a 20 year old Male

I am from Kentucky but I live in Michigan near the city of Jackson now

I am a PC Gamer and an Computer IT Nerd. I play MMOFPS, Sandbox, FPS, Arena Shooters, and sometimes Strategy games. I usually use Steam to play all my games. Sometimes I use Battle.net, Origin or even Epic Games Launcher. I have all Minecraft versions. I am mainly hooked onto the game Space Engineers because its really fun to play to me. If you ever wanted to play a high end games on a crappy PC use the application Geforce Now. I am on here to make friends who can see my true self all through the odd things about me which im about to explain. I am autistic with Asperger Syndrome, ADHD, OCD and hard headed mentally/physically. I do have trouble with fitting into society because people judge me for who i am. I will take any friend I get. I would like to make friends in person but thats been a struggle for me for the longest time. People judge me because I have a tendency to like to touch peoples hair if they are ok with it. I know im odd ok we all are. Im not trying to make friends just to use people to touch their hair. Ive tried making friends without the hair thing and still no one liked me. If you see the light through me you will understand why i act this way. I know i may be a discrase to society but if you think you can have fun with me please send me a Direct Message.

I do want to give you a small disclaimer before I continue. Whatever I'm gonna write now is the way I look at myself, other people may perceive me differently. Now we're cool? Cool! So, I'm just like any other person out there who's trying to survive and find a meaning in life. But I like to see myself a bit differently. I sometimes question my very existence. What purpose do I serve on this planet? Well, it's a question whose answer I'm still trying to figure out. Anyways, I'm a complicated and difficult person. It's really tough for anyone to be my friend. You see, I have this really bad anxiety problem which simply doesn't let me trust anyone or anything. Because of my anxiety, I take everything personally. If someone takes a little too long to answer a text, I start making assumptions. They don‚Äôt want to talk to me. I‚Äôm annoying them. They‚Äôre ignoring me on purpose. They don‚Äôt like me. They hate me. Even if I receive an answer after five short minutes, I will still look too far into details. If the text is short or sounds snippy, then I will worry that I am wasting their time, that they are only answering me to be polite. I will fool myself into thinking I shouldn‚Äôt have sent the text in the first place. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long I have known someone. I need constant reassurance that I am loved. Otherwise, I will jump to the worst-case scenario. I will assume that I have done something to upset them, that they don‚Äôt want me around anymore, that everything is against me. Well, you can say I have major trust issues. And due to this very reason (and a couple of other reasons too), I recently lost a very close friend of mine. I lost someone who stood by me when no one did, someone very important. I really miss her a lot. So yeah, I clearly have issues. But enough of that now. Moving on, I would like to talk about the fact that I've seen people judge me for my looks, the way I talk, the way I interact and it just makes me sick to my stomach. Honestly, I just don't like being judged. I too used to judge people, not gonna lie but I stopped doing that a while ago. I also have anger issues. This something which my roommates and perhaps even my classmates can tell you. I lose my temper very easily. But it's something I'm working on and hopefully, I'll be able to overcome it. What else? Umm... Oh right. I also don't like being around people too much. I really like the comfort of my own bed. I like to sit in complete darkness with my earphones on, disconnected from the real world and lost in my fantasy. (Btw if you got some nice music recommendations then please hmu.) I also like to play with words. Sometimes I just let the emotions flow through my words. One more thing, I'm super lazy. Like seriously super-duper lazy. What else? Well... I suffer from FOMO. So, please just tell me the latest gossip. And oh yeah, I have some major OCD problem. It's really hard to live with that but I'm trying my best. I like to rant a lot. Just give me a topic. Now coming to the good stuff, I'm a huge Marvel fan but my favourite movie series is Back to the future. My all-time favourite song is Bohemian Rhapsody and I'm currently hooked up to If I can't have you. My favourite colour is blue and I am an Apple fanboy. Talking about love, the thing is that... you know what? Let's leave something for the next time. And at last (I promise this the last one), no matter how much people hate me and no matter how many bad things are there on my way, I'll never give up. That's one thing that I've learnt through my struggle to exist is to not give up. Oh wow! I just realised that I've written a lot. As I told you before I overthink a lot so idk if I'm even gonna post this or not. If you're reading it then probably, I've made the biggest mistake of my life. What's done is done. No looking back. TL;DR I'm a not so selfish individual with a bad temper suffering from anxiety and OCD. Honestly speaking, a lot of people seeing this post might not even read it, some might make fun of me but there will be someone out there who's gonna understand and probably relate to me. So to that person out there, a huge virtual hug. If you've made this far then I would like to thank you so much for taking out time to read this. It truly means a lot. Even after reading all of this about me, if you're still interested in talking to me and maybe even telling your own story then please DM me. I'm all ears now. That's all from my side folks. It's truly very relaxing to finally let all of this flow away from my mind. Adios!",lonely,"I'm like any other human, trying to find my meaning in this world.",2020-06-16 09:26:29
1447,Waffle_And_Bacon,1592262581,1,"Having trouble deciding if I want to go to my high school‚Äôs end of year ball (Final year)

So I‚Äôm in year 12 which is the last year at the high school I go to. Since the ball is for year 11‚Äôs and 12‚Äôs, I went last year but didn‚Äôt enjoy it as I didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äòpartner‚Äô for the ball and I just sat at a table and watched everyone dance and be social together for 3 hours. To make it worse my crush was there with her boyfriend.
I‚Äôm part of a ‚Äòfriend group‚Äô although I‚Äôm the outside of it and I‚Äôm not included in most things that they do. I still have a crush on the same girl and she‚Äôs going with her bf again. My ‚Äòfriends‚Äô are all in relationships as well so I‚Äôd be the only single person there. 
Even though the ball doesn‚Äôt happen till the end of the year, I doubt anyone will want to be my ‚Äòpartner‚Äô, and I haven‚Äôt dated anyone in my life so my skills at trying to find a girl to ask is nonexistent thanks to that and other fun mental issues I have - anxiety, self hatred and the big sad.
So to wrap this rambling up, either i go to the ball alone and sit at a table for three hours or stay home and be sad, fun choices - I know.

TL:DR - I went to the ball last year but didn‚Äôt enjoy it and I‚Äôm conflicted with going this year even though it‚Äôs the last year in my high school, but if I go there, I‚Äôll probably end up being alone at a table for 3 hours or just stay home and do nothing like usual.",lonely,Can‚Äôt decide if I should go to my school‚Äôs end of year ball (I‚Äôm in my final year),2020-06-16 09:09:41

But sometimes a sudden wave of loneliness, sadness and depression hits me outta nowhere n then suddenly it feels like I'm annoying everyone n i somehow even see signs like ppl ignoring me or talking rudely. I don't like texting them or tell anyone that i need someone tho. If someone wants to talk to me cuz they like to, then i talk and keep talking until they go. But i never really text anyone first especially when this wave hits me. I myself really like when someone texts me and says that they want to vent to me n share their problems cuz they feel lonely asf but i never text anyone that I'm feeling lonely or that i want to talk. Whenever this wave hits me no one is talking to me n I'm completely alone. I'm hiding my depression and feeling of loneliness from everyone. Now even my partner cuz we end up arguing sometimes or fighting n i don't want to annoy other ppl so i just keep it to myself n it really hurts in the chest but I'm fine after i wake up. The worst part is no one knows about this n they all think I'm a happy happy shit poster lmao. I try to sleep to skip time but it doesn't matter cuz i just can't even if i listen to music.

Last year, I had a mental breakdown. I had lived in an emotional state that exhausted me for years, trying desperately to keep my family and home together through my husband's substance abuse and abusive tendencies towards me. He struggled with alcohol mostly, after many years clean from opiates. However, last year he relapsed with Heroin, and it was the final straw that broke me. I sent him away for months to get clean. I sank into a very dark place where I couldn't eat, or sleep, or function. I worked two jobs, threw myself into work and tried desperately to keep a smile on for my own 2 kids until bed, when I would collapse and scream and cry, every single night. 

And then, I found horrortube. It was the only thing that could take my mind from my own horrific life. My husband returned, now clean and sober, and all abuse stopped. But I was still sad and stressed. 

There was one narrator in particular that I listened to religiously. Every night I managed to actually fall asleep and stay asleep if I listened to him. His voice was calming and brought me peace. In the car, I always turned him on, I would go for long drives. If I were particularly stressed I would drive to my favorite peaceful spot and listen and try to nap. In doing this, I accidentally conditioned myself to only fall asleep or relax to his voice. 

Flash forward to april, I become more involved in his community. I attend live streams and become pretty well known amongst his regulars. I join his discord and become friends with many folks there. I donate to his streams, often donating up to $100. I bought in to his Patreon. Eventually I approached him, asking if I could commission him for a personalized sleep video as he had mentioned it in a live before to me. 

His response was that I should just talk to him. I was surprised, but I did. A lot, actually. Almost immediately he made it clear he was...romantically interested. Or, I thought so. I made it clear I had multiple children and a husband but, considering my marriage has been dead for years, I decided to play along. He lived hundreds of miles away. He would flort, but would also say some rewlly sweet things that melted my heart. 

For the first time in years I found a community I fit in to, and someone I really looked up to was actively speaking to me and listening, he complimented my views on things and we discussed lots of political/social ideas. 

And then one day, he stopped speaking to me. One word responses or none at all. I was hurt, but assumed he was busy. But after a few days I decided to just approach him about it. I admit I probably did bug him quite a bit...I was just excited, ya know? I told him exactly what my life was like. That I was lonely and I may bug him because it's been so long since anyone LISTENED to me. He laughed it off and said ""I like it"". 

When I approached him, he said basically that, flirting is fun but realistically nothing more than that made sense since nothing would ever come from it. i was so hurt, but lonely enough to try to find a hidden meaning in it because I'm stupid. Later, I messaged him again and said well hey, since we can still flirt....and....ya know, attempted to do so. 

He said, flirting online doesn't make him feel better and he'd rather talk about ideas and stuff. I was confused, and I said so. I asked him what he meant, that firstvhe says he only wants to flirt than talk ideas and then immediately says he'd rather not flirt and only talk ideas...I said hey, if you just want nothing to do with me, say so because it's easier to understand than whatever this is. 

He got upset after that, said I was pressuring him, that I was throwing him an emotional coaster and he didn't want this. I apologized, super hurt, but still stupid enough to not want to sacrifice a friendship. He later said if we took it much slower we could maintain (as friends). 

I was heartbroken. And I know it's stupid, but if you've been deprived of human connection and haven't felt special to anyone in years, and then someone comes along and makes you feel listened to and cared about, you get attached. It just happens. My self esteem took a huge hit. Him being very angry with me hurt because he's not an angry guy. I screwed up, I should have just let it go and stopped being annoying but of course I have to take it too far and look like a psycho. 

We talked a few times after that...nothing really big or anything. Mostly one word responses. Then, yesterday, he just stopped responding completely. And I know he's just trying to be nice but he clearly is uninterested in even friendship and for whatever reason it still hurts me. Another member of the discord reached out to me...she kind of sensed something was ""blossoming"" between us due to his comments about me in lives and our communications in discord and asked what was up. I explained the situation. She had actually rejected his advances months before and said ""but then you showed up and he left me alone and it was honestly so cute"". She agrees, he could have been more nice, but I tried to put on a face of not caring for her because honestly I was embarrassed. 

My issue is now....his voice makes me incredibly sad. I can't fall asleep to it anymore. I tried driving to my happy place and listening to his stuff but, again, overwhelming sadness. The communities I've joined of his, they feel foreign to me now. What's the point in being there at all if the creator himself doesn't want me around? I tried to attend live streams...and before we would communicate through lives and almost every message I sent was ignored. I donated a few times, but why? Why financially contribute to a person who doesn't like me at all? 

I wish I never took the step to be friends, or whatever kind of situation we were in. I feel used, like he got bored with me and just kinda tossed me. I feel unimportant. Last night he narrated ""catfish"" stories and, he knew I was there, and he kept making comments about people not actually being the person they thought they were and maybe I was reading too far into it but I felt like some of it was directed at me. So I left the stream. 

I'm definitely going to refrain from spending anymore money with them. I'm canceling my Patreon donations, I won't donate or attend the streams. I haven't decided to leave the Discord yet, I've met some great people there but it does bring me emotional pain. And just knowing how easy it was for them to wash their hands with me and move along, idk. It all just hurts. 

I know I'm emotionally fragile. I was open about it the whole time. I know to them, this would appear to be insane, that I'm so upset over something so small.

But all of this has amplified my self hatred so much. Anyway. This was long, I guess I just needed to get it out.",lonely,"Befriended my favorite content creator, now they can't stand me and it affected me more than I thought it would.",2020-06-16 03:08:51

No more seeking relationships.  Romantic or otherwise.  No more stupid dating apps, no more wondering if I'll die alone.  Because I don't care anymore.  

I'm a broken man of 25.  Had too much ripped from me.  Dreams crushed for no reason other than happenstance.  I can't deal with it anymore.  So I'll just bury it deep down into the recesses of my mind, and pray to God they never surface.

I never considered myself to be lonely, but deep inside i knew i was only lying to myself.

I never was a people person, i always saw myself as the socially awkward kid and so i never even bothered trying, some of my closest friends are my oldest friends who keep me because they know the real me.

The truth is life goes on and so do people, time waits for none and definitely not for me.

I may not admit to myself but i have severed many ties and broken many bridges because people tend to misunderstand people.

I've never been one to be gloomy and see the black parts of life but the truth is life comes in blacks and whites, it has it ups and it has its downs, I've loved and I've lost, I've trusted and I've been betrayed in the worse ways possible, i have tried seeing the whites in life but somehow the black always seems to overshadow the whites, I've been depressed, I've lost people i love without getting the chance to say goodbye, I've been kicked in the curb, I've felt suicidal, I've felt awful, I've  been sad, and there were moments where the only safe space was my bed but I've also been high on life with moments where i felt like a fucking king.

I've also been madly in love with the woman i thought would be there for me in my happiest hours and saddest moments, only for life to kick me down, beat me up and disappoint me again, but I've also learned that happiness does not work that way.

Being alone never bothered me, i enjoy my solitude as it gives me time to truly reflect on myself and life, while it never bothered me it also felt wrong because that isn't all there is to life and what good are memories if you have no one to share the happy and good times with.

Truth be told i guess i never truly appreciated the gift of life but i also dont wanna die young, having achieved nothing in life but a few heartbreaks and disappointments, leaving no legacy behind, with few people who will remember me as the average guy, i dont want people to get used to me not being around anymore, life isn't fair for anyone but i would be lying if i said life isn't damn beautiful and sometimes all you have to do is enjoy the view while it lasts.",lonely,On loneliness.,2020-06-16 00:20:08

1484,LonelyGal1234,1592228709,1,"Hi, I‚Äôm posting on a throwaway. I just need to get this off of my chest. I‚Äôve known this guy for about 5-6 years now. We‚Äôll call him ‚ÄúChris‚Äù. We used to be super close. We could pretty much tell each other everything and we talked all the time. I ended up developing feelings for him but never pursued them. 

Anyway, about three years into the friendship when I turned 17. I started dating this guy that was bad news from the start. My friends all told me that it was a bad idea and I wish I had listened to them. He constantly emotionally abused me and I ended up ditching all of my previous friends for him. We dated for about a year until we broke up and I managed to rekindle my friendships. That lasted for a while.

Then I started dating someone in our friend group which was short-lived but ended in a messy breakup. I ended up ghosting the entire friend group because I wasn‚Äôt in the right frame of my mind. Over a year had passed before ‚ÄúChris‚Äù ended up messaging me and telling me that he missed me and wished I would come back to the friend group.

Everyone in the group has accepted me back with open arms and seems to be acting like nothing ever happened - except for ‚ÄúChris‚Äù. He barely talks to me and when we do it‚Äôs super short. I just feel like I am bothering him now. He‚Äôs says he not mad about me ghosting him but I feel like he is. I wouldn‚Äôt blame him. I severely fucked up. I was young and stupid and I wish I could take it all back now that I am older and in a better state of mind.

I know it‚Äôs crazy to feel so alone when I have an entire group of friends still but I miss what we used to have like crazy. I still have feelings for him after all this time even though I know we‚Äôll probably never have a chance to be together due to certain circumstances. I even told him how I felt and that I didn‚Äôt actually expect anything. I just wanted him to know. I now feel ruined the friendship even more because even though he took it good - we haven‚Äôt talked since that night. I just feel like such an idiot.

1485,itchystinky3,1592228202,1,"From a young age, I've always dreamed of being in a relationship. I've been fed all the Disney movies and raised with parents and mentors whom were very progressive, especially about respecting women and their desires. Always watching as others got into relationships, I was always told at first that highschool relationships were a joke, university relationships were just as fickle and securing a good career was more important than romance. Then I was labeled a late bloomer.

After all that, here I am at 30, soon 31 years old, never having held hands, hugged or kissed a girl or woman. And I've got nothing to show for it either. No house, no car, no stable job, no degree, no bank account, no friends, no social life, no entertainment. All those who had reassured me back then have moved on with their lives, in successful long term relationships.

I could probably stomach my current lifestyle if I had a someone. Someone just to share the interesting parts of the day with, good and bad. Just hold and to be held. To hear and to be heard. To accept and be accepted. To care and be cared for. A pure, responsiblity free relationship. Where I just have to be a decent person and partner, and not have to prove some arbitrary value like looks or financial success.

But I can't get anyone's attention. Women my age and above look at the way I live and see a loser who hasn't got his life together, looking to mooch. Those younger than me see me as a predatory abusive creep. And this hurts me so much. Because other (uncultured)men have ruined the reputation for older guys. Because the reassurances I got when I was younger was a lie. Because the way I was raised was a lie. If I could go back I would have lived so differently, chased what I wanted and maybe succeeded, rather than chase what others wanted and fail.

As the years go by, I find  I have less energy available to try new things and meet new people. The list of chronic pains and health issues keeps ever increasing. Even if by chance I met someone tomorrow, I don't know if I still have a personality, as I've interacted with less people every year. The loneliness and rejections have turned me so bitter, could I even muster up some positive thoughts?

It doesn't help that I recently got an official diagnostic that I'm on the spectrum, with an emphasis on ""definitely on the autistic side of the fence"", after a runin with the law.

I feel like an old cat in the animal shelter. Years of meowing ""Please adopt me! I promise I'll be a good pet!"". But no one ever came. Now I'm an eyesore, and the world can't wait to be rid of me. 

For all the younger people here, I hope as many of you as possible don't end up like me and put yourself out there now. I may have nothing, but the only thing that hurts and corrodes is the loneliness. You get used to everything else, from the stresses of work and money to the physical pains of poor sleep, diet and an aging body.

Now, they always smoke weed and get high, abd I don't (personal choice, I don't care if they do), so I think they don't invite me because I may be a buzzkill. I value good conversation, so talking to someone who is high is just an exercise in frustration.

  My father destroyed my self esteem and my interests, because he views being a nerd as a disease, and he yells at me whenever I do anything he wouldn't do.

I cant see a therapist, because my useless insurance wont cover mental health, I have no income, and still can't find a job, and my dad won't help because ""therapists are for pussies.""

I had bad anxiety as a kid and was always kind of isolated off on my own. Definitely over my anxiety now but the military kind if made me the opposite where I dont take things I should as seriously ss I should  now. Noone really listened to mewhen I tried to speak up for myself growing up. So I got really good at being independent. 

But I'm so good at being independent that I'm 31 and starting to think more about what I want. I'm fine alone but scared I'll wake up at 60 and regret it.

I have a little credit card debt I should have paid off at the end if the year and can go back to saving. I have a house and a mortgage but its low. I could support a family once credit card debt it paid off and I had a year or two to get ahead.

So I'm thinking about starting to date next year at 32. I need to work on myself first. Just develop healthy schedules. I'm bad about setting schedules and following them. Like cleaning regularly and all that.My diet needs to get better. I just think if I took the rest of the year I could get in shape, pay off credit card.

But I've never met anyone who really hears me and makes it a point to get to o ow how I am as a person. I might seem distant or cold if someone doesnt tell me. And no one ever just tells me. I make it a point to be emotionally available but I'm do independent and never relies on anyone to where I just sint think about it sometimes. Or I need to be alone some times to recharge and women always ask Are you mad and never hear me when I explain it. And also some are taken aback by it.

I'm just extremely introverted and dont think to share unless someone asks me to. I get annoyed early in when dating someone because they dont look at it like a partnership or dont try to get to know me and it's all about the woman.. 

I just think I need to make myself date and see if it's something I'm into. Sex never was a big deal to me which also makes wanting to date hard.

Throughout the years I have moved from state to state. I used to complain but I understand why. In doing so, it‚Äôs been difficult for me to open up to people and make friends. I have been meticulous with choosing friends because sometimes I feel like I am disposable. 

I have been in college classes, and many people are so interactive with one another, while I on the other hand, prefer to just go to my classes, learn and leave. 

I know that‚Äôs no way to enjoy life and my college career but I‚Äôve mentally shutdown to be honest. 
I don‚Äôt party, I hate drinking, and I just don‚Äôt socialize. I feel as if I‚Äôve matured too soon for my age. I feel like I‚Äôve realized too soon, the consequences of the irresponsibility that some of my peers partake in. Ignorance really is bliss.

I do however envy the amount of friends some of those peers have. It seems to be a pattern that birds of a feather flock together. Sadly, not many people are like me.

I used to be outgoing and nominated class clown two consecutive years in a row, in two different states. As time went on, I stopped trying to make people laugh. I consistently wear a facade to mask the emptiness of companionship. Yes I have close people that care about me, but there‚Äôs always that yearning for more. I see my parents have close friends, I have two people who check up on me sometimes have multitudes of close friends. 

I don‚Äôt understand how someone like me who used to be outgoing just broke down and lost the will to open up to people.

I‚Äôm not asking for anyone‚Äôs pity, but I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs so exhausting to feel alone.

Since kindergarten I was seen as the weird kid, I was fat, unathletic and overall was just seen as a joke to most of my classmates. The guys would act like my friend, but when it came to sports or going out I would just stay home and play videogames since I was never invited to anything in the first place, unless it was with my one best friend. Then came middle school, where it go a little better. I was super introverted, so I was looked at as more of the 'quiet' kid rather than the weird one. Later I got closer to my neighborhood friends who used to never hang out with me, and our bond was actually the tightest friendship I ever had. Then came 7th &amp; 8th grade. In 7th grade I decided to find some new friends, I actually had some school friends, but we weren't that close, so I went with them. We became super close, close as or even closer than my neighborhood friends. However, these new friends were 'unpopular' and 'weird' so I soon became an outcast just like in elementary school. It didn't help that I was pretty awkward and weird due to the fact that I was basically alone most of my earlier life, so I became even more of an outcast and was made fun of a lot in 7th. After that, 8th grade fucked me up the most. I found that I had stopped liking my friend group as much, and I told them I was probably going to leave soon, which they were okay with after a while. I joined a new friend group, but only a week after I was kicked out and had to rejoin my old group. What's worse is that my neighborhood friend group was made smaller, due to the fact that one of them found that he also didn't like us, so he hung out with other kids in the neighborhood. What fucked me up the most was quarantine. Quarantine obviously ended school, so all ties to my school friends were basically cut other than social media which I don't often use. Not only that, but recently two other people in my neighborhood group want to stop hanging out with me since they think I'm boring. My best friend, also seemingly doesn't want to hang out with me as much. In the end I can basically only blame myself. But I still fucking hate it.

Summer is finally here and I‚Äôve looked forward to it so much, but much like all the other things in my life, it hasn‚Äôt turned out how I expected. I expected to hang out with my friends almost every day, to be spontaneous and feel happy and content with the time I have. Now that it‚Äôs here, almost none of these things are coming true.

It‚Äôs obviously my own responsibility to make these things happen, but it‚Äôs so hard for me. I‚Äôve always wanted to be an outgoing and social person, but I don‚Äôt think I am. I want to hang out with people and be spontaneous, but every time I make plans it is dreadful. It‚Äôs always worse before I go to meet up with people, I always feel the need to plan out the things I should say and talk about. I usually never know what to talk about with anyone really, and it drives me crazy, so knowing what to say before relieves some of that stress I‚Äôm feeling. This is of course very tiring and I never feel like I‚Äôm truly being myself or actually being social. I could talk to people without ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù myself, but that makes it even worse for me because I can‚Äôt stand it being awkward.

After I‚Äôve hung out with some friends, I always feel embarrassed of myself and all of the things I might have said or done wrong. I‚Äôm always trying to prove to myself and others that I can be outgoing, but it always makes me extremely uncomfortable and I overthink every possible mistake. Because of this, jokes about some dumb thing I might have said always hurt so much, and it makes me fall into a spiral of self-hatred and doubt. After one of these ‚Äúridiculing comments‚Äù, it‚Äôs usually impossible for me to be able to engage myself in the conversation again because I‚Äôm drifting away into my own thoughts and emotions. At this point I usually just want to leave and be alone, and not meet people for a very long time. These situations can be very emotionally draining, and being alone for a while can help me to come to terms with my emotions.

But then again, I want to be social. I want to connect with other people and have close friends, but because of my fears and being so distant it can be very hard. This causes me to feel extremely lonely at times. I don‚Äôt feel happy when I‚Äôm alone, and I don‚Äôt feel happy when I am with people. I know this anxiety is something I have to work on a lot, but I don‚Äôt know how. All my feelings are overwhelming and I‚Äôm usually very sensitive, so it‚Äôs easy to take many steps back after making some progress.

I know this sounds kind of wimpy, pathetica and childish (which is why I dont tell anyone this) but
I have always dreamt of being a pro league of legends player. It has been 10 years so far. I can say that I atleast achieved something, I have peaked 657LP Challenger last seasin but currently diamond 3 1k games. 

I just couldnt help but feel so down, knowing I cant go back up to the way I used to be and I cant even start being a pro player. I have always been good at things, but cant be the best at it. I've always been that above average person at everything I do.

Will I be forced to work being a corporate slave? Cant I atleast grow up to work at the things I love?

1559,Clueless_guitar,1592169019,3,"So ever since I can remember Ive had this desire to be popular and liked. When i was about 10 years old, I used to make drawings of angels and then i'd name them ""angel of beauty"", and another one ""angel of smartness"" etc. And in my fantasy I hoped they would all grace me with their qualities so i could become damn near perfect. I've always overthought and overanalyzed things like that. Ive been pretty conscious of what people thought of me all my life and thats also the reason why I'm quite shy. Some context: I had a group of 4 friends in high school and i was decently liked by my classmates i feel like. I always looked up to that one group of 14 girls in my school, that got along so well and did fun things and were liked by all the guys.. The popular kids. Now pass forward im studying at uni and im in my 4th year. I live in a dorm but have a boyfriend back home (also been together for 4yrs). Since our relationship started at the beginning of university, it was all still new and exciting. So much that i didnt really focus on making friends that much. Our relationship took a lot of my time. I went to a city where i knew nobody and on the first night of uni i decided 'i can go out without friends, lets meet some new people'. I was very enthusiastic. That night i met a guy i talked to for a while and he assaulted me. I learned quickly there were dangers to coming out of my comfort zone. But now im 21 (still one year at university left) and i find myself - again- with only a couple of friends. Actually only one good one. This saddens me. Also when i look at instagram: people i went to high school with get 200 likes on their pics and i struggle to get to 100 sometimes. I know thats superficial but its still a symptom of me not doing too well socially. I feel like its too late and im forever gonna be lonely. Everyone already has their set group of friends at my age. Yes i can meet people when i start working later on, but its never gonna be the same. Im gonna try and join some clubs or groups but idk. I personally feel like i'm a fun person to be around. I like myself, but i feel like people don't recognize that in me. Im just overlooked. Wish the way i see myself would match how im seen socially.

I just wanna be part of some type of network. Now i just feel like I'm an outsider. If i would want to go to a party, there's no one i could go with. Here at uni other students (friend groups) often have dinner outside and i can hear their laughter and stories through my window and it makes me question where i went wrong and how i could stop being such a loner lol",lonely,"Always wanted to be liked, yet ended up without friends",2020-06-15 07:10:19

1567,Future_Potential,1592164357,7,"So I've always been a misfit oddball - there were a few years during uni I had lots of friends, just a few - those incredible days. But I fell out with the 'leader' of the group - ironically, who I considered my best friend - she turned out to be very selfish and abusive. Even so, I miss her every day because we spoke so much and were (as I thought, anyway) so close, even if it was a lie. I lost most of my friends then and those I didn't, moved away after uni. Now I live in a suburb with very little opportunity to meet people. I work in comms, by accident, which is full of people I can't be close to, who think I'm a weirdo (not unreasonably, I guess, I seem introverted and like some odd things). Even the ones I get on OK with don't \*like\* me as a person - they appreciate me as a colleague and tolerate me but they don't want to get close. Which is fine, I understand, it's OK. It's just a shame.

I'm so lonely. Making friends after age 30 is so, so impossible without a pre-existing social network or being incredibly lucky in terms of nearby social or sports groups or things. My hobbies are all very one-person-only and I can't drive so can't get to further-off activities or visit far off friends easily. 

Only since I've started therapy for depression and anhedonia have I realised how incredibly lonely I am. I want to be close to a friend again, have someone to talk to at any time, send funny messages and share secrets, know the important details of their lives and have fun with and care about. 

I mean, I am lucky. I have a loving husband. But he's a true introvert and happy with it - he has hobbies of his own where he can be with people when he wants (not ones that interest me so I can't join in). 

I'd do anything for a few close, nearby friends to hang out with often and share life with. I'm playing an rpg video game where the main characters all form a close friendship group and I'm so jealous. I want that so much.",lonely,Evening loneliness vent,2020-06-15 05:52:37

I‚Äôve spent my life alone(I have parents but I mean alone as in no one to have a connection with) and the only time I ever felt truly alive was when I was in college living in the dorms with friends.

I remember that even during semester breaks I would not want to go back home and preferred to go over my friends‚Äô or stay in college if I was allowed to or join any activities where there were people.

I do not connect with everyone I meet but at this point, I‚Äôm so desperate that I started to talk to random people I met when I go out(quarantine has somewhat been lifted here).

1571,SmurfRanger,1592161763,0,"Throwaway account obviously, because I have... quite a following elsewhere on the interwebs.

So, here's my (somewhat lengthy background) first. I was diagnosed with Aspergers at a young age. Nobody knows this outside my family, except for maybe 1 or 2 people (coworkers from a previous job). This caused me to get bullied constantly from elementary to senior high (hell, even in college). To be fair I had very weird antics and personal interests. I was always known as ""that weird kid"" and as a result of this, I was very unpopular. I wasn't invited to any parties or gatherings, always ate alone in the cafeteria, and didn't keep my friends after graduation. I basically lost touch with everyone because all the bullying coupled with my Aspergers made a blow to my self-esteem and made it really hard for me to form meaningful friendships.

There are 3 particular events that I remember to be the most scarring for me.

First is this girl who I was really into at the time. I tried to chat her up through IM, but came on too strong and she ranted to a mutual friend that I was ""feeling close"". All my future interactions with people and potential friends were severely affected by this.

There was another one where we were to exchange letters at a party of sorts. I wrote a letter to this guy thanking him for being a good friend, but the letter he wrote me explicitly states that I'm not a ""friend"" to him but a mere acquaintance. This caused me to be overly cautious when trying to form friendships with other people and develop trust issues (with myself and other people).

The third one was when the teacher told us to find a partner for a class activity, but because the class had an odd number of students, I was the only one left with no partner. In fact, I always was the odd one out every time the teacher calls for an activity like this. This cemented the notion that, ""maybe I'm always meant to be alone"".

This all carried over to adulthood. Even if it was so many years back, everything still haunts me. I feel like I missed a crucial part of my life where I should have developed essential skills, such as how to have conversations with people and how to keep friendships. I feel like the world has denied me of all of these opportunities. I'm still socially awkward as fuck and can't even start or hold conversations with people, and always had difficulty connecting with fellow human beings.

Fost forward to today. I finally discovered something that makes me happy and I'm very proud to share it with the world. Let's just say... that I'm a content creator. This has been the biggest source of self esteem for me lately. And since my Aspergers basically gives me superpowers when it comes to these sorts of things, I really poured my heart out on these content creation projects of mine. So, I really took off and established quite a reputation with my online presence.

As you can imagine, I get lots of praises and messages, which I really appreciate. The thing is that I let it get to my head and craved more and more of this kind of recognition. I always thought to myself - ""I may not have friends, but at least I have fans. I was always denied popularity and validation in my formative years, maybe this is my shining moment."" But no, I took this line of thinking too far. I gradually became the attention seeker that I now am today, always looking for the next opportunity to expand my following.

Every time I get likes/upvotes/comments/whatever, it gives my brain a dopamine hit even if they're from online strangers I couldn't care less about. And that is super addicting, as you know how social media can be. Even more so that in the back of my mind, I'm doing this as a form of silent revenge against the world for not giving me the recognition that I so deserve. A good motivator for sure, but a corrupt one.

This has been taking a toll on my mental health and it's starting to ruin what few real relationships I have left (if there are any to begin with).

I know some of you secretly want to be famous or crave recognition from masses of people, but as someone who has quite a fanbase, let me tell you right now that... you really don't. It won't magically solve whatever problems you have; chances are it will just make them even worse.

I'm still this lonely husk of a person who has no real friends and basically zero social skills and trying to use my online fame to make up for it. Which it really doesn't. There's still a gaping hole in my heart that can only be filled with something real and genuine, and not with fake internet points and comments from random strangers.

Am i going to find a way of freeing myself? I don't think so. I am worthless and should have died a long time ago but now I'm too scared to do anything. I could never do that because I cared a lot about the people in my life even when none of them care about me. I'm a coward. I'm a coward. I'm a coward. For some stupid reason I thought I could be happy but I was so wrong. Some of us dont deserve happiness and we have to deal with it as if we really wanted to live. I was so naive for thinking anyone would care about me in any way. I'm worthless and I should act like that no matter what I want.",lonely,Who cares,2020-06-15 00:11:22

1600,Fish_Single,1592125079,1,"its so  hard to explain the way i am;

i hate everyone and everything;

&amp;#x200B;

i dont even know where to begin tbh..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i'll start with college i guess;

&amp;#x200B;

last week, i had this class im the most worried about (its not horrible, but i want to get the bare minimum; other than that im good); i studied; well, ngl, i didn't work that hard, only like an hour before the class (online obviously)...

its easy to cheat too, google shit when you're asked questions; i did pretty good, only missed like 2 questions; i felt so good, cuz again, there are like only 3 classes left till the exam, and im trying to get all the grades. intentionally didn't check what i got that day, just checked it yesterday night, and it was wayyy below what i deserved;

its not even that that bitch hates me or anything, but she gives those types of grades to everyone for some reason; i dont get it; i really dont;

it kills my motivation; i mean, i got no other choice to study, cuz as i said, the semester is ending; but that shit has fucked me up so much; 

it makes me think violent and nihilistic; 

&amp;#x200B;

my college life in general is stupid asf too; at first it was amazing, met lots of people, had fun and shit, like it was how it was supposed to be, but in like a month, i started to get more and more passive; until, i cut all the ties with everyone;

i didn't find any of those relationships fulfilling; im pretty social, and used to talk to everyone; well i still  do, or when i'll see them in real life i will (don't use social media currently) but no close ties, which i actually need the most;

not only that, as i said, i fucking started to hate people there; i hate how people look out for each other, care for each other, hit each other up, wait for each other, cuz i haven't had it in a while; and it kinda fucks me up even more;

and honestly, i'm going still pretty good, considering the fact that i've been a complete loner for like 2 years. fell out with my school friends, right before the last year there, they were people who i used to go out with, but anyways...

its not even about them, its just that i want people like that in my life, i mean, everyone needs it;

&amp;#x200B;

i wish i didn't feel like a fucking creep whenever i checked her instagram; literally, i do it everyday; now that its private the only thing i can see is her profile pic change;

oh and no, its not my crush; yeah, i know it sounds weird; it def is someone i like, and she even liked me back, but the thing is, i think its not even about her, but i just want to be with someone, or i want somebody to love;

i love her, well the way she looks and is in my head; but in real life, i just get disappointed everytime i see her (well not anymore). 

it drives me crazy; it has caused me to be insane;

i wish i could see her again at least once, so the feeling could go away;

the thing is that it has happened a lot already, have been away from her, feelings brew up and shit, insta pics dont help too (cuz she looks perfect there (i mean everyone does, duh...)) and then i see her and i  regret even giving her a single shit...

i know that its gonna happen again; but whatever, i cant help;

another fear i started to have is that she might not like me anymore, but again, it won't be relevant, cuz i'll ""meh"" her in real life; and that sucks, as i said.. i will regret all of this, this thinking....

its so weird how it happens too, like, after seeing her IRL, in a snap;

its weird;

&amp;#x200B;

but fuck everything right?

now, another problem;

i literally hate everyone;;

like i mean everyone;

i want to fuck everyone up, cuz of my ego;

i want to be the best; i am one tbh;

fuck others;

i will make everyone suck my dick;

&amp;#x200B;

tf am i even saying...

&amp;#x200B;

but anyways, considering all of this, how tf am i supposed to study tho;

i just want to get thru this fucking semester and that's it...

i hope i will;

but then what? lonely summer? what, its been like 2 summers already, like that;

not going out and shit;

fuck everyone;;

&amp;#x200B;

oh, and cherry on top;

i even started to have some body issues;

well, i got issues about my face to be more precise; (just for the record; i've been called attractive, like exceptionally, but the things i fixate on, i dont even know if they're relevant or not, like are they even there, or is it just in my fucking head?)

i hate it, well sometimes i feeel like a god, sometimes like an ogre

it's one of the reason why i fight with my parents all the time too, when i feel ugly i dont feel like talking; and whenever they force me, i fucking hate it, it always goes down to insulting each other;

&amp;#x200B;

fuxk

what do i do?

&amp;#x200B;

im rotting at home...

well, now another thing hit me too..

knowing that others are living their lives is fucking me up too, knowing that they travel, do shit, i dunno, have fun with their friends...

it fucks me up even more..

Not their real name so I won't get anyone on his ass, So when we first met I was a really emotional person I cried on our first day being friends. They comforted me and was really nice and open, opened to their problems, I was nice to them, was open, really kind, but shy. (Now I'm a little more confident with online talking thanks the lord) We had a great few months as friends. We were nice made corny sex jokes, laughed about cringey things mostly Brad made me feel comfortable around people which I was terrified of people and terrified of the things on the internet, but this person made me more comfortale and less awkward if you'd say.

So One day, he was accused and charged for things, Admitted to the things but never in jail, had good lawyers since he was a rich kid and paid them good fucking money. But, I was never in the accusers side or Brads side, I was in the middle, Brad did admit the things so he does derserve a week of jail time or something but at the same time, the accusers made up fake stuff, so they both were at fault. I told Brad, Everything would be okay because I knew he had some strong in him, and I stood there by his side, I never went against him but coached him a little he stood there, but a busy man.. I was just confused why he wouldn't talk to me, I helped him, defended him, and went into serious trouble, I gave him praise and shit and all I got was a.. ""Thank you! so much but you should'nt have..""

I told him many times I do this because I appreciate and love all my friends and they don't need to repay me or do anything to owe me back, but he.. He sat there let me fight his problems as he smoked weed, have sex with random friends in his school parking lot in his car, a TESLA (His dad owns it but let the kid stroll around) let you know, Brad is 18, turning 19, yet he is so immature of his things and let people do his dirty work, AKA me! then strolls around saying sorry for not being there for me and other junk, things he don't actually fucking mean.. He promised to meet me and promised that he would be there, but I knew it was an lie to have my hopes so high that they couldn't come down, I felt manipulated and lied to and yelled at him.

I told him how much our one sided friendship is, he said one word, sorry. I went on with my rant telling him our bond was never like before because he had a car crash last year (Not real to be exact) and Changed his whole ""Perspective on things"" But acted like the victim when he was charged and accused, but the charges dropped and the accusers were never heard again from the platform we were on, I still talk to brad but called me two faced and fake saying That I'm on a fitered mask, he was the one to encourage me to change and calls me names and slurs.

1618,normallysoggy,1592115208,1,"Hi, so I just needed a place to vent. I‚Äôm finally a senior at a great college in LA. I have a high GPA and am in STEM. I‚Äôve proven a few new theorems in research and am looking to go to graduate school. I‚Äôm slotted to commission as an officer in the military and graduate with high distinctions (honor society, hopefully valedictorian, etc). I‚Äôm fit and not bad looking, making decent money, and consider myself to be funny. I don‚Äôt like to brag, but I just wanted to share how I am doing pretty well in life and tend to meet a lot of people.

I broke up with my girlfriend because I felt unhappy and didn‚Äôt want to string her along. Nothing was wrong and she was happy in the relationship. So me doing that really hurt her and it hurts me still. 

I‚Äôve lost all my friends from high school when I went to college because I‚Äôm actually from another state. I‚Äôve tried keeping up with them, but they stopped responding.

I made many ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in freshman year. But because I didn‚Äôt join a frat or club, I lost 99% of them. I really only have three people at the end of the day. Yes, I am introverted, but I enjoy people. 

I decided to delete my social media because it was making me unhappy (recent events, fantasy lives, etc). Since quarantine in March, I have not seen a single person outside of my family as I was displaced back out of my college state. 

Where I used to be passionate about fitness, I am now struggling to motivate myself. Where I used to eat well, I now eat little. I‚Äôm unemployed and still searching for jobs, so I‚Äôm depressed and antsy. I try to help around the house and spend time with family, but even that has its limits of fulfillment.

I feel more displaced, distanced, and disengaged from anyone and anything. I don‚Äôt have many people to talk to as my three friends rarely respond now. Social media never helped with this, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the cause...I really didn‚Äôt lose any friends from deleting it.

I enjoy fashion, fitness, and exploring. And it is a struggle to do any of those right now. I have to save my money, I struggle to motivate myself, and COVID-19 makes it risky/illegal to explore places.

I don‚Äôt know how to fix my loneliness and unhappiness with life. I am thankful for where I have worked to be: no college debt, nice car, great quality of life. But I‚Äôm missing people and have no motivation or means to meet more.

EDIT: I really should use my post to help others. If you‚Äôre discontent with where you are in life, just know that the grass is always greener on the other side. I should technically have no reason to be discontent with my life. Things are going ‚Äúwell.‚Äù But even these good things may not make you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù better. I recognize my problem is that I need people...I have been hurt a few times (strung along twice). However, I just struggle to find them. So if you feel bad about your body, job, current situation, just know that success may not necessarily make you feel better; it‚Äôs people. But yeah...I‚Äôm lonely myself, so, can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve fixed that issue.",lonely,Broke up with girlfriend and becoming more recluse...,2020-06-14 16:13:28

So I was already lonely right? But then this quarantine stuff happened and I realized everybody I knew somehow still didn‚Äôt feel lonely. Then I lost my job.

1623,flamingindecision,1592113430,1,"I know I'm in a lot better place than some of you on here, so I want to preface this by saying I am really sympathetic towards the people who have absolutely no one and I am grateful for the relationships I do have. (also sorry for the super long post lol)

I have some great friends from high school who I am still in touch with, but they've all moved away and so we only talk through text and the occasional phone/video call. I just graduated college and didn't make a single close friend throughout it. It was devastating. I was actually relieved the COVID thing happened and my ceremony got moved online so I didn't just have to go with my family and no friends to take pictures with and such.

I did make a few friends in college, but no one I saw more than a few times a year. The people I did connect with I tried really hard to become closer to - always reaching out to them and trying to make plans. Usually they were too busy for me because I was more of a secondary (or even tertiary) friend to them, so even though I'd repeatedly (once every few weeks) text and make an effort to hang out, they'd have some reason they couldn't. When we did make plans they'd often flake out at the last minute. I've pretty much given up on those ""friends"" because I'm tired of being the only one reaching out and usually being rejected. I don't think they understand that they're the closest friends I have since I'm not in their main group. I think they assume I have some other group I'm a part of. Either that or they just don't care.

I have a boyfriend, we've been in a relationship for about 4.5 years and I love him very much, but he's in the same boat as me. A couple friends from high school who he rarely sees and no new close friends. He's my lifeline right now, the only person I see besides my immediate family who I live with. If I ever wanted to leave the relationship I don't think I could because he is the only person my age who I have any face to face contact with.

I am becoming so discouraged and lonely that it hurts. I feel like I've lost the ability to make friends or even have a conversation. I know that's not true because I made a friend I really connected with while studying abroad 2 years ago, we've even visited each other (we live in different states) a few times since then. *I just can't seem to become friends with anyone who actually lives near me.* I'm naturally very quiet and shy and have an anxiety disorder. After not being able to make a close friend for so long these traits/issues have become exacerbated and I feel like my problem is just getting worse and worse.

I'm not really looking for advice, just needed a place to vent and maybe some sympathy from people who are going through something similar.

TL;DR I have some friends from high school who are all out of state and I have a boyfriend, but can't seem to make any new friends locally. Feeling broken and like I'm never going to have a close friendship again because of my shyness/quietness and failure at making friends for the past 4 years.",lonely,No local friends... the ones I do have will not hang out with me no matter how hard I try.

I remember my first graduation...I had friends but I felt alone, like an outcast the whole time I was there. Then graduation from high school, I had friends but I still felt the same way.

I'm currently in the second year of university. I don't really have any friends in my faculty. The few people I know I wouldn't call friends. I rarely see them and we don't ever hang out. People who I would consider my friends are in different faculties from me. Since my school does graduation by faculty, I won't graduate on the same day as them.

I know many of my insecurities stem from childhood and the issues hung around even through college; that infinitely makes the situation harder to navigate.  In a nutshell, people just don't want to be my friend; it's not a conscious decision.  It's more like not being thought of when people sit down for a group call or going out to grab boba.

Group/peer dynamics have changed a lot over the last decade or so.  I've been told by a lot of people that I'm a good friend.  Maybe so... but none of them think of me.  Growing up, and even throughout adulthood, I was bullied.  A lot.  People were just awful, people pretended to be my friend while talking shit about me, and I ended an abusive relationship last year.

My brother has done a lot for me in terms pf paying for things or helping me grow my work portfolio so my mom thinks whatever hes doing is just right. but when hes mean its SO mean I literally feel so sad and lost. It has beeen seriously really tough on me. My entire family also very controlling I have strict curfews of being home before sunset, Im often told off if I wear anything above my ankle or tuck in my shirt and basically everyone just tells me what to do constantly in a way thats just not nice. On top of that my dad moved back to us and he only talks to me when he wants to get work done and constantly just asks me until i do it even though i tell him itll take time. My mom just always says something to put me down, same with my brother and if im mad about it my brother always says ‚Äúyes go sit in ur room for an entire day and cry‚Äù and even calls me ‚Äúconartist‚Äù when i havent done anything.

1702,yeet_it_up,1592058095,5,"The last two years of high school I used to cry a lot from feelings of loneliness. At least once a week and sometimes every other night. I would cry hard and feel my chest ache. This lasted for about 2 years. I remeber my phone would go weeks without a single notification message from anyone.

I have essentially one friend and this person will be moving away at the end of the year. There are other people I know but I am too scared to reach out and too ashamed because, among other things, I fail like a failure.

I didn't perform well enough in high school to get into University directly so I had to take an alternative path. I failed that and had to take it a second time to pass. Now I am studying properly but have failed this semester, at least three out of my four units, so I will have to re-do it.

I live with my brother and I constantly feel anxious around him because he regularly insults me. I stay in my room most of the time because I am scared of him. What he's thinking of me or what he might say about me. I'll go hungry to avoid going into the kitchen where he might be. I have to work up courage to walk past him. When I'm home alone, I'll freeze up when I hear a car drive past and listen to see if it's him pulling into the drive way. I'll make it look like I am doing something productive when he walks in so he doesn't call me an idiot.

I try to think of Stoicism and be objective about my life and this helps a little.

\- Being alone and being sad are only linked in your mind. Being alone is not in itself sad, it's just your mind's thinking that makes it so.

\- You are only hurt by external influences if you allow yourself to be. You can choose not to be.

\- Think of the unfathomable amount of time that has past and the infinite furture ahead. Your life is beyond microscopic and your problems even more so. There is no point in becoming obsessed or stressed about such tiny concerns.

\- etc. etc...

Sometimes I go for a drive at night and listen to sad music. I don't know who to talk to so I guess this is how I cope. Before I would cry but because of the Lexapro I have been taking for a couple months now it is hard to. My friend is the only person I have told that I take Lexapro. I won't tell my brother because of what I said before and I won't tell my dad because my mum is already sick so I don't want to stress him out about me too.

My life in the long run looks scary. I don't have friends, people to talk to. I'm undisciplined. Lazy. I can't control my thoughts. I don't have a job (and I'm too scared of people to get one) or useful skills. I let people down. I have to muster up confidence just to leave the house. I don't know how to handle my brother. I don't know how to tell my dad I failed my studies. I want relationships but I hate myself so I hide. I'm ugly. I'm stupid.

1724,AlternateUser12,1592036597,12,"I don't know what to do at this point. I feel this deep pit in myself and I don't know how to dig myself out of it this time. So much of my loneliness feels attributed to just my location. Small college town that is mostly agricultural based in the midwest, and the majority of people are as you'd expect. The town also has little to offer in terms of indulging in hobbies or interests. My only friend locally is my roommate, all others are cities away. I don't meet many people that I get along with on more than a surface level via classes or my work, let alone finding someone with the same interests or passions.

I'm 23 with a year left in college. Two of these four so far were spent with the girl I thought I'd marry. We were very happy, until she wasn't. We talk now, after about a year and a half later. She apologized for everything she did and owns up to it. There was a point where I entertained getting back together, but realized I just can't see her the same way anymore after what she said to me when she left, and what she did as soon as we broke up. I can tell she still loves me and misses me, but I don't even find her physically attractive anymore. I'm not sure if it's just my taste has changed, or if it's because I'll never be able to see her with warmth again. She threw us away and I don't think that can ever be undone, as much as I'd love to have that relationship again; just not with her.

We were on the same page on just about every facet. And while I'm over her, I'm not over what I had; unconditional love and a comfortable relationship. I've dated and seen other people since then. But nobody comes close. I attract very nice and pretty girls, which while might sound like an arrogant brag, is honestly the most painful part of this. We never have anything in common. No hobbies, dreams, pursuits of any kind come close. I'm frustrated with dating that feels like it's constantly going out to bars every weekend when I just want the comforts of a partner again. To share a room and not have to say a word but to be content, to do two separate things together in the same space, with anecdotes thrown in. To know that we are both comfortable at our laziest, and there not to be any expectation to entertain, but to be entertained simply in the company of each other. But that requires commonality, and it feels like I don't have any with most women that are interested in me.

I guess that's it. I realized while typing the end of that last paragraph. ""Interested in me"". I'm so interested in romance and partnership but I don't meet anyone that piques my interest anymore. Sometimes I worry that my box is too narrow to be checked. Friends have assured me I'm not asking for anything crazy. I've tried dating outside my general ""requirements"", but then I end up in a situation with one-sided feelings that I don't end up returning. I'm hoping it's just my locale, and once I leave school I'll be in a different city with more diverse people. For the next year though, I'm going to be stuck here grinding away at my degree, feeling broken for not being able to develop feelings like I have before.

Then I meet other couples, and they don't even seem happy. Coworkers going on about how their partners upset them or irritate them. It makes the idea of finding genuine love a needle in a haystack of people just otherwise settling.",lonely,Love feels like such a rare commodity at this point,2020-06-13 18:23:17
1725,jdhgideon,1592036381,1,"Everyone I grew up with are gone. One by one, I lose a friend over the years; due to circumstance, incompatibility, or disinterest. I've nobody left. 

I've been lonely my entire life. I started writing music as solace, and my advent with it kept me warm in a cold world, and, eventually, took me to self-actualizing myself. But I can only express solitude and use it as motivation to write music for so long. For 11 years, this is what I've done, and I've made incredible strides I never dreamt I could.

I'm an introvert, and thank God I am, because if I was extroverted, I couldn't imagine how I could possibly survive. I enjoy my time alone, and when I have company, I like to really connect with people on a deep level. My closest friends I've made by important, intimate relationships, but they've all disappeared. Circumstance had taken my closest friends, friends who were meant to be, from me. Those who weren't, I had let go.

Sometimes I see old friends still together on social media, after years and years. I envy those who have kept close friends since childhood. Everyone I know has someone. I am wreathed by jealousy. I envy those who stick together. I'm now in my mid 20's, with nobody to call mine. Nobody to say I've emotionally invested in for many years. Nobody I can say that have been by my side and I theirs for years. Nobody to call me out when I've done something wrong. Nobody to share with what I cherish. I've never kissed a girl. Physically, I'm not attractive at all. Maybe a bit on the inside too.

For years, I took a very concentrated effort to learn about who I am, and what I could improve. I used to be a control freak, and it contributed heavily to my panic attacks, which I have now fully conquered. I had improved every aspect of my life, yet the one thing social science tells me that keeps a person happy eludes me. 

Maybe you ought to say I'm blaming something outside my control, and the easiest answer to my lonesome is to blame myself, and perhaps you'd be right... but every case so far has been peculiar; if there is that one unlucky individual.

It's torture. Waves of loneliness flood my being and I drown in it, left to claw for air while I suffocate in solitude, as my breath bubbles to the surface, there's nobody around to hear it. What have I done? There has always been a cause for my depression, and I have always been able to conquer it... but this one?

I just look at myself and all I see is disappointment, never talked to a girl more than 5 minutes, pretty sure won't ever have a girlfriend because how ugly my face looks, got a personality of a rock. I finished locksmith school and my dad has never been disappointed in me than the time I was born, like no joke, I remember hearing my mother tell a story to my grandmother, saying when she was pregnant with me, my dad told her ""Why are we having a third child"". I never paid attention to my father's ""love"" for me before, but when I heard my mother say that,it all came clear to me why my father was always more aggressive towards me than my brother and sister, now everyday I isolate myself from my family, and a couple of online friends I have. Just wish I had someone who was like me, who I could talk to about video games, anime, movies, tv shows, talk to someone who would not immediately judge me how I look, make fun of me for what school I finished. Even my online friends make fun me, but I know they're joking, even I join in and make fun of myself, but sometimes when I'm alone in my room I think to myself ""Were they even joking?"".

My Facebook ‚Äúfriend‚Äù list has under 30 people. Some are people who knew me from school, some from previous workplaces and some being people who want to nosey through my photos but wouldn‚Äôt even give me the time of day if they saw me in the street. I went through a really traumatic experience whilst at college and people i considered to be friends pretty much disappeared overnight at a time where I really needed support. I would spend lunch breaks alone because I literally had no one around. Classes that I was really enthusiastic about and enjoyed I soon failed at because I just didn‚Äôt want to be there anymore so I left college with no grades above an E grade. I went into the world of work and discovered how office people (especially older women) could be so cruel and make me feel miserable just because of my age and lack of experience. Every workplace I‚Äôve been in has had at least 1 person who has enjoyed making me feel miserable as a fun pastime. I‚Äôve tried all sorts of techniques and tricks to form friendships but never seemed be anyone‚Äôs 1st choice. When I‚Äôve tried to arrange a Meetup or fun event people always seemed to have better places to be. Times where I thought I‚Äôd built trust and friendship with someone always turned out to be superficial and I was easily forgotten in a short space of time. My trust for other human being has just dwindled away. The years have zoomed passed and I‚Äôve realised that making friends from scratch in your late 20s early 30s is a near impossible task and I feel sad to think that for milestone birthdays such as my 21st, 25th and 30th I‚Äôve done nothing to celebrate because I‚Äôve had no mates since leaving school.
I have my wonderful fianc√© and I‚Äôm so grateful to have him in my life but I can‚Äôt help but feel a horrible sad ache in my stomach when he‚Äôs having catchups with at least 3 friends (most recently via zoom) where they talk about their work day, what‚Äôs going on in their lives etc and check in on eachother when I have nobody who even thinks of me. I was recently admitted to hospital and whilst lying in the bed scared of all the injections and feeling alone coz I couldn‚Äôt see anyone I knew that if the COVID situation didnt exist still I would have had no visitors. The lockdown changed absolutely nothing for me. I still tried to think of others and sent messages to people wishing them well and hoping they were ok but got nothing in return. I have less than 10 contacts in my phone now and the majority are drs, dentist or businesses. I think of and reach out to people to say hi, ask how they‚Äôre doing but i mostly get no response and I certainty don‚Äôt get out of the blue messages from someone thinking of me. We‚Äôve all got lives and I‚Äôve never demanded to be someone‚Äôs number 1 priority but I don‚Äôt even occur as a moments thought to anybody. No text or call to say how are you, what‚Äôve you been up to, what‚Äôs on your mind. I scroll through Facebook daily and my news feed is 99% DIY craft idea pages or other random videos and I find myself wondering why I‚Äôm even on social media. I‚Äôve tried telling myself it‚Äôs to ‚Äúkeep connected / keep in contact with people‚Äù but the reality is that I‚Äôve been friendless for nearly 15 years and that‚Äôs now set in stone. I‚Äôm engaged to be married which I‚Äôm happy about but at the same time I know I will feel embarrassed at the wedding as I will have no one other than my small family to attend and I have no best friends to even ask to be my bridesmaids whereas my fianc√© already has at least 5 friends he wants as groomsmen. I‚Äôm not even going to be able to have a hen do because I have no one to invite. 
Loneliness is a big problem for me and so having a Facebook account seems pointless and only makes me feel worse.

I have 1 person who makes me feel like a priority and I don‚Äôt need social media to spend time with him or show him how grateful I am that he‚Äôs in my life.

I really don‚Äôt want anything from anyone anymore but please at least think of that person that you don‚Äôt hear from anymore, sending them a random text asking How they are doing may just make their day and mean so much more to them than you realise.",lonely,Loneliness is a killer.,2020-06-12 23:32:58

I've got some head issues I'm very open about that people still don't seem to understand. I'm in love. Again. But someone different that's better than the rest like everyone else that's better than someone different. I don't even believe in that shit. I just don't want to be alone and I manifest it.

I've learned that everyone I know that acts like they like me really just thinks that I'll fuck them eventually because I'm pretty pathetic and not the most horrible thing to look at. It's been a hard realization but couldn't have come at a more perfect time since I can't hang out with anyone anyway with C19 going around. I don't really know what I'm going to do now.

I don't want to be alone and it sucks because everyone always tells me how great I am before they spent much time with me. So how do I be great all the time? And not get old to someone immediately? How do I be myself and not too much at the same time? It's one of those I want to blame everyone else but I know it's me things. And I don't know how to change who I actually am. And I know that everyone says you should be yourself and people will love you for that but can't love you if you're not, but people can't love me for what I am. Not for long anyway. And I really just can't fathom living forever this way. Like maybe I should start making friends online and not real life? Maybe distance between me and others would make it easier to accept me?

I am using my anonymous account because I am scared of you finding me here even though you probably don't use reddit.

I met you online, we became friends despite the fact that we are miles apart. 

Sometimes you let your poor mental health get the best of you, you can get angry at me sometimes for things I never did, but you understand what your problems are and every day I see you improve even more.

In the past year you have grown so much as a person, you have become happier, you have nearly totslly overcome your anger issues, and we have become much closer friends, but lately I am beginning to feel conflicted about you.

I am beginning to like you. romantically speaking. and I just have no idea why.

You're a good friend, you're cute, but you also still have your issues that can be too much to deal with sometimes and I sometimes feel like the conversation we are having could go south at any moment

I feel like our friendship occasionally gets rocky and I find that you tend to bottle up your emotions and act defensive only to pour them out when I ask what is wrong. I feel like I shouldn't feel this way about you.

But I like you alot. I really do like you, and I have no idea why.

On one hand it makes me scared. I don't know what is happening in my brain, I don't know what I see in you, its terrifying to even think of the way you make me feel

On the other hand every time I think about you and visualize your face in my head my heart skips a beat and I can't help but just get red faced and flustered, despite being totally alone.

I think I might be starting to love you and the thought of it makes me more terrified than anything else in my life.

part of me doesn't want to love you. part of me wants to forget I ever met you and run away, I'm so panicked.

and another part of me is just praying that you love me back.

why do I love you? and why am I so scared of loving you?

I don't understand it. I just don't.

The last time I had a best friend was probably in middle school. In high school I would be by myself doing my own thing and other days I would be with different groups of people.

I was always so lonely just seeing people hangout with their friends and living life on social media. I will never know how that feels like and it was hard for me to make friends because I just didn't connect with people a whole lot. The only time I would socialize was during school and I would always be home. Making friends out of college is hard and I don't understand why! I do my best to always find hope and I always end up losing it cuz everytime I meet someone great I would be the only one initiating the conversation. I'm not a mean person and I do my best to listen to people. Most of my friendships was always a one way thing where I would always ask to hang and it just hurts because I question what is wrong with me? My close friend in middle school would always be on her phone texting people but would take hours replying to me I feel like I should not live because this has always been a constant thing even during college. People seem so quick to make friends easy and im just here feeling like I don't exist. I would try to hang with coworkers but they always were so fake gossiping all the time.. I would go to dance classes and I would end up talking to a few people and as soon as class was over they would rush home and same thing happened at a youth group. Being in a relationship is so hard because he always talks about ""the boys"" and how happy he is with them and of course im happy for him but its 1000 times harder in a relationship to not have anyone else but him. My only genuine friend lives in New York and its harder to see her with the pandemic. Why is it so hard to make my friends? I literally always have suicial thoughts because of this.. im tired of people being so fake, only caring about social media and only talking to me when they need something. The advice that I always get is everything I have been doing and nothing has happened... im tired of struggling like this. I'm 19, live in Southern California and a girl that has more in common with guys then girls.. I always connected with guys but I would love to make girl friends :/ it just never works out. Life just feels so lonely... especially on holidays no one ever wishes me a happy birthday or happy new years.. I wish people thought of me.. or at least cared. Been going through this for 8 years and I dont know how long I can go living like this.another thing that happened recently was the only person that was ever close to me was my cousin we were close since we were 4.. and my mom and boyfriend told me that she has been saying awful things behind my back.. what did I do to deserve all of this its painful. Guys would always try to hit on me in middle school and high school would pretend to be my friend and then fuck me over.. I seriously can't trust anyone and I cant handle people anymore it is like people only do things for their personal gain.",lonely,Having no friends in a relationship is killing me,2020-06-12 15:02:31

But of course there's the logical side of me that knows how that wouldn't last. Im too repressed and antisocial. My insecurities and my trauma of pain and rejection has made me desolate. I see my reflection and i despise what i see. 

I care too much and it has taken its toll on me, I've let myself go and I've learned to live in solitude. It makes more sense too just give up on what i know I'll never have.

I think a lot of my depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia stems from my family and the way they treat me. I forgot what it felt like to be so belittled and undervalued.

I have two other siblings, whom my parents adore. I never had my own room, but at least before I have somewhere to sleep.

My parents always say if I don‚Äôt like it I can leave because they have no reason to put up with it. They always take my siblings‚Äô side and they all gang up on me to mentally abuse me. Their mind games consist of: being passive aggressive, purposefully giving me all the chores, name calling, refusing to talk to me and even acting as if I‚Äôm not present, teasing me amongst each other while I‚Äôm right in front of them, or talking about me (loudly) from other rooms.

The only thing that helps I guess is just sometimes seeing a funny or loving post on reddit or drowning myself with a bunch of YouTube videos. For a split second I forget how lonely and sad I am. Then I remember how I have nobody close to me and how I have nobody that cares about me. And it hurts. I just wish to have people or just one person that cares for me as much as I care for them. I just want someone to love and for that person to love me.

A few nights ago, I had a dream where I had a fun supportive group of friends but when I woke up I remembered that I really have nobody. All my family do their own things. They all have their own groups of friends. While the 3 friends that I do have, they have their own lives and are busy. And I probably only have 2 friends because my best friend and I got into another fight and we don‚Äôt talk anymore. Then my another friend is honestly sometimes kinda a dick to me. And my third friend is busy with school and we haven‚Äôt talked in a few days.


It just hurts so much being alone. Before I had school to distract me but since the lockdown the work load has been a lot less so I had time to reflect on how lonely I am. And now schools basically over so all I have is time to see how lonely I am. And how I have accomplished nothing. I just hate myself. I hate how l look. I hate my mental illness. I hate how I deal with anything difficult. I‚Äôm just a worthless person. I was given everything needed to succeed but all I am is a lazy piece of shit. And all I do is whine about my situation. I‚Äôm just tired.

But I keep on hoping and imagining that in the future I would be happy, and not lonely. I daydream a lot that in the future I would have a close group of nice friends. That I would have somebody or someone to love me and for me for love them back. But it is all just imagination. It is just a dream.

One wrong move or word can make everything collapse within seconds. It‚Äôs like a boomerang, the wrong things you say to someone come back to you. 

Our lives can be different or similar, in my case it‚Äôs different from everyone else. Which means it‚Äôs hard for me to relate to something with friends because I never experienced the adventures they had. 

My mood swings are unbearable, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have time to talk with you or anyone in general. I just can‚Äôt find the joy and motivation to put the effort into doing it. I‚Äôm stuck in one place and yet can‚Äôt find the right path out of it unless I move away and start off fresh. Which I can‚Äôt do until I turn 18. 

No one can understand what goes on in my brain even if I tried to explain myself. Which is why I gave up on telling people how I actually felt and became cautious with myself.

I had the nicest dream last night that's just left me with an ache all day, and I wonder if anyone ever experiences the same, and I also just really want someone to tell who will understand.

In the dream, there was a woman who I don't know in real life but in the dream, I had a deep connection to and had known for some time. In the dream I knew that this woman knew me, like KNEW me knew me, and we were bonded by the intimacy of understanding all of one another's feelings, ambitions, sadnesses, and shared dreams we were determined to make reality - a true soul partner, practically the same person. She had written a song about her feelings for me and we timidly expressed our love for each other, even though there were no physiologically sensations of romance or sexuality through the course of the dream. Again, just a deep feeling of a more pure love, and trust, and knowing.

Before the dream ended, we were together in my favorite European city that only in the dream state would I ever live in (since awake the thought of living there is so far-fetched I don't even dare day dream about it), but we were there in that beautiful place looking for jobs to make our dreams come true, together.

All day, I've been so sad thinking about that person and that feeling, like it physically hurts. I know it sounds mostly like a fairy tale and these things don't really exist, but:

1. Dream-woman, if you exist, I'll keep looking for you. My heart reaches out to you.
2. I hope everyone on this sub finds their own soul partner one day - I'll be praying and thinking of you all as we continue on this journey of life together.",lonely,Do you ever find the people you need in your dreams?,2020-06-12 04:37:39

‚Äî so then why doesnt he do it for me?

The thing that triggered me was this: I've noticed something about me when I was taking a driving lesson today. The driving session was 1.5 hours. I've noticed that I can control the car pretty well for like 30 minutes. Then my driving instructor corrected me about my clutch/acceleration control. It's perfectly normal, it's his job. The real problem with me is that when I take criticism I always seem to lose my control and my brain completely shuts down. It feels like a fog up there. I can't seem to think properly. My vision is getting way smaller. I immediately feel some sort of strange anger for him (I absolutely don't understand this...he's just doing what he's supposed to do). I seriously think it might just be my extreme ambition or i'm just a typical narcissist. And this is not the only example I can give. I've failed plenty of exams in college because I couldn't take criticism from my teachers. I begin to talk about the given subject and when he corrects me I completely lose (again, brain fog) my ideas and fail to remember what I've studied for this exam. My girlfriend left me a year ago for something similar. I haven't gotten in any relationship since I know that I'm not normal, psychologically speaking. Strange enough, I don't lose control or temper or get angry when someone corrected my lat pulldown form at the gym. It might just be that I get really fired up in a stressful environment?

I've come to realize that my childhood might have something to do with this. I was raised by my grandparents until I turned 7 because my parents we're working on their careers. My grandfather also had this strange temperament issue and was sort of abusive to my grandmother...and a bit misogynistic might I add. Didn't really had any bonding moments with my father even though I still live under his roof at 23. My mind...somehow made grandpa a bigger father figure than my father. I fear that I might have gotten those horrible attributes from him.

I am a 25 year old male. I‚Äôve been struggling with a lot of anxiety and depression over this last year. I try my hardest to respect women of all kind. Yes my ego is very fragile I admit that. During this quarantine I did something that I thought I would never do. I was paying for onlyfans and snapchat premiums from random women. During that time it seemed fitting to wallow in depression and pity. I could get very down on myself at times. Now coming out of it, I realize that was a very embarrassing decision and I‚Äôm ashamed of it. I used to look down on that stuff but here I did it and I‚Äôm so ashamed. I feel like a ‚Äúloser‚Äù ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù ‚Äúcreep‚Äù all in one! I love the women of my family and respect them. My girl cousins and nieces look up to me. I‚Äôm so disgusted with myself, it‚Äôs a constant battle within everyday with that decision. If I were to tell a woman I did that, she would be freaked out! My family/friends would be disgusted. Feel like I‚Äôm always making dumb decisions as a man and really trying to limit that.

I‚Äôve told a couple of my female friends and even my twin sister. And they keep telling me it‚Äôs more to life then stressing over some stuff like that.

1899,micrawave,1591864173,2,"Hi all,

I just want to hear from those of you who have found a way to live their life happily and anyone else who might sympathsize. Right now I am overcome both by my loneliness, which has persisted for most of my life (I am now 31), and my regret for losing so many opportunities to change it. I'd really appreciate hearing from someone who has improved their life--or, well, anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why I ask: I'm more alone right now than I ever have felt. I've got some colleagues from my graduate school (I'm a student) that I can sometimes text,  but we are not at all close. And I've got my mom, but I am otherwise alone.

I was in a six-year-long relationship, which was almost entirely long-distance. My partner was also my best friend and counselor; I did not cultivate other relationships and largely found my work (the reason I was long-distance) unsatisfying. My partner would often tell me that I needed more friends, that I needed to work on being happy independent of her, and that I was just demanding too much from her. As she pulled away from me and made new friends, I couldn't do similarly. During the lockdown, she largely ceased talking to me and has ended our relationship. In her absence, I was devastated to learn just how small my world was, and how little I had to make me happy in it. I've definitely had some dark thoughts, deepened by the lockdown, about just not wanting to continue like this if all I have to look forward to is this isolation and feeling of failure.

So while I know the problem I'm now confronting is exactly what my partner warned me about--that I was never happy with anything but her, and wasn't vulnerable enough to make relationships and take career risks--I'm now totally in that dark place alone. I want to know if anyone has been able to escape this, because I feel pretty hopeless.",lonely,Has anyone turned their life around? (31 m),2020-06-11 18:29:33

To me it feels like my life is just on a giant pause, I cant help be jealous and envy about everyone who's progressed so much in their lives and i had to hit the reset button on mine. I spend MOST of my time alone due to work schedules and everything being completely different most of my friends.

We dated for  about 4-5 months and honestly,  I miss him (or I miss the him that I got to know in the beginning) and yes, I did have strong feelings for him.  But ONE of our biggest issues was sexual activity.  In the beginning, he initiated all the sexual activity, from conversations about our positions and disclosing the secret that he used sex toys to initiating our first time. After 3 months, sexual activity decreased and claimed he had a low sex drive and soon began to reject/deny all my advances. This utterly confused me and made me unhappy and led to the demise of our relationship.

So here I am, weeks later, already back on grindr. And it sucks! I've recently started having encounters with men again (only letting them blow me) because I've been trying to ease my way back into things.  But, I can't help but feel disgusted or upset with myself after its done.

For the past 2 months I‚Äôve been sober but before that I was on something every single day. I spent thousands of dollars on drugs and ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to get nothing out of it. I told my best friend I was into her and got a block on everything instead of a birthday present like she said.

My thoughts are usually not this bad but tonight just sucked. I no longer want to talk to anyone to prevent myself from loving someone. I only let myself get attached to drugs now because drugs can‚Äôt hurt your feelings. Physical pain is nothing compared to mental torture. Though I may be sober for 2 months I can‚Äôt help myself, and tomorrow will break those 2 months.

1912,himynameiswhat0010,1591856786,11,"13 years ago I was a part of a cult (JW) I decided to leave because one of the rules of being a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness is that you aren‚Äôt allowed to do research about the religion outside of their own website literature. Anyways, I decided to take a peek and I found a ton scandals and law suites about them covering up child sex abuse cases and footage of them lying in front of the Supreme Court about their shunning practices and domestic violence cases committed by superiors. I found out how they were spending our donation money on lawyers to defend themselves, It was mind blowing. The religion was already oppressive and sexiest but I just accepted it so as not to lose my support system but after that day I couldn‚Äôt look at it the same. And I decided I wanted to leave. Another rule of the religion is that once you leave you lose everyone remaining in the religion. For me it was everyone I ever knew since I was a child including my immediate family. We haven‚Äôt spoken for 12 years. Rebuilding my life outside of the cult has been difficult. Everything I ever knew about the world was rendered useless now that I was out. But that‚Äôs what they want. They essentially hold your family and friends hostage until you ‚Äúrepent for your sins‚Äù and decide to return to the religion. Over my fkn dead body. Life has been lonely ever since. I have this deep sadness and an inner narrative that no one wants me, even though I know it‚Äôs not true it‚Äôs hard to shake the feeling that everyone around me is a choice away from completely shunning me again.

1917,idkanynameisok,1591854011,2,"Hi idk if this is an appropriate place to put this but I'm just gonna do it anyway. Im 17, about to turn 18 in the next few weeks. Im also about to be very very homeless. I dont have a car, or even a drivers driver's license i dont even know how to drive. I dont have a job or any friends except for my boyfriend and I've never really had many in the past anyway. Im also pretty ill and mentally unstable. Ive developed some intestinal issues that haven't been diagnosed and a few different mental health diagnosis. I have sciatic pain and swelling in my back on and off and I have issues feeding myself enough. My muscles are very weak and my legs shake when i walk down or up the stairs. Im constantly disassociating and always very confused. I have a very poor memory and im very sensitive and easily overwhelmed. I had to drop out of high school because of it and my adhd and ""insomnia"". I have my ged though. I regularly will sleep for twelve hours in a night and still wake up completely exhausted, sometimes more so than before i had slept. I have a therapist and a dietitian and i psychiatrist. Im on a few different medications for my mental health and an antibiotic for a skin infection i have right now. My immune system is very obviously weak as I had a sinus infection for several months and have given myself mono in the past. I know it sounds ridiculous but no one else had it and i go out of my way to avoid sharing drinks or touching people in general. I've been ""homeless"" on and off since i was 9 jumping from my dad's friend's houses, to family members, hotels, and even to my older sister's friend. I had finally moved back in with my father after four or five years of him going from group homes to psych hospitals and hotels. He's an alcoholic and a generally unstable person. His ex wife is not in the picture. My baby sister who is about to enter high school just got told she can't  return to the house she was staying at so she needs to live in our fathers house. Our older brother is moving in too so he can take care of her. There are only two bedrooms here and my dad is using one already.

So i need to leave. He didn't kick me out but there really is no room. If i stay here I'll also have to rely on my boyfriend to get me out because my father lives in a very small urbanish town and i cant get a job up here. I cant walk a mile to the nearest stores because I'm weak. I cant work in a grocery store because I have anxiety attacks while just shopping in them even if they're mostly empty of people. My father is a difficult person to live with and regularly gets drunk and tries to pick fights with me. It makes me want to die.

I wasn't raised. My father's ex wife was schizophrenic and shunned me when i upset her or whenever she felt like it. I haven't seen her in six years. I remember changing my sister's diapers and potty training her. I remember watching her show love to my sisters and purposefully ignoring me and speaking very poorly of me with my older sister. There isn't any family here. There aren't any friends either. I dont have anywhere to go or anyone to turn to. If an emergency shelter turns me away or if i happen to get into one and they make me leave once i turn 18 and refuse to help me then I'm on the streets by myself. My boyfriend can't house me his home life is a mess and he's still in school and doesn't have a job right now. My dad's going to give me some money before i leave but i don't know how much to even ask for or if it will even make a difference.

 I'm tired of fighting. Im tired of no place feeling like home. Im scared no where will ever feel like home. Im just a kid. I'm not ready to be by myself. But i already am and i haven't even left yet. He hasn't helped me with anything. I had to get my own insurance my own food stamps my own therapist and help. I had to push for help all by myself at 13 when i wanted to kill myself and he didn't even care. He didn't help me. I tried to do it four times and he didn't care. The second time i overdosed i was 14. He called me while i was in the psych hospital to tell me that he hadn't come check on me in the emergency room because he wanted me to suffer.

I didn't even live with him. The entire time i was fourteen hed talk to me about how he wanted to die and how he tried to kill himself this way and that way the other week and i begged him to get help over and over again. I didnt even live with him. He wouldn't call for weeks and he wouldn't answer the phone and every time i would be sure he had finally done it but then he'd come back and say he was arrested or he was in a psych hospital.

Im all by myself. Ive always been all by myself. And im tired of it. Im tired of fighting all by myself. Or having to figure it all out alone. My boyfriend is wonderful. Im not ungrateful. But my boyfriend can't raise me. He can't take care of me. Hes still just a kid too. Im still a child. Im so scared and i feel so alone. I dont know what to do. I wish i was still strong. I wish i still had it in me to try. But im so tired and its just so hard. Everytime i take a step forward i get pushed all the way back to the beginning. I thought i was getting a chance to heal. I feel like I'm waiting to be pushed off a cliff. Im not ready. Im still a kid. I still don't understand anything. I still dont know how to take care of myself, how to comfort myself. When i beg for help after being told over and over again that it will be given to me then suddenly there is silence. Where do i look for help when there is no help? Where do adults go when they're still children?",lonely,Im about to be homeless,2020-06-11 15:40:11

1925,AkiryaFudo,1591850380,6,"You may be thinking, ""if you have a boyfriend, why are you posting on the lonely sub?"" Well, here's the context.

My boyfriend is honestly the only friend and person I have to talk to. He's sweet, caring, and fun to talk to. He's a nerdy engineer student with introvert behavior. Of course, this leads people to reach out to him and ask to play games with him. They message him and hold long term conversations, something I rarely get. Even some that I was friends with but ended up ghosting me talk to him. 

I just dont understand. People have come and gone. Rarely does anyone stick around to talk to me. I know it's harder to make friends online so I try to not let it get to me in that aspect. But even those that I know irl dont bother with me. I stepped back and thought about what makes my boyfriend more likable than me. I decided to stop being negative from now on. It's not constant enough to make me toxic but it's something. 

The problem is that I have no one to show my improvement to. When I meet someone for the first time, I'm never negative anyway. And I'm still ghosted or left behind. I just dont understand. I hate that I'm jealous because I go out of my way to help others and show that I care. He barely does anything and people flock to him.

I wish I was likable to people. I know I shouldn't rely on others for validation but having a support system and friends rooting for you would make my self esteem rise so much.

I am a 20M soon to be 21 and all my life I have been single. I have never dated anyone nor have I ever had my first kiss. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I felt human touch.

I have friends but I never feel like I‚Äôm with them. Whenever we are all together I still feel alone. In fact sometimes whenever I‚Äôm in their presence I feel even worse because they all have pretty great relationships. It sucks being single and lonely.

Occasionally I can‚Äôt sleep at night because all I want is to be loved by someone and to be able to hold someone in my arms. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad person. Why do I deserve to suffer what feels like an eternal mind prison.

I just can‚Äôt sit around and keep these thoughts in anymore. The singleness is eating me away. I know what a lot of people are going to say I have heard almost all of it. ‚ÄúNo one can fill the hole you are trying to fill but love for yourself‚Äù, ‚Äúlove yourself and they will eventually come‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople show up in your life when you least expect it‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt rush into a relationship because it won‚Äôt end well‚Äù among countless of other boilerplate statements that truly now only make me feel worse because you just told a person who has never had a relationship that is dying to be in one that even though they have spent a fifth of their life waiting to wait some more in the hopes that something happen when the record show it doesn‚Äôt.

I really can‚Äôt take the loneliness any longer and I know most of the people on here are lonely too but I need help getting out of this prison. Before I do something I can‚Äôt undo.

1951,ChunkiestMuffin,1591836080,3,"Hi guys and gals,

So, I feel as though I‚Äôm in a bit of a dilemma. I have had two serious relationships. My first relationship was when I was twenty two and, I dated my then girlfriend for four and a half years (2009 - 2013). My second serious relationship was over two and a half years (2015 - 2017) but, it was a long distance relationship.

After both of my relationships, I never once felt any sorrow, nor did I ever think of them again once I walked away. I spent a lot of time with these people; speaking to them every day, spending Christmas together and going on holidays as a happy couple, to literally never seeing them again and, I just didn‚Äôt care. As cold and callous as that may sound, I genuinely never thought of them again once the relationship was over. 

However, after breaking up with my ex girlfriend of four and a half years, back in 2013, I immediately dated a girl for approximately three months. The three months was like a whirlwind romance and I loved it! I got butterflies, always thought about her and once we split, it took me over five years to get over her. I literally thought about her every single day and everything reminded me of her - I truly loved her, wholeheartedly.

Just a curious thought.

Fuck, even when I'm not dating anyone but say I am talking to a girl and we're both into each other, just the socialness of talking to someone throughout the day, it brightens my mood up so much. Like to be honest it makes me more motivated, makes me more social in general like at work for example.

But what kills me, is I used to bounce in and out of relationships, before I got into my only really good and long relationship I had. And I'd bounce in and out of them because and they would just get tired of me. They wouldn't say that but they would never give me an exact reason and it was usually only within a month that this happened. 

But after my long relationship, it changed the way I've talked to women somehow? I used to be quite blunt, I wouldn't send unsolicited dick pictures. But I would send very flirtatious pictures. To be honest I was quite bold, I feel. But now I'm really modest and shy when it comes to talking and I have a hard time holding conversations over the internet but usually if I do meet up with someone it goes pretty well and even if it doesn't work out we usually become pretty good friends.

Unfortunately though I somehow can never really get to the hanging out part, and that's usually because I usually only click with people that are out of state or a couple hours away so it's quite hard to usually gets that point.

Maybe I was wrong, because I find myself more alone now than ever before and I feel like it‚Äôs swallowing me whole. I thought being alone was what I wanted. After all, it‚Äôs much more comfortable to be alone. I‚Äôve lived alone for years. I was an only child growing up. I learned to take care of myself before I even knew what it meant to take care of myself. I‚Äôve spent so much time alone, I thought that I knew what it meant to actually be alone.

But maybe I was wrong, because now that there‚Äôs no one to talk to, I am at the end of myself. I call my mother but she won‚Äôt answer the phone... it‚Äôs been weeks but she‚Äôs always too busy to talk. I message my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù but she lives with her boyfriend now and doesn‚Äôt have the time or patience to deal with me. I try to keep up with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù - people that I care for or get along with well enough to hold a conversation with.

I‚Äôve been trying, and maybe that‚Äôs the hardest part. I‚Äôve been trying harder than ever to fight off the loneliness but I am fucking drowning in it. There‚Äôs no one around, and I chose that. I chose to create the distance, to keep everyone at arm‚Äôs length. I chose to do things on my own, even though it often feels like there was never a choice. I wish I could say that it wasn‚Äôt my fault, though I‚Äôm not sure that would make anything better anyway. 

It‚Äôs just that I feel so lost. I feel like I‚Äôve dug myself a hole too deep to crawl out of this time. It seems like there‚Äôs no end, no light at the end of the tunnel. Every day is the same - wake up alone, work from home, check my phone over and over in hopes that maybe someone thought of me today, try to be interested in things I am clearly not invested in but need to keep myself from imploding, go to bed alone, repeat. The monotony is driving me crazy. The silence makes me want to crawl out of my skin. 

Maybe I was wrong about knowing what it‚Äôs like to be lonely, to be alone, because the loneliness is just the feeling of missing out. It feels pathetic and as much as I wish there were some hand to reach for, some open ear to hear all my droning on, some voice to keep me distracted or comfort me, I‚Äôm not sure I would even know what to do with it. 

And so I sit here, down in my hole, and all I‚Äôve got is time. Time to think, time to pace, time to feel, time to waste. I‚Äôm tired, and I don‚Äôt know where to go from here.

1979,maybeimreally,1591809857,8,"Hey.  I feel like I have some insight I can share.  After meeting many people online and irl, I've come to learn not to take things seriously when someone decides they want to talk to someone else.  Funny thing is I've learned it after quite a bit of time, after realizing that many of those that have downright ghosted me (or told me they no longer wanted to talk), it was because I wasn't meeting their expectations.  Whether that was having some nice conversations, or being placed in a frame that I wouldn't fit in.  It's just a matter of expecting something and not getting it.  And that's ok, I have met some people that didn't really meet my expectations, and I've told them I no longer wanted to keep in contact.  I never ghosted anyone though, but that's for another post.



So what's the secret I discovered that eventually made sense?  

The secret is to find a goal and to focus on it.  What do I want to do?  

Personally, I want peace of mind.  It's the best thing in the world.  I'd like be able to go somewhere nice and live there. 

It's not that difficult.  It teaches you the value of yourself.  Aiming at what you want and shooting for it is the thing you want to do to be able to ground yourself in a good reality that'll teach you the value of time, of effort, of things, of life.  Ever spend so much time alone wondering why nobody wanted to talk to you?  

Believe it or not, plenty of those people actually wondered the same about you. Why wouldn't YOU text them.  

Anyways, it's all about surrounding yourself with what you want to do, all of that good energy draws out good energy.  It's a feedback loop, it feeds itself.

Out goes the positive, positive energy replaces it within you.

Negative?  It draws in the negative.  

If you have no major goals, pick small ones.
Celebrate the littlest of victories, be kind to yourself and actually appreciate yourself managing to do something.  Care about YOU the way you'd care about a little lost kitten or puppy you've found.  Because believe me, if you do, you'll find that you're not in want of attention as much as you used to.  At least I don't anymore.

I try to meet ppl who dont do drugs and its just and awkward mess.

I daydream of a relationship where they don‚Äôt kill you from the inside out. To put it bluntly - I am not good enough to be treated good by my partners.

I believe that the biggest part of making friends and getting girls is first to love yourself. 
Very cliche? Yes. But loving yourself shows that you have the capacity to love. Who would want to date, or be friends with someone who doesn‚Äôt have enough love to give themselves, much less their friends? 

Part of loving yourself is recognizing and praising your strengths. Got good grades? Be proud of that. Diamond rank in league? Hell yeah be proud of that too. Don‚Äôt downplay any task that you achieved. You did that shit now be proud. Remind yourself that you accomplished something. And if you didn‚Äôt actually do anything, set goals and set out to achieve them. 

All that being said, you are not perfect. Part of it is recognizing your weaknesses and finding ways to address them. There is always something you can do better, whether it be exercising, dieting, skin care, grooming, fashion. These things may sound shallow, but they build your confidence, and confidence will help you to love yourself. 

With practice and time, hopefully you all can learn to love yourselves. People will see that and be attracted to it. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",lonely,"Hey guys. I want to suggest something that helped me out, with the hopes that it may help you guys out too.",2020-06-10 20:16:20

So, for context, I've felt like I've never really had a stable friend or friend group since I was little. People would frequently move, so I'd make new friends. Aaaannndd...they'd usually move away too. 

I don't want to self-diagnose, but this instilled a sort of abandonment issue within me. I became horribly clingy and paranoid for a small section of my life, treating my friends badly. I'd like to think I've grown quite a lot since then, but there's still room for improvement in terms of my own self-esteem.

I have recently had a very funny and close friend of mine move away. We spent a lot of time together (we had multiple classes together) and that hit me harder than anything, this happening before we were sent home due to the pandemic.
I'm honestly very glad they had us sent home not long after that took place, because I found myself becoming very deeply lonely and saddened before the day had really even started. (We had the first class together, and their energy would really help in the rough mornings)

Self-isolation has given me time to reflect on how I feel about and handle things. It's also given me time to think about what next year might look like. I'm very anxious about it, considering I don't have a very extensive group of friends, let alone ones that I've really scratched the surface on.
Most of my close-ish friends are either on different classes (and are guaranteed to be so next year), are upperclassmen, or just plain don't go to the same school.

Another thing, sometimes I feel like the friends I am still able to contact don't listen. I really don't know what to do, I'd like to talk about how I feel, but it's nearly impossible if it always feels like they don't even listen to the admittedly mundane things I have to say. I always try to listen to them, and it really sucks to be met with nothing. 
(Most of the time, they text, barely listening to my attempts at any conversation, and then the next day, I find out they managed to hook up with a guy...this has happened more than once just this year)

I get sick with worry just thinking about this. Sorry if this sounds weird or cringy, any advice would be great and help me so much!! (Also, I wrote this pretty late, couldn't sleep, so I apologize for any weird grammar/spelling)

TLDR: I'm super anxious about having little to no friends in my next year of school. The lack of really close friends I've had throughout my life has had a toll on my mental health, any advice??",lonely,"Friend Advice??? I uh, offer a squid for your information „Åè„Ç≥:ÂΩ°",2020-06-10 16:47:27

I have one friend thousands of miles away from me, but it already seems to be that we are not that close anymore. She is involved with her life and her boyfriend, which I support and still care about her, it feels like I've been abandoned. 
I made no new friends at my university, I missed my chance at making any by the Covid-19 outbreak, and have found myself alone and depressed.

I feel like I'm not interesting enough for anyone, and my awkward persona just doesn't fit anyone's taste. Otherwise I simply just cannot stand toxic behavior and I just leave the friendship. I'm alone, I stick out for the way I dress, and all I do is draw pictures, but that doesn't really bring me much joy anymore. I'm nearly 19 years old, I should have so much more experiences and friends, but I don't.

 I just want to care about someone or something again, and I wish someone may care for me as well. The days go by and I forget what day it is or what I did the day before. My anxiety keeps me awake at night, and my depression drags me through the day.

I just feel alone and unappreciated. Like a dog abandoned in the woods, waiting for their owners to come back. I feel like I've been exiled to an island with no people but the prison guard by my door. I have no purpose, no end goal. No substance.
I just wish I was a better person so people would like me, but I have no idea how to change when I'm all by myself in my room, in a rural home far from the nearest town.

I'm in the Marine corps, have been for over a decade. My Marine killed himself in early March.  I loved him as a brother. I was so mad at him initially. Deep down I still am. Flash forward to mid March COVID is causing everything to break.  I canceled my leave so I can continue to care for my Marine, inventory his room, get his uniform ready.  My wife was extremely understanding.  She and my son decided to go back to japan before things got worse.  We were supposed to to on leave together to see her sister get married ( my wife is Japanese, obviously my son is too) but with my brothers death and COVID,  I stayed at home and they left. 

Flash forward to late March, finally I can take my Marine back to his home, his family, the family I failed. Hes boxed up, we go to the airport, the personnel put on a bit of a show to show their respect and support.  It was nice.  I'm dressed in my alphas, fairly certain I met a stolen valor guy, didn't matter to me much though, just interesting. I arrive in CA, deplane my brother, salute as he's off loaded and brought to his family. They are crying, grasping at his casket. I stifle my emotion.  We drop him off at the funeral  home.  I told the director "" dont have an open casket, he was gone too long before we got him."" he said ""okay""  I pass out some items to the family. They continued to cry and I continued to stifle my emotion. 

Next day is the viewing.  I arrive in my blues. the Casket is open. Shocked I walk up to see my brother, to close the lid to do something to save the family  the horror.  He looks good. skin tone is correct, hair is parted the opposite way that he normally did it but he looked good. His hands looked good, not like frozen claws.  he looked sharp in the uniform too. I was glad I spent so much time on it.  He deserved to look good.  My emotion surges like  acid reflux and swallow hard to keep it down. his father shakes my hand and hugs me. 

next day is the funeral. I present the flag to his mother. I shovel dirt into his grave I leave the state and go back home, to an empty house.  

I have my dog, her name is Lucy, my co worker watched her while I was gone. 

New work schedule rules are implemented.  I dont abide by them. I'm supposed to work 2 days a week, I go in every day to stay busy. 

The travel band hits  

Online schooling starts.

My wife and son are still in Japan.

Every 2 weeks the Japanese airlines reevaluate, and extend there stopping of air travel. 

April is a mix of sleeping on the sofa and drinking on the week days. 

A lot of hiking, and running at 2 in the morn because I got into a horrible sleep schedule. go to work at 8 come back at 5, sleep until 2 am, run with the dog, stay awake and go to work.

For the month of April I thought it was kinda cool.  I'm a night owl, always have been.  But it isn't. 

Covid is in full swing. 

I have friends, maybe 5 true friends, and that's fine with me. I see one on a regular basis, but he has a family. I dont want to bother him and take him away from being a father and husband.

Have an acquaintance over a few times to drink and chit chat.  Its nice but we aren't really friends, just 2 guys.

I talk to my wife and son maybe every other day via video call. its always short.  

I tell them I love them and miss them and sometimes they just hang up. My heart hurts. 

I start  to get drunk and sleep in my sons bed.  I would try so hard to think of there faces. hugging them, imagining them, reaching through the void with my mind just so I can be close to them.  I wake up sad.

I see my dead Marines' face from time to time in the corner of my eye.  I tell him I'd wish he'd stay longer. he never does. 

Its the beginning of May, I've realized I spent a lot of money on booze, cut back a bit. it works. I stop using chewing tobacco, I quit, it works. I get enrolled in to college again. Paperwork clears. 

Auto pilot is on. 

I stop seeing my Marine in the corner of my eye, and I miss it. 

Flash to late may, I turn 30. My wife and son still in Japan. They send me a video wishing me happy birthday. I cry. I miss them so much.

Its early June now,  They will be in Japan until august or so it seems.  

My wife doesn't call me much, I seem to be the one initiating the convo every time.  I love her and miss her so much. My son has grown so much. so tall now, his Japanese speech is very good now. to the point he is forgetting English.  I dont mind though. Work is Good, i get to talk to people but I catch myself slipping and voice my sadness and, hell, depression abut my wife and son being gone.

Its different this time, my last deployment was to Syria, and it was  ""fun"". A good learning experience.  the threat of death was real, made me chairish my wife and son more.  I would dream of us laying in bed together and we would all die together. I knew it was because I was afraid of not having the experience of them again.  If we died in that moment, we would die perfect, together.  But that was the extent of it.  I wasn't lonely there, maybe because I had other things to worry about, like not getting arty'd to death. 

I find myself dreaming those things again.

I just feel so lonely with out them in my life. physically her with me. I cant care for them or cook for them. clean up after them, teach my son, love my wife. it feels so unreal, as if just remembering the past and they are gone. 

Some days are harder then others. 

 some days when I come back from work, sometimes I just mix a drink and feel myself sink down into the void, and if  I try just hard enough I can hold my sons or wife's hand.

Deep down I just want to die.  I just miss them so fucking much,  I want to hold my son, I want to hold my wife but I feel like I never will again.  

My friend who I see regularly, Ive cooked for him and his family a few times.  Roasted chickens or pork tenderloin, its a good time, but every time, as soon as they leave and I close the door, the game is over and the emptiness hits. 

The doggy is here. she helps a little but we dont talk much. 

I still feel myself slipping. Wanting to see my dead Marine's face again, thinking that my family is gone. IDK, there is so much more, so much that i cant handle.  I just want my Son and Wife back.  even deeper down, I just want to talk to someone again .",lonely,I feel myself slipping sometimes.,2020-06-10 13:21:02

2023,GeneralWalters421,1591755964,6,"So I‚Äôve been seeing a counselor for these last few months now. I‚Äôve been quite depressed and lonely for a while but never consistently saw counseling until now. I‚Äôve had a reasonably screwed up life, as in my parents do care for me for the most part and never physically abused me but they did divorce when I was young, forcing me to move across the world multiple times with a split family, while also doing pretty screwed up things like forcing me to take sides and my Dad forcing me to not show affection to my Mum so I could guilt her. I also am kind of autistic and generally introverted, which all things considered has meant I've been pretty lonely for most of my life, never being in a relationship, having no friends and family being emotionally distant.

I'm now 18 and just going into my second year of uni. (Currently in isolation with my Mum in New Zealand during the holidays, but will leave back to Canada for school in early September). While I've been here I've been talking to a counselor through video calls. It has helped somewhat and I don't feel as totally miserable as I was when I left school, but at the same time I've always kinda had up and down cycles.

One of the big things I have been upset about that brought me into a ""down"" was this relationship with this girl I meet in a class who became my first real friend in a long time. I'll avoid ranting but I basically fell in ""love"" with her (I know it's a strong word but it was so much stronger than any crush I've had in the past), she obviously didn't feel the same way, but that time of not knowing, brought me more hope, happiness and meaning than I have ever felt in my life. When things didn't work out I feel into a deep depression once again, but decided to see a counselor to talk about life in general so here I am.

I was talking to her today, about having a lack of meaning in my life, and just general apathy. I thought before it was possibly because of clinical depression so i talked to a doctor a few days before this based on the counselors recommendation. The doctor basically explained that he was unsure if I was depressed per-say, but that I was certainly going through a lot. He wasn't willing to take medication of the table, but he recommended other options like continued counseling and general advice like routine exercise before he tried anything, I kinda agreed with him.

Anyway, back to today. Despite my lack of a diagnosis, I still felt something missing so I tried to explain this to my counselor, and my theory was basically that I felt I was still struggling on the love and belonging stage of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which is why I struggled with finding motivation for other long-term goals like career and finding motivation. On explaining this to her she kinda agreed but basically told me that you have to learn to be okay with being alone. (I mean she suggests finding friends, but that's really not the same and I've honestly never had much interest, because I don't feel much happiness from just casually hanging out, and find it more trouble than it's worth). I understand where she was coming from in terms of relationships however, you can't really rely on others for happiness, but at the same time, I feel so alone, and life has just felt mediocre for so long. I don't want to accept that... Yeah I know I can't find a relationship overnight, but I have hobbies, interest and a reasonable amount of self-esteem, so I can't keep learning to accept this boring and meaningless life.

But of course it is hard, dating is hard, and it does not help that I still have strong feelings for this girl. I've tried online dating while I'm stuck in New Zealand, but it's such an awful experience, and frankly I don't want to just date for the sake of it, I want reciprocated love, I want to feel like I did when with this other girl again. I want to feel that happiness, that hope and motivation to better myself. It just sucks knowing that I won't find that if not never, not for a long time at least.

So yeah, I'm not sure what to think. I hope I am lonely and missing something in my life, because at least then I have something to work towards and look forwards to. The whole point of this incoherent rant is that I don't want to be okay with being alone. I don't want this to be the best life can offer. I will have to wait of course, but I want their to be something worth waiting for...

But it's still the same result. 

I've gone on dates with men on dating apps, from work, bars, different career backgrounds and cultures/ethnicity/race and it's the same thing. They just want to HOOKUP, and when I say I'm not ready they disappear or I have to block them because for them ""no"" means try harder.

It probably sounds selfish and sadistic but I kinda liked reading your stories here because it made me feel less lonely in my loneliness. I've never felt normal and I know I'm not but at least I'm not the only one experiencing this kind of things.

First of all my situation isn't as bad as others. That's a part of the problem. I feel pretty pathetic making so many manners for these tiny problems while I have a healthy life with no problem about money or health. I even have a few friends. I have not a lot of contact with them as most of them will only reply when I message them first. I have a good friend that I consider as my best friend but of course if he had to choose his favorite friends I'd be far from the top of the list, so it's only one way.

I've always felt empty and lonely. It's not a violent sensation where you just cry for a night and then you're okay. It's a feeling that has always been there, a feeling that's perfectly normal for me. I'm used to it. It doesn't even really hurt, I very rarely feel emotions. I have trouble expressing it but I could explain it like this : everyone has a flame inside. Something that makes them live. Something that makes them go forward and want to see the next day of their life. Well I lack this flame. I live because it's better than dying. I expect the next day because I can't do otherwise. I've never thought about suicide or self harming, I've never felt pain or sadness. I don't feel anything. Recently I tried to remember the last time I felt happiness. I can't remember. I sometimes feel pleasure when I eat or when someone sends me a message, but it's only for a second. I can't remember a time I've felt happy.

I suck at talking. I never know how to break the glass and then often I don't know how to carry on the discussion.

I can't really make friends. I already have some but I can't make any new ones so I lose them one by one without getting others, meaning I'll soon be all alone.

I've already tried to branch out via Discords, topics like GamersPals or things like that but it never really worked. The discussion quickly ends.

I don't really have passions, only activities I do to have something to do rather than looking at a wall all day. I'm not someone interesting so I can't really find people with a common passion. Also I don't like parties so I don't really meet new people.

I've never been in love (and no one loved me), never had a girlfriend and know I won't ever have one. I've accepted it now even though I'd love to have one. Not really for family or sex, but just to have someone for me, someone who cares about me, someone with which I could have a connection. Someone to do common things with. Someone who would tell me how their day was. Someone to share my life with.

And I'm getting scared about my future. Until now I've met new people every year because of school. And eventually I made new relationships. It's not like friends but I won't spit on someone to talk with even if it's for talking twice a year. But soon I'll quit school to start working. And I won't meet anyone anymore. I'm scared because my actual situation is the best I'll ever have and it will only get worse.

To brighten the whole I have a bad case of low self esteem caused by my father.

I feel like I'm a lesser human. It's not a specific thing. Sometimes I see someone stupid and feel smarter. But still I feel like as a whole I'm inferior to them.

And I am bad at basically anything. Even in the domains of my ""hobbies"" I'm always bad : I suck at every genre of videogames, I have not any talent at playing music, a very weak music culture...

Lately everything I attempt fails when it works perfectly for the others. It's like I'm in another world.

All of these could be summed up as : no one cares or will ever care about me because I'm not interesting in any way. And I kinda hate me for feeling this way while life gave me everything a human needs.

And my actual life that I despise is the best one I'll ever have until I die. I'm at the beginning of my sinking.

I guess I miss physical affection too. The last time I got to touch anyone like a hug or something must be like 10 years ago with my mother.

Congrats, you read the whole story ! I hope you liked reading this and that it helped you feeling a little less alone in your loneliness.

I have been alone far to long.

When I was in my 20's I fell in love for the second and last time.
We were together for 14 years.

YES, I made my share of mistakes and often took for granted that she would always be there for me (us).

Until one morning as we were getting ready for work she told me that she was leaving me and moving out. 
This devastated my soul.

And while I have dated since then, I just haven't found anyone to spend my life with.
Someone to share the good along with the hardships that are just a normal part of life.
 
I am college educated and hold degrees in engineering along with long time studies in psychology.
 
As the weather turns warm, I watch people as they go about their day, hand in hand.
Maybe I shouldn't admit this but it brings a tear to my eyes.

My heart long's for companionship.
Someone who loves to discover life.
Someone who enjoys debating life, love and the nature of the universe.

I go on hikes, adventures, movies by myself all the time. I‚Äôve never felt lonely even though I was alone. I often go to restaurants and ate alone. But I am having some trouble recently. 

Currently, I have no friends as they‚Äôve all moved away. My roommate and I don‚Äôt get along, we literally avoid each other in our apartment. Due to this pandemic, my work is on hold, so I have nothing to do except sit at home with lonely thoughts. My family and I are not physically together, and we don‚Äôt get along either. 

I literally have nobody in my life and this pandemic is just making it worst. I‚Äôve always told everyone I didn‚Äôt need a partner in my life because I‚Äôm comfortable with myself. But now, I really want a person in my life. Someone I can care about, and do stuff with. I am so lonely it is insane. I‚Äôm contemplating if I should contact my ex and cause drama because I am so bored (80% joking).

None of my friends can relate to this because they are all in loving relationships either with their SO or families. Sometimes I call 6 of my friends on my phone just so I can talk to someone, most of them don‚Äôt pick up because they actually have work and have a life.

I spend two hours walking/running everyday. I go on hikes and travel in state once-twice a week. I can‚Äôt go more often because it takes up too much time. 

I‚Äôm running out of options to keep myself from feeling lonely. I tried making friends online, but it‚Äôs weird with the pandemic happening. I just want things to go back to the way it was last summer, when I was busy with work and had friends!

2096,Gardenweedz,1591694925,2,"I‚Äôve had a very rough year, I was in a very toxic relationship. I broke up with her 5 times because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, but it‚Äôs like she had a hold on me that I couldn‚Äôt break free from. So each time we broke up she always talked me back into it and everytime it happend I‚Äôd be sitting in my car about to drive home and feel nothing but regret and sadness. So many times of feeling like I was so close yet so far. Until the beginning of May. I finally did it and it was rough. I trusted some friends with some parts of our relationship that I didn‚Äôt know how to handle in hope of getting some advice that could help, considering they had been together for years and years while I‚Äôm just some 19 year old that had no idea what he was doing. After we broke up the two friends I trusted told her everything I trusted them with because they felt I was a horrible person for talking about my relationship with them instead of her. The reason I never really brought anything to her in the past is I was intimidated by her. She got angry at me a lot for stupid reasons and God she really knew how to make me feel stupid, uneducated, and honestly like I knew nothing about anything whenever the truth is I‚Äôve been on this earth for almost 21 years, so maybe I don‚Äôt know as much as her, but I still knew a thing or two. She was 10 years older than me, had lots of life experience and a career while I‚Äôm just trying to get through my last two years of college. It was honestly the toughest year of my life and I‚Äôm finally free of it. Since then I feel like my own person again and like I‚Äôve found my identity. Only problem is, I feel so alone, so depressed. I understand May was a month ago, but that relationship made me so sad and frustrated that I just want to feel loved, heard, and like I‚Äôm aloud to be myself without feeling ashamed. I just want to feel love for someone and be excited to get a text from them instead of being anxious and nervous like I was in my previous relationship. The thing that really sucks is I‚Äôve been in love with someone else for months now. Honestly I think how I felt for her was the reason I was able to get out of the relationship in the end. This other girl treats me well, she‚Äôs gorgeous, accepts me for who I am, and is such a sweet person who I wish I could show off to the whole world. During times where I did things that were horrible and bad she still stood by me and told me she‚Äôll always be there for me no matter what, and she‚Äôs kept that promise as long as I‚Äôve known her. I‚Äôm not a cheater so I didn‚Äôt pursue her while I was in my other relationship, but now that I‚Äôm not I want to. Only to find out that she‚Äôs had a boyfriend for almost 3 years now, that‚Äôs longer than I‚Äôve even known her. I‚Äôve seen him, good looking guy who‚Äôs very intelligent, smart, and so nice he couldn‚Äôt hurt a fly. And he wants to work in the medical field as well. Out of all of these, the only thing I feel I can even compare to this guy is that I‚Äôm nice and decent looking, but my career path, intelligence, and smarts just don‚Äôt measure up to him in the slightest. Recently I told her how I felt, sort of, instead of telling her it was her I‚Äôm talking about, I said it was someone else I knew instead. I understand that telling her is probably wrong and I shouldn‚Äôt have done it, but it‚Äôs hard seeing her all the time and having to keep my feelings inside. All I ever want to do when I see her is kiss her, hold her, tell her I love her, ask her how her day was, and get lost in her beautiful eyes while she tells me all the intriguing details about her day. I‚Äôve never felt this way about anyone before, and it‚Äôs hard that I can‚Äôt do anything about it. Oddly enough when I told her how I felt about this ‚Äúother girl‚Äù (even though it‚Äôs her I‚Äôm talking about), I feel like she knew I was talking about her. She urged me to be patient and that I don‚Äôt know what the future holds. So here I am, waiting patiently. But this past month has felt like a whole year. I‚Äôm lonely, sad everytime I wake up, and I feel all around depressed. I thought hanging out with friends might help, but it hasn‚Äôt. I thought watching movies and trying to keep myself busy would help, but it hasn‚Äôt either.

I can comfortably say that I'm okay with how my life is, even if its gut wrenching

Last night a stranger told me to not focus on having a relationship. I told him that it's hard because for the past 4 years i had the luxury of seeing everyone so happy with someone else. Hell... even my mother got married at age 50. 

Anyway my friend said to accept my fate and then things will happen naturally, which I sort of agree with. If I accept my loneliness and no one wanting to be with me, how would that attract anyone/ wouldn't I choose not to be in a relationship since I'll be okay with never being with someone? Idk that just doesn't make sense to me. It's also irritating when people say ""be patient""... well I didnt know 1200+ DAYS of absolutely no kisses, hugs, sex, regular chatting, or even a good morning or good night texts was being in a hurry.

Sometimes I really do just want to die and be out of the way. I dont complain like this in real life, but I had to because no matter what I say or do nothing ever changes and its fucking irritating

The closest I've been to a relationship  is when I ""dated"" this girl my freshman year. But it was a bullshit relationship that didn't really mean anything. We were just two kids who liked each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Always at like 2 or 3am I get a wave of sadness almost everyday. I usually listen to music and just stare at my ceiling or I'll just go on instagram and wait for it to pass. Some nights it's worse than others. Some nights I cry a little and some nights I cry a lot. Since I don't have a girl to cuddle with sometimes I cuddle with a pillow and pretend its a girl, but it doesn't really help. I'm lonely in the sense that I don't have a girlfriend or anyone to love. I have good friends and family who I all love and they all love me. But it's different with a girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanna be loved. I just wanna cuddle, hold hands, go on dates and shit. But I have no one to do that with. And being in quarantine isn't helping. There's this really cute girl I share a mutual friend with. She goes to a different school than me but it turns out we live on the same street. I've only talked to her a little bit in DM's. I was thinking about asking her to walk on the bike path that we live right next to as a date I guess. But she doesn't really know who I am since like it said, we go to different schools, so she'll probably say no. If she does say no, there's another girl I'm interested in but she also goes to a different school than me and doesn't know who I am. I've talked to this other girl a little bit too. About Wawa coffee, and an Ice Cream place that I live by. So we've talked before, but it was just for like a day or 2 in Instagram DM's. These are both really cute girls who I would love to date, but I'm sure they probably don't look at me the same way I look at them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would text them, but since they're both really cute I'm sure they get hit up all the time from boys who just think they're sexy and just wanna hit. And I don't want them to think I'm just some random ass boy who wants sex. Yea sex is cool and all, but what I want is a wholesome loving relationship. I wanna go on walks and talk. I wanna hold hands. I wanna go on a date while we eat ice cream. Shit like that. Sex is just an extra thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night while I was falling asleep, I was daydreaming/fantasizing about going out to breakfast with either of these girls. Since it's a fantasy, we both start to like each other and eventually start a relationship. Which is all I want. I just want a wholesome loving relationship with a cute ass girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading this far. I'm planning on asking the girl who lives on my street out on a date. Hopefully she says yes. If anyone has any advice, please let me know.

2116,sherman4478,1591683577,16,"I have been apart of the same friend group since the summer after junior year and was basically in love with one of my closest friends at the time. I thought we connected in almost every way and would be great together but never asked her out because shit self esteem. We grew close for years and I finnally started to be more comfortable in my own skin so I started to be a bit more flirty with her and she seemed into it.

It went on like this for about a couple months and I finally asked her out on a date only for her to be completely uninterested the entire time and even making an excuse to leave early and I had no idea what went wrong I didnt magically change in the 24hours since I had asked her out. I tried to avoid her for a while but I saw her all the time because of the friend group so I didnt really get over it.

A while later I invited some of my friends including her over just to hang out and watch a movie or some thing. It had been a few weeks and neither of us had mentioned it so I figured she wanted to just stay friends which I was ok with. The group was supposed to consist of me, the girl I liked, and a couple from the friend group. The guy in the couple asked me a few hours before people were supposed to show up if he could invite his friend who was in town. I was reluctant but said yes, which I immediately regretted.

Within an hour of him getting there he was  making  out with the girl I was pretty much still in love with and been trying to make anything happen for months. The other two who knew how I felt saw nothing wrong with it and just did there own shit the entire night. So I was 5th wheeling in my own house and anytime I'd try to leave the room to not see this random guy sucking on her face people would start yelling at me to comeback after a few minutes of being alone. 

It was already one of the most miserable nights of my life. To make things even worse I had to drive her home and she saw nothing wrong with what happened and spent the entire drive talking about the random new guy who she apperantly could see herself dating now. I said maybe two things the entire drive because I didnt have anything I could even think to say. I have never felt so hollow as I did driving home that night.

2134,AMan_With_No_Plan,1591668427,6,"I know, this is probably just a another stereotypical lonely person on your feed. But I really need help to understand my life. As a preface, I want to just say that my comments on the surface seem very shallow, but there's a bit more to it, so I need someone to help me out and give me advice.

When I arrived at high school in ninth grade, I was very uptight. I gained several friends, but again I was pretty weird and uptight (probably due to the fact that I came from a very small private school the year before and didn't have many people to socialize with). As a kid with Indian parents and not much outside influence, I was pretty academically oriented, and I was kind of cocky about it in 9th grade. I didn't realize this until next year, when I realized that not many people were talking to me; some people I knew began calling me out for all my faults and being extremely ""cocky"". Although the things that people were calling me out for were a bit harsh, I definitely saw a problem with myself that I sought out to change; and I did. But after toning down myself to how I wanted myself to be, I became a much less talkative person with very little confidence in both my personality and my looks. Consciously, I really never was bothered by them, but for some reason it still took a toll.

Back when junior year began, my social life was definitely doing much better than before, but I was never really assimilated with any group and no one really wanted to get that close with me. Just as things were getting better, the Coronavirus pandemic struck, and I was simply unable to get closer and see those that I wanted to see more. But while with the Coronavirus pandemic came the inability to see other people, it also gave me a lot of time alone. As time has passed, I have slowly lost a lot of confidence in myself, both in my looks and in my personality. I think I'm pretty ugly and have always thought that (always one point for myself that I've not had going for me) and have started again to think that my personality was flawed in many ways. When I was invited a few times to meet with other people recently, I find myself wondering why I'm there and why people want me there. Since then, people haven't really been talking to me. I have pretty much lost the voice that I once regained and it's pretty painful; I simply can't find myself anymore and am slowly losing my identity.

How can I fix this? Am I allowed to be confident in myself? I don't want to be giving myself a false illusion of myself simply to be shot down again by people. I feel like the world is simply rapidly moving on, just without me. People are enjoying their life, and I want to as well. Yes, I can tell myself ""Wait till college, it's a completely different environment"". But, I don't think is completely valid. A loss in confidence and self-identity definitely carries over wherever you go in life and makes it super hard to get friends, let alone a girlfriend (on a separate note, I've had a crush on only two people in my life. The first one was in middle school, so it doesn't really count (although it was somewhat successful. The second one I thought I could trust and gave me a bunch of signs but just left me on read when I confessed to her (I guess maybe I misinterpreted? I'm not quite sure, there were a lot of signs in my opinion at least) and now spreads random shit behind my back. I haven't had a crush since then because I feel like it's just impossible for me to get anything out of it besides sorrow, which also has to do with my shit confidence and how I think I'm super ugly, which I am. Also, now I pretty much can't talk to any girls without being weird; it's like there are two personalities inside my brain that have developed because I always scold myself for being weird).

In any case, I want someone to give me some advice. One good part is that throughout high school, I've pretty much had one constant friend who hasn't shit-talked me and has stuck up for me behind my back (as I did for him as well), which has kind of been the factor that has been curing my loneliness; but even he is kind of moving past me and is changing. I can't really ask him this kind of stuff either because he's shit at giving advice and I feel like even we're getting a bit distant. Someone please help :(",lonely,Please give me advice...,2020-06-09 12:07:07

2174,Another_Whisper_,1591632869,3,"So, i am a 26 gay man. And i feel left out in this society, left out alone in life.

In my career i am succesfull. I worked my way up and i am having my finals in University in a few weeks. I am living alone, out of my hometown and have a bunch of loyal friends. But you know... friends are friends and not partners or parents. 

I lost the relationship to my father when i was 16 and came out. It never healed, sure we now talk 2 times a weeks through a phone call. But the emotional distance is still way too big. I lost the relationship to my mother in the last years due to her not seeing my emotional problems and only comming for my help and assistance. My parents werent there for me in the last 10 years, so i became an adult over night, grew up all by myself and had to figure out my way in live. Sure it sounds heroic that i did it, and indeed it is impressive to others, yet no one seems to notice the reason things went that way. While others always had this sipportive background in their familys, i was standing alone.   


And to make things worse i am single for years by now. Most of my friends are getting married or engaged or a pregnant. I am invited to their weddings, always planned in with another possible guy. But it is sad to be the best man of the bride, while all the bridesmaids and other men are taken or engaged. So i will atend these Weddings and Partys all by myself again and will leave all by myself again.   


While others have someone to lean on, i lie awake at night, crying myself into sleep or worrying about the fears and problems i have. No one hugs me and tells me, that i am safe in their arms. No one looks at me and tells me that i am beautiful and handsome. No one tells me, that they love me romantically and that they dream about a future with me.   


Sometimes i feel like my life is a bad joke, cause people often say ""You are so good in your job, i wish i could do that"". Sure i am good, i know that.

It's my own fault I am lonely. I've ghosted the few real friends I had. Ignored every single message checking up on me. I igonored my father calling me a few minutes ago when I was about to end it. 

It is my own fault that I don't let anyone get close, because then they'd find out that I am just pretending to be okay. That I am about to die in the next few years. That my body is shutting down if I don't turn it off before. 

About a month ago I found a discord server I really like that kept me going somehow, but it is getting less active. 

The last time I touched another human was in September. Didn't even shake a hand since then.

I don't know what to do. I don't have a future. I feel lonely even if I am with my floormates or VC with the few not so close friends I didn't ghost till now. I hate beeing lonely, but I want to stay alone. I don't like the pressure of close connections, i guess.

I go around and find every random person on the internet having 10s of relationships. already. And here I am who has never even talked to any girl informally. I can't help it that I went to an all boys school and focused only on studying hard. (Which I think was a very wrong decision). I study in an engineering college right now again with almost no girls (1 girl :25 boys ). And it is situated in a very small town where no social events happen. I don't even look any handsome and my confidence is down of course cuz confidence needs experience. But to get experience I need confidence. So I'm in the downward spiral.  


So, I guess, after I work my ass off in my phd and get into a big job, at like 27-28, I'll suddenly become a child bearing material, and women after getting bored of relationship, will finally want me to raise their children. And of course, since I'm so desperate, I'll always be in an inferior position in a relationship, I'll never be LOVED, I'll only be used as a child bearer because I can earn money for them. No proposals, no secret letters,  or those romantic stuff, for me. I guess I've already missed the bus for any innocent relationship. All girls of my age already have 10 relationships. So yeah, no way I'm getting any genuine love at all.

2190,TurboDyke,1591615256,20,"As the title says I'm not sure where I even start.  

I am a 33 year old  single male, that alone is tough.  

I guess I've been finding the past few days a bit rough.  

I've been alone for almost 2 years now. When I say alone I mean really alone.  

I see the people I work with everyday but the connection I have with them is different from how they see each other.  

People always say they like me and I am a good person but it's really not the case. Just an example on smoke breaks I seem them with each other and they ask if they wanna go out for a smoke. No one has ever asked me that.  

Its slowly starting to sink in that I'm just not the type of person that other people want to spend time with.  

I've been trying to figure out why but I just cant put my finger on what's wrong with my personality.  

It's difficult man. Really difficult. I'm 33 now 34 soon and the realisation that this is probably as good as things are going to get for me has hit. I'm not going to have a family of my own or any of those things one day. It's really hard having that constant hole in my chest.  

The biggest killer of males my age in my country is not drugs or alcohol, its suicide. I can understand why. I'm not sure what it is about our society that no one really cares about middle aged men. Many of us are literally left to fend for ourselves.  

I'm working in a minimum wage job which I'm desperately trying to change. I tried to go back to university this year but my application for funding has been rejected. I struggle to pay my Bill's from month to month and my house is falling apart, I cant afford to fix a lot of the things and being able to afford the fees to go back to university is simply not an option.  

I'm really beginning to look at what is ahead of me and question how much further I want to go.  

I would give anything for things to be different and I'm trying to change them but everytime i just get knocked back down.  

I just really dont know what to do anymore.  

Sorry for ranting and the long post but I have no one who will listen and i guess I'm just really starting to struggle with things now. I'm so tired of coming back to this empty home everyday. I just dont know anymore.",lonely,I don't really know where to start,2020-06-08 21:20:56

I am just so tired of being rejected by all the guys that I ve liked. 

I really loved that boy in a different manner. I think that he is the first person that I really loved. I did not liked his look in a special way, but I loved the way he talked, his way of seeing things, his way of talking about me, his way of living life. He was the first guy that made me feel beautiful, intelligent and powerful. He was the first person that made me feel appreciated. He is one of the most intelligent people that I ve met, he knows how to have fun but also how to be responsible for his life. We used to talk a lot and to go to places together (even more ‚Äú personal things‚Äù happened between us :)) ) but we have never been into a relationship because I was ‚Äútoo little‚Äù, I cannot deny it, he is 23 and , but I ve always considered myself more mature.  He  always said to me that he does not need a relationship and that he just want to live life and have fun. 


I feel exhausted, this is not the first time when this happens. I am starting to feel that boys just want me for my body and for their sexual pleasure.  I am literally feeling just like a sexual object. 

I am not a perfect person but I am me you know, and it seems like nobody will ever try to love me and my way of being.  I feel like it s impossible for someone to love me. 

Maybe it s my fault to for not trying harder or showing him that I had such strong feelings for him, well who knows.

I went to my best friend at the time and was asking for advice but he was distant. Little did I know everything I was talking to him about he was telling her. Long story short I found out they were fucking around behind my back. It continued for awhile and me and her somehow tried again after a year and it all fell out again she was on drugs and fucking people for money and drugs.. I haven‚Äôt spoken to her or my ex best friend since 2017. And I believe my ex bestfriend did all this because before me and ash even got together again I was taking to his ex gf at the time because we both kinda had a thing for each other but we never capitalized on anything. Or at least I didn‚Äôt because I was afraid it would turn out like my last relationship and I was scarred. But I believe since I was taking to his ex who he still loved and was in denial about is the reason why he fucked up my relationship with ash. Ok now it‚Äôs 2019 I was in a relationship with this girl des, short girl, super cute, has a son whose super cute and suuuuuuper religions. But I finally thought I had got past everything I had dealt with.. but then came the anxiety attacks w/flashbacks of all the torment and false love and heartbreak. Me and des were fooling around and she asked me if I was ready to have sex and of course I said ya. But.. she didn‚Äôt want to use protection. And I told her I would feel better about it if we didn‚Äôt because I wasn‚Äôt ready to have my own children. At the time I had no job and wasn‚Äôt financially stable for that. But she wouldn‚Äôt let it go. Every time it came up she would say ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt used protection in years‚Äù. Like you don‚Äôt say? Well I haven‚Äôt been one to go to church a lot. I talk to the lord when I need him the most. But she tells me I‚Äôm not right with god. And we had a long talk about that. And everything was fine. I went to church with her things were pretty good. Late that night we start to fool around and it happened again, I started having this anxiety/panic attack shit happen and I stopped myself from doing anything. Because I truly was developing feelings for her but my mind kept telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôs all for nothing, the same shits going to happen again‚Äù then started the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre worthless, little dicked, virgin boy‚Äù thoughts and I just kept putting myself down over and over again. And eventually I told her she was right and that me and her had to split up. It‚Äôs now 2020, I have a decent job, I‚Äôm trying to get my life moving. But we have had talks of war, a virus outbreak and riots. And the whole world is fucking nuts right now. Lately I‚Äôve been trying to at least get myself out there and try to talk to people and maybe I can find my someone. And you know I‚Äôve been pretty good about joking about myself over the years like haha I‚Äôm a fat boy and haha virgin this, haven‚Äôt had sex that blah blah. But now.. even when I rip on myself it‚Äôs getting to me. Because I‚Äôm actually starting to believe that I‚Äôm going to be the real life 40yro virgin. And I made I joke about it to one of my friends and said if that‚Äôs the case on my 40th birthday you‚Äôll find me dead. And I was just kidding about it but.. then I started to think about it. I‚Äôve had thoughts of suicide before and I‚Äôve came close. But the thought of the devastation of my family and friends has stopped me. But things are getting very difficult to deal with. I put on a smile and tell people I‚Äôm ok but in reality I‚Äôm screaming inside until I‚Äôm fucking bleeding. Idk.. maybe this whole story is me seeking attention from strangers or maybe I just needed somewhere to vent my frustrations. I‚Äôve left somethings out because his story is long enough anyway. But that‚Äôs just minor details. Anyway, to anyone who gets this far, thank you for reading. I‚Äôll take comments good and bad at this point. Hope you all have a great night.

What I look for in girls is definitely trust, trust is huge to me but they also have to be a goofball and have to be easy going.  I don‚Äôt care what you look like as long as your proud of what you look and that you think you are cute and pretty.  Personality is key definitely they have to have a fun and layer back personality.

I‚Äôm not saying you have to talk to me but if you like what you heard chat with me I would really appreciate that so thank you if you do.

I‚Äôm one of the few single people left in my friend group, along with another guy and girl. Awhile back I started having a slight infatuation of some sort for the guy friend. He is almost like the prime model of what I would want in a boyfriend, extroverted, charismatic, funny, not bad looks, great personality and more. So I always go back and forth questioning if I really like him like that because he treats me kindly, or just the idea I created of him. Who knows I‚Äôm still trying to figure that out. 

Anyways, today another mutual of ours kind of confirmed that this guy may like the girl mentioned earlier. I always had my suspicions but I feel like about our convo everything I heard was right. 

At this current state, I feel weird, sorta glad, but also jealous...? I mean for the longest time I‚Äôve been trying to accept the fact that this guy is probably into that girl. Plus everyone in the group secretly ships them. That part I‚Äôm glad for because they each deserve happiness! 

Except it‚Äôs weird... I WANT to be fully happy for them instead of jealous, since they‚Äôre my friends, but my mind/heart feels conflicted... 

I guess overall, I keep wondering why is it that I‚Äôm the one sucked into these situations??? I‚Äôm the one people come to for relationship advice, when I haven‚Äôt even had a Bf yet, or told about these possible relationships of people I have weird feelings for. 

How do I get over these feelings??? Or am I jealous of the fact that I‚Äôll be the only single person left in the friend group. It feels like we‚Äôre always on a path together but I keep coming in last.

2228,lctuba89,1591586088,1," I'm 31 years old. If I look back on my life thus far, I'd say I've had a very peaceful but boring life. I grew up being bullied as a kid but it got better as time went on. After I graduated high school, I started gigging out in bars (I'm a bassist) and I felt more alive than I ever did growing up. Not too long after that, I landed a girlfriend who I'm still with till this day. We've been together for roughly 10 years and even though we've been together that long, she still doesn't know the real me. I'd say I've let her into about 60 percent to who I am. In fact, not one person I'm close to knows everything about me, because I feel like if I ever revealed my entire self, I would be socially crucified. Some people say I'm kind and considerate, some say I'm aloof, some probably even consider me a cold-hearted asshole. As a result of the choice of not revealing my true self, I feel extremely lonely. However, if I don't filter out who I am, I'll be even more lonely. Damned if I do, damned if I don't. This feeling of loneliness has put dark thoughts in my head several times and even got my being a borderline alcoholic at one point. I've stopped drinking regularly because of that, but I'm still lonely anyway.

Never said a word during class growing up, never got invited to anything, and my parents never paid attention to me or helped me through things. My parents were never people I could talk to about things, or share things with. I've had a lot of self-esteem and mental health problems come out of my issues with my parents and they still don't care. Even in high school, I got bullied pretty bad, and suffered really severe mental health problems but still was alone. I did a lot of bad things back then, never went to class (I nearly got expelled because of this) and almost didn't graduate. Somehow, the faculty at my school were more concerned with what a bad kid I was instead of the other issues in my life, so I wasn't anyone's favourite by any means. Even at all the jobs I've had, I flew under the radar and was invisible to my coworkers and bosses. I started drinking and smoking pretty heavily in high school and those issues continued into my first 2 years of college.  I've never had a best friend, just a lot of acquaintances. All my romantic relationships ended because I got cheated on, and my last ex was pretty horribly abusive to me. Currently trying to pursue someone else, but like the last 2 guys I've pursued, I got ghosted. Now, I'm 21, no friends, no kids, with no relationship with my parents, single, and not working due to corona virus. I feel like I'm always going to be a loner and that its the cause of all my mental health problems. I'm just really tired of being alone, but at the same time I don't know how I could adjust to not being alone. It would just be so different than the life I've lived.

I read I lot of post were people are moaning about getting ghosted and then they try again and make the same mistakes that got them ghosted previous. If all your doing is talking your not bonded your not a big enough part of there life that your no longer disposable. That's sad but that's the way it is. friends need to meet and they need to spend time with each other to form connection. I want to do all the emotional things for you, if you have a problem i'm here to listen and give advise but that can't be all it is. there are so many thinks i would love to do but i cant because i no friends, i will list them and if any of these sound good we could be friends. These are ideas and i'm happy to do the type of things that you like doing, if you enjoy it I will do it. I also guess that a lot of people here have anxiety issues or other mental issues and i will support you if your willing to try i just need to know your going to stick with me.¬†

2289,straightdude1567,1591547700,1,"Here is my story 
I was raised in a nuclear family both my parents where workaholics but they really cared about me and my elder sister . I was confined to the 4 walls of my house(still am) growing up i was very introverted , very nerdy boy who had only computer games as his company. I had 3 or 4 good friends at that time but now they are nowhere to be found. When i was 12 yrs old i fell in love with a girl in my class she was and is a very good person i wanted to tell her i loved her but i wasnt courageous and i didnt tell her.soon we moved to another town and got settled there.Still music and video games were my only company.i used to take part in social gatherings and i loved it till i moved from my hometown at age 13 from there my life took a turn for the worst. I dont like to talk much so in new town i didnt have any real friends just some kids who would play with me that's all fast forward 5 years we grew up and im in the peak of puberty. I became very awkward in talking to people. Even buying things from shop is difficult for me i screw up and start stuttering and messes everything up. 
I thougt everything will be all right when i join a college . I was dead wrong üòê. In college i had my own opinions that made me a hated person (one of the top 10 in my class) i was pushed aside and was neglected whatever i said didnt matter it was like i wasnt existing there. the so called alpha males rule here. This made me depressed and highly anxious which lead to me fucking up more things. I found some friends whom i blindly trusted but later i found out that they were pity friends and negative for me.so im trying to leave them even though ill be alone its better this way.i had a crush on this girl in my class i gained all the courage in the world and asked her out. No surprise she rejected me (later i got to know she was in love with a senior douchebag for 2 yrs ) now i cant look at her face since i made my self vulnerable by saying sorry 10 or 1000 times. She and her friends now say that im a creep/awkward nerd. 
This was too much for me i was on medication for anxiety and it worsened i had suicidal idealations and im depressed. My parents know all these but they are helpless. I visited psycholohist but still i find it useless.
Now i walk alone , play games , browse yt reddit etc 
Deep inside i know im gonna duffer a lot in the future since i have no social contact. All my classmates have social interactions and it helps them reach their goal they are very happy.
Look at me i am fat playing videogames at my moms house fapping the nights off on porn 
Absolutely useless worthless suicidal garbage
I only live for my family and my one and only true friend.

I haven't talked to anyone since tuesday and just spent the days playing games I don't enjoy, eating only when I really need to and waiting for each day to finally be over.

Not allowed to go out to get fresh air so dumb

Mum scolds me for bringing in bad jinns for being sad at home.

You know why I don't open up to you guys anymore?

You ask about it, and then you dont listen to what I have to say
You think the whole fucking world revolves around you and you clearly made it happen so its 6our fucling fault like no I'm sad and I dont know why, it doesnt mean it's your fucking fault and you dont have to scold me for making it appear that way.

Yeah we get it you're always too busy with work when we were younger, even now. Yeah, youre always so busy dad, I see no point talking it out.

You dont want to talk about feelings without pulling in religion and how I should be more faithful.
And whenever I tell you to stop it, you guys just say that I dont know how to talk.

Yeah maybe you can explain why I dont know how to talk. Maybe because I couldnt look up to my parents as parents, just as people who always say, in the real world you have to do this this this how will you deal with all that
Maybe because I've never came about properly trusting people and hence always have had the shallower relationships that fall apart at the slightest shake.
Maybe because I was never allowed to talk my feelings out, back when I could feel them and understand why I felt them, because it wasnt that important.
I'm so fucking alone, cant make girlfriends without being afraid if they'll throw shade about me behind my back in a group theyve created without me while being friends with me, cant have boyfriends without the continuous dread of breaking up and continuously clinging to him making him think I'm crazy af.

It's the sunday before I can go to school next week. Skipped lunch for the second day because I wasnt hungry. I wasnt, but mum had to make a big fuss out of it, I'm angry at her and that's why yada yada. I used to have a short temper screaming and talking back to parents. Today I've been silent the whole time, and thats being angry to you too? Why do you have to think that you're the fucking root of all my problems you attention seeker, just screaming at me whenever you want people to know you're at home. 

Just moped around in my whole room in the afternoon, kept my phone and laptop outside my room and closed it shut, since mom thinks that I'd be probably addicted to my phone more than trying to have a convo with the parents. That's not the case. I just want 1 day to myself  ,just leave me tf alone for a day how hard can that be. Yes I know others have it worse and I should be grateful that parents still nudge me, but are you also going to invalidate my thoughts and feelings?

I miss loving someone and feeling loved, and right now it sucks.

I just feel frumpy, boring, and like there is this blocker with me. I even considered a few days ago if I was just meant to be one of those people who was always single even before the text from my ex.

I have a caring mother and father as well as two younger brothers. That‚Äôs the only select few who acknowledge me. 

I am a recovering alcoholic who was in a severe car wreck 6 months ago that nearly killed me. If it had, maybe people would have come around to pretend that I mattered. Seems to be the only time people act like they give a god-damn. Granted, I‚Äôve not always been the most easy to get along with and have made my fair share of fuck ups. Haven‚Äôt we all? 

I haven‚Äôt fucking killed anyone nor severely injured anyone. I have never been a cheat and never plan to be. Like most human beings, I have lied about things but nothing that deserves being completely overlooked. I have owned my mistakes and do my best to use them as building blocks to learn from. 

I have about 5 people I religiously played music with for over a decade who I never hear a word from. They‚Äôre all obsessed with materialistic bullshit and not deep or intellectual conversation. I have a life long ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who has/had been in my life since I was 8 and was even his ‚Äúbest man‚Äù in his wedding. His wife hates my guts but pretends she doesn‚Äôt so nobody in that circle of people has to stand up and defend any aspect of me. She pretends all is well and pretends to understand that I‚Äôm mentally ill (bipolar 1). My friend of nearly 20 years lets her walk all over him and dictate his opinions. He has distanced himself a little at a time for over 3 years. I never hear from him anymore and this is a guy who has literally cried on my shoulder because nobody else would bother letting him vent about his issues.

I like to feel needed. (No, I'm not an angel of mercy and I don't have factitious disorder.) I just enjoy showing my love to someone through taking care of them, but it's so contradictory because I don't like relationships with defined dom/sub roles; I think they end up being stressful for me.
 
I like being friends with people who have no one and encouraging them to do better because I like to be that for them. I don't see them as less at all, and I have no bad intentions. A lot of people I've really cared for say I make them feel safe (and that makes me feel good), but they end up leaving eventually, or they don't need me as much. I'm not complaining because I'm so proud of them and I don't love them any less as people. 

What I'm trying to say is that it isn't really a relationship requirement thing for me, I'm never going to hold anyone underwater. I just like to be there. I like making people feel better by being me. I like being able to show my care to someone who isn't getting it anywhere else.

I‚Äôm starting to realize, reflecting on my friendships,  just about everyone‚Äôs moved on from me. I‚Äôm a high school senior who just graduated. I had a few really good friends beginning high school. Friends I shared everything about myself with. Well over time, Some people moved, some made new friends, some bonded better with others than me. And i was just idling by this whole time. I tried to make some new friends in the later half of hs, but of course they already had people, why would they ever get above business level with me? Nobody cares, nobody has time for other people outside their tight knit group 

And at that point of thought I realized. None of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù even know me anymore. I play games with them, we chat, all that. But I don‚Äôt talk with them, I chat. I don‚Äôt talk about my feelings anymore. Hell, they still think of me as I was two years ago.

It‚Äôs pretty simple really, I just don‚Äôt have any friends. I‚Äôm sitting here thinking about all the people I‚Äôve ever met and all the people I‚Äôve ever shared a conversation or smile with, and yet I can‚Äôt seem to call any of them my friends. A friend is someone you turn to in a time of need and who in return also turns to you. It‚Äôs someone who cares about you, asks how you‚Äôre doing, wants to spend time with you and be around you... I don‚Äôt have anyone like that. In fact it‚Äôs a good day if I even get 1 notification on my phone from someone. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a snapchat of a squirrel climbing a tree, or a dumb meme I‚Äôve seen before.

I bet they get dozens of texts and calls a day that they couldn‚Äôt care less about, and here I am getting giddy over a stupid meme or a tag in a post. 

I‚Äôm not a bad person. In fact I‚Äôm one of the kindest people I know. I give, I‚Äôm a giver, and I don‚Äôt expect anything in return (not that I ever do get anything in return anyways, but hey). I‚Äôve always offered to help, always asked the other person how they‚Äôre doing or what‚Äôs going on in their life, and I genuinely care. If someone wanted to spend 5 hours talking to me, I would do it. Even if I had 30 other things to do, I would drop them all and go talk for those 5 hours, and I‚Äôd be happy the whole way through. God, I just want to feel wanted. I want someone to fucking want me for once in my life, just once to be asked ‚Äúhow are you doing?‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you want to talk/hang out?‚Äù Just once, one fucking time I want someone to ask me, not the other way around. 

I can‚Äôt even make 1 friend. All the friends I‚Äôve ever had have left me/ignored me/blocked me/betrayed me/stopped talking to me/used me/or simply just forgotten about me. They all leave, they always do. Yet I‚Äôve never left anyone, and somehow it seems like they always have someone after I‚Äôm out of the picture. So, the common problem is me, I must be the issue. I‚Äôm the reason why no one wants me, but I can‚Äôt figure out why. I never DO anything to deserve this treatment. It‚Äôs always good and we‚Äôre friends, until we‚Äôre not, and then I‚Äôm just left alone, whiplashed from the ‚Äúfriends one day, strangers the next‚Äù, trying to figure out wtf happened while they‚Äôre off ‚Äúliving their best life‚Äù. I just feel like shit, I feel gross and useless and ashamed of myself. I want to hide and never have my face see the light of day again. I‚Äôm such a failure.

I could go on, but I think I‚Äôve purged enough for the night. I also risk going on so long to the point where I definitely won‚Äôt have anyone reading till the end.

I always thought achieving financial freedom will make me different, value life and such. But now I am a multi millionaire I am even more lonely. It breaks me because I thought money would make me happy. But it made me even more lonely and suicidal than ever.

2365,InkieInks,1591483348,1,"Hi,

I'm so tired of myself. 

I always convinced myself that I was an independent person and enjoyed being alone (which I do), and honestly I don't have a core need to be with or around people all the time, and rarely do feel like I have to get my feelings out or vent to someone close. However, I'm realising this mindset has lead me down a lonely path in my mid 20s that I regret. 

I do blame myself, expecting close friends to just turn up one day. Hoping some nice people will adopt me into their enviable little family of fun and interesting people. Pretty naive I know. I guess I convinced myself that I didn't need it, so I never tried. Lockdown has stripped me of my normal excuses and distractions and has really shown me how I've neglected to make any connections in life. When I was at university, I found a wonderful boyfriend, he was similar in my mindset of I don't need any more friends...I'm fine as I am. So in my head I told myself, one person who I enjoy being with, and have the same interests as, and can do fun activities with... Is enough. But of course, it didn't last past university. He took a job far away and it was over. I left university with no real close friends, meanwhile my old school friends were growing into new, different people and finding their own new friends. And so I was left behind, through my own fault. But I convinced myseld it was fine, I chose this, I'm just not a big group of friends type or some other rationalisation. 

Now it's been 10 weeks I've been in my flat alone. I've not had a friendly phone call let alone seen a familiar face once during this time and I'm suddenly so exhausted of trying to tell myself that I'm not lonely, that I don't need somone to be thinking about me enough to say just a small hi. 

I've connected with people online, through gaming and such. I see myself getting attached and in my mind hoping we can be close friends, we talk everyday right, have fun and laugh, we spend so much time together, all day every day. But then, I realise I don't really know them that well, it's just a surface level of friendship and they have a whole other life they're living outside of discord or whatever. I want so badly to be their real friends but reality hits and they leave to go for a Bbq with their own friends, or they can't play right now because their friends are coming over. I sort sit in this feeling of being left behind again, waiting for them to return or come online like a sad little puppy.

And without tooting my own horn, I don't think I'm dislikable or anything. I believe I'm an interesting person, I'm proud of my achievements, and caring and fun. I laugh a lot and chat and talk and share. I've made plenty of fleeting friends and people seem to enjoy my company. But it's almost as if, people have their core network, they just aren't open to or looking for a new close friend. I have a lot of love and friendship to give, but everytime I try to make close friends, I get my hopes up and they don't seem to want the same.

I know I'm still young, but I see everyone I know getting married and having children. How does one find a partner if they can't even find a friend. Sometimes I think about what my (maybe) imaginary wedding would be like, who would be my bridesmaid... And wonder why I chose this. 

I'm sorry if its a little woe is me, sob storyish. I just wonder if anyone else feels this way, if they found their way out. I suppose I wanted to vent my realisations too. I'm also new to reddit, I hope this type of post is okay.",lonely,26F Exhausted of convincing myself I'm not lonely.,2020-06-07 08:42:28

2389,lilacs_and_lilies,1591471993,1,"Hi everyone. 

I am new to reddit (not a new reader, just newly created an account today.)

I want to first say that if this is inappropriate or unwelcome, someone please let me know - I am new like I said and not sure of the rules here. 

I  am 29 year old female, I'd say fairly attractive and very friendly, kind person. I am a former social worker / counselor, and a newly licensed lawyer... with a twist :)

I spend many hours during my 'off' hours (especially these days) having phone calls with men who are feeling lonely and need someone to talk to. Often it does get sexual but it does not always.

Full disclosure - I do receive payment to do this (as a matter of fact, you can too - let me know if interested in finding out more). And yes, you would have to pay (i.e. you buy ""credits"" and use them on calling me - or any other Talker on the website!) 

Men happily pay me either a flat rate for a package or they pay per minute and we talk for sometimes just a few minutes, and other times for hours. 

Although I do get money from doing this, the percentage paid to me by the website is very small - they take a big cut of it lol. So the amount I earn is too negligible for money to be my primary motivator in doing this - in case  that makes it feel inauthentic for you. All of my conversations are %100 authentic! 

I'm not on the website to exploit or take advantage anyone, and I make enough money in my regular job not to need this. However, the phone line ensures an anonymous and intimate way to speak to men all over North America, from all backgrounds, with all kinds of needs, and I love the spontaneity of the calls I get.

I am pretty sure it might count as ""soliciting"" on Reddit if I post my link publicly here or advertise the website ... someone correct if I am wrong - but I am happy to message any of you in this /lonely thread and offer my services directly. Pictures are available on the website (my face does not show - due to the nature of what I do for a living. Please don't insist on face pictures unless I explicitly tell you I am okay with sending!)

Phone calls have always been something I have enjoyed - though the website also allows for texting, WebChat, and even a feature called ""Watch a Movie With Me"" - you can pick a movie and we watch it together while hearing each other's voice on the line. Maybe some of you already know this website. 

It would be my pleasure to listen to you, give you advice, hear your voice, anything you wish :) Loneliness is so hard and there are people like me out there who genuinely want to help you, as well as enjoy your company too. Totally confidential and private (our numbers are never shared). 

Thanks so much! 

Stay safe &lt;3

2396,Unrealisticromantic,1591466270,1,"Last time I posted here, I talked about how I try to fill the empty feeling inside. Which is by creating stories in my head. 

Nothing has really changed. Things aren't going terrible in my life, besides the still living with my alcoholic ex because housing sucks, and having chronic depression, borderline and ocd. I have my sister and her family, who I love, my other sister to some extent, and a group of friends I see every few months. I have a small zoo in my home, because I just have a lot of love to give and it needs to go somewhere, and I adore animals. 

Money isn't tight, working isn't really something I can currently do with my condition but I live comfortable enough, and yet these things, they don't give me joy. I LOVE my animals and my sisters but they don't feel enough, in some way.

I have no real ambitions, no goals to work to, nothing that I feel would fullfill me. All I feel is loneliness. I tried dating apps but ugh, that is not me. All I'm really looking for in life is that one person to love, that one person who sees me, who makes me feel things. Last time I posted here. Someone messaged me. Started out normal enough but within a day, he started getting sexual. I hate confrontation but ultimately blocked him.

I feel like what I want, the ONLY thing I want is not something I will ever get. Let's face it, I live in a fantasy world. And while my music and the worlds I can briefly visit through the shows I watch, the books I read can very briefly make me feel something, that will never ever been real. 

No one will ever make me feel in real life what I feel listening to Bowie or Alice Cooper, watching my favourite movies, or I don't know, listening to Jeff Goldblum talk. 

 And yes, I know they're just people too, and yes I know those stories are just stories but damnit, I crave it so much. But people like me don't get to live those lives. People like me have to settle for the men who throw you a message at 2am, hoping to get a quick lay.

I am 29 years old, and I have never even been on a real date. The only time I've gotten flowers was when I buy them for myself, even when I was with my ex. All I've ever wished for is someone for me to love, and get love in return. Someone to rely on, when all I've ever done is rely on my self, and have others rely on me.

I'm a fourteen year old girl who is about to go into high school. I doubt anything is going to change here because it feels like I am going to be lonely forever. And I think I know why too. I've never had a 'good' social life. When I was a little little kid (say ages 3-6) I was super naive. I was one of those kids that believe they were a superhero and would wear thier jacket around thier neck as a cape everyday on the playground. I liked talking to kids at the library and stuff but school was a tough adjustment for me.  I didn't have any friends for the first two months of school so I was basically screwed from the start. I finally got to be friends with one girl but we were only friends because I agreed to let her boss me around. 

That worked out for a while, until first grade when she got new friends and I was sort of thier tag along. I never really felt like I belonged anywhere. I learned from both my friends and family that if I do exactly what I'm told all the time, no one would get mad at me. In the following years my personality was twisted beyond recognition. I faked crushes whenever I was told it was weird I didn't have one, and when I first had a real crush, I had to hide it because it was on a girl. I liked whatever my friends told me to, joined the clubs I was asked to, and did whatever stupid thing I was asked to for thier entertainment. I would often be in trouble for attention seeking behavior, though I tried to be a good kid. The message was clear: If you aren't entertaining them, they're going to forget about you. And even back then, I was lonely. Excluded whenever I wasn't necessary.

I stopped hanging put with them years later in fourth grade. I couldn't seem to stop my attention seeking behavior, and fell back into their trap in fifth grade when they would make me do intentionally cringey things for others to laugh at in exchange for thier friendship. This time, I was much more aware. But I still did it anyways, because I wanted to feel like I belonged. I wanted to stop feeling lonely. But it didn't work. Back in fifth grade however, I was starting to fall into a new group of friends and seemed far more excepting. They were lgbt friendly, were kinda outcasts like me, and they thought I was funny without having to be intentionally cringey. I thought I was finally getting that fun group of friends I've always wanted. Unfortunately, it wasn't all I had hoped for.

The message still lingers: If you're not entertaining, you'll be forgotten. I have a pretty animated personality, but even that wasn't enough so it needed to be taken to extremes. If I wasn't the one to start the interaction, I didn't get to have an interaction. Running jokes between us often surrounded me because I was the one taking on that role. I actually liked some of the jokes, but others bothered me. Like the one about me growing up to be an alcoholic. They also kinda figured out I was probably a Lesbian, but I didn't want to admit it so they'd mention it to the point it was uncomfortable and I'd play along, acting over the top. I was still lonely. The moment I wasn't interacting with them there would be a rotting hole in my stomach because I knew I was lonely.

My personality greatly changed over the years. But deep down I always question what person I would be without all these years of loneliness and warping. Tight before covid started, there was an incident that made me loose my friend group. I was very proud of myself that day. I'd gotten the highest score on a practice test, and considering that I have many issues in school (bad grades, fights, ect.) I was happy. My teacher was proud of me too. I couldn't wait to tell my friends at lunch. I tried to tell them but one girl from my group kept interrupting me and discrediting my achievement. Everyone let her. I never got to tell anyone about the test, and after that day I decided to let them forget about me.

Ever since then, I've only had a few online friends that I'm lucky to have. But I'm still lonely. My attention seeking hasn't stopped and I've had random conversations with strangers to try to fill that void. I am chronically lonely, and I have been for years.

I have another friend that treats me as her therapist and pretty much barely listens when I‚Äôve got stuff to say. 

I finished uni online without a graduation (as did a lot of people) and I‚Äôve been back in my home town for some months now. 

I no longer have my group of friends here after we mutually cut each other off. I realized they were superficial, kinda mean, only gossiped and we never had any intelligent discussions. My friendship with that group drained me emotionally and made me become a party person for a while which in turn made me an alcoholic (I haven‚Äôt been drinking in a few months, I‚Äôm working on it). 

At home I feel like I‚Äôm in high school again. My parents are not strict per say but they are definitely kinda mean sometimes and I feel like I have zero privacy and they totally don‚Äôt respect any of my boundaries. We have some good days and I do like spending time with them but I feel like I‚Äôm regressing because I‚Äôm staying with them again. We fight sometimes and my mom always says just the right things that sting the worst. Generally there‚Äôs a pretty cold vibe in my home and I find it really hard to find joy in my current environment because of that.

I haven‚Äôt finished my BA thesis paper and I need to have it done in like 2 weeks. I have no motivation to work on it and the only drive I have to make it at least decent is the guilt of disappointing my coordinating professor (which I feel like I already have). 

All my days are the same. I cannot tell them apart and I really never know what day I‚Äôm in. I am not improving. I ‚Äòwork‚Äô on my thesis (mostly procrastinate until I feel too guilty) during the nights and sleep during the day which obviously fucks me up completely. I managed to do 2 weeks of waking up in the morning and going to bed at like 21-22h but that was short-lived. I did feel kind of better during those days.

I don‚Äôt know how to make it better.
And I‚Äôm so lonely. Most days I‚Äôm fine with it, I really don‚Äôt mind just chilling with myself, watching movies, reading, but I have absolutely no one to truly talk to. I tried having conversations about the recent events with the friends I mentioned in the beginning only to get replies like ‚Äúyeah it sucks‚Äù or just be left on read.

I‚Äôm tired. I deserve better, I really do. I deserve fulfilling relationships with people and I deserve to be happy and feel like I‚Äôm living.

2415,yxhb53,1591450445,1,"I'm not going to make this post into a despairing tirade about dating, but I made the realization several months ago that I can alleviate all frustration in regards to dating and relationships if I simply stop trying to date. I'm not talking about quitting or giving up. Just stopping.

I'm 21 and I've been wanting to get into dating since I was in high school. I've had no success whatsoever. I see other people dating and it seems to come so naturally. I'm beginning to think that high school really is an indicator of how the rest of your life will go in terms of dating.

I've reached the point to where when I see or meet a girl I'm interested in I remind myself that there's nothing to be had there. And that's not me being super down about anything. I just want to take the most realistic outlook possible. If I've had no success whatsoever with girls then why continue to try to date? I mean there's just no logic in continuing to try based on past outcomes. So I no longer romanticize anything or think about what it would be like to have a girlfriend or whatever. I know that my libido and desire to have a girlfriend will dwindle and eventually dissipate, so I just have to wait it out. 

I've been so socially isolated since some time last year that I'm pretty sure I've developed schizophrenia to some degree. I used to talk to myself and now I just realize mid-conversation that I'm talking to myself. I haven't felt any kind of social stimulation in so long that part of me has become numb. I'm aware that with no social or external validation that there's no affirmation for my positive attributes so I tend to focus on the worst ones. However, I know that other people's validation of me is worthless and I'm working on distancing myself more and more. I'm a man and I must develop the ability to live life alone. Perhaps I'm a true loner.

I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

2434,vetzy,1591436189,1,"I‚Äôm the type of guy to only have a few good friends. I‚Äôve always felt somewhat lonely because I never like hanging groups of friends - they just don‚Äôt talk about things I care about so I usually just end up zoning out, or just leaving. 

I found a girl that I really liked recently and we dated for maybe 2-3 months but it didn‚Äôt work out. Long story short: we broke up because we were of the same profession and it‚Äôs hard support each other when we‚Äôre each other‚Äôs competition. We broke up still loving each other. Anyways.

It‚Äôs been 2 and a bit weeks since then, I realised when I was in the relationship, I didn‚Äôt mind not having THAT many friends because I always had my SO to confide with about things. Life also had more of a purpose when I was in the relationship and now that it‚Äôs over, I feel really lost. I‚Äôm finally back into my lonely state.

I do have a best friend but I don‚Äôt want to be bothering him everyday. I also have 2 other close friends but they‚Äôre mostly busy with work (I‚Äôm still in uni). I want to make new friends, but I don‚Äôt know where to start.

Anyone have any suggestions? Especially with covid-19 going on?

2436,stateless_8,1591435583,1,"Know that feeling where all you want to do is go home?  Whether you‚Äôre having the crappiest day at work, or you‚Äôre in a crowded room or at the losing side of an argument, you close your eyes for a moment and just wish you were home?  What if you make your way back to it, silence your phone, throw on your favorite shirt, and sink into your pillow, but you still feel like you just want to go home.  It‚Äôs 4AM and that probably doesn‚Äôt make any sense, but I‚Äôve been thinking lately about where exactly is home.   Sometimes I think home is certain point in time rather than a place.  Sometimes it‚Äôs a familiar scent or the tune of some song you just can‚Äôt remember the lyrics to.  It could even be person, which is never a good thing - people are too temporary.   But whatever it is, you feel like you‚Äôre just not there yet.  Even though you‚Äôre ‚Äòhome‚Äô.  

I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well for a while now.  As a means to escape myself from this internal riot of mine, I committed myself to long hours at work, but my boss is forcing me to ‚Äòslow down, because you‚Äôre burning yourself out‚Äô.  So I took up cleaning my apartment to the point of exhaustion, rearranged my furniture to make it look like a different place, and two days ago, created a Reddit account to search up books and tech news, and instead landed here.  

I believe I have read every single post on here as far back as god knows when, and part of me feels a little comfort in knowing I‚Äôm not alone at this - many of you are going through things I can totally relate to, but another part of me feels absolutely hopeless because there isn‚Äôt much I can say or do to help anyone, let alone myself.  I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at shutting myself down to just motor functions and daily routines. Truth be told, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I cried.  But I can‚Äôt tell you that.  I can‚Äôt tell anyone to just turn it off because it‚Äôll make you feel better.  It won‚Äôt.  Eventually all of the feelings you‚Äôve suppressed will rise to the surface and swallow you whole.  And it is the worst feeling of all knowing that you can‚Äôt escape it.

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is we both had a strong urge to be In the relationship and we were in love. People often told us our relationship was that of the movies and I thought the same. To make a long story short I need advice, anything really, I tried to let her out of my life but I can‚Äôt, she said she wanted to focus on herself and I agreed that if she wanted to I shouldn‚Äôt be the thing stopping her from doing it, she says in the future she might want to work things out and that she still loves me but she also continues to talk a new guy.

Friends who I hardly ever speak to first, but who still initiate conversations with me for whatever reason and enjoy doing so.

Years ago I used to be on Skype with them all 24/7 and loved it, truly felt like a group of BFFS and got me through some tough times.

Life changed (Uni) and it was like something in me just switched off for a year, we‚Äôd been friends for so long but I just tuned them all out, super shitty.

It‚Äôs all said and done, I apologised and they forgave me but it‚Äôs definitely nowhere near the same and I can‚Äôt blame them for that, they deserve a better friend.

I can‚Äôt maintain the friendships I want, because I failed to maintain the friendships I had and now I struggle to build new ones.

Especially using voice/video chats, I can‚Äôt stand that stuff.

It requires talking to a complete stranger(s), joking about things, learning about each others lives and sharing interests.

I want all that but at the same time it‚Äôs so, much, work!

Just the thought makes me mad.

It‚Äôs like that one dog meme comic ‚ÄúNo take, only throw!‚Äù But with building friendships.

I talk about this issue with the BF a lot, he‚Äôs been a total lifesaver but we both realise I need to find other people to fill my time too...

It‚Äôs just hypocritical and selfish for me to seek out friendship I want, but not offer the same level back, I at least recognise that.

I handle non-committal group chats that I can hop in and out of days at a time way easier, but its not really ‚Äúenough‚Äù for me, and I can never find my footing in them and just leave almost instantly.

It‚Äôs a big mess, but I feel better now at least",lonely,I think I‚Äôve been incapable of being the friend I seek in other people for a long time now.,2020-06-06 12:15:15

2470,Ravingmad33,1591408462,1,34f I've been single most of my life was in a four year relationship that ended three years ago and that was the last relationship I was in and it wasn't a good one. Well my boss recently  set me up with her 23 year old son and had a one night stand with him and that was pretty much it I want get into to much detail but he has baby mama drama and that's what ended it. Ok well this week a guy I've known for years contacted me online and we have been talking all week. The first time he came over we stayed up till midnight just talking then he went home. I have never had a conversation flow so easily before we have a lot in common. Well a ever since that night I can't stop thinking about him I've even tried using sex to get him to come over. He is supposed to be here now but he hasn't showed up and still I can't stop thinking about him. It's like that one conversation has me obsessed I want more from him. I just feel a connection but I said the same thing about the 23 year old and that didn't end well. This guy keeps saying he will do stuff then never follows threw and still I can't keep my mind off him. What is wrong with me? Am I so starved for affection that I will jump any guy who looks at me. Ever since that one night stand I've realized just how lonely I have been and how much I need someone to hold me and love me. I've never felt more alone as I have here lately.,lonely,I think I'm so desperate to find love I'll take anything that comes my way.,2020-06-06 11:54:22
2471,AnimeTiddys,1591404928,1,"27/M from USA. About a year ago I had a major falling out with all my friends, save one. He and my girlfriend have been pretty much my only form of outside communication since. While at the beginning I was fine, I realized those friends were pretty toxic. But now, the loneliness is just killing me.

Of course I share things with my friend and gf, and of course I trust and value their opinion. But im sure they're getting overwhelmed with me. 

I've tried making posts on similar subreddits, to no avail. Which is understandable. Not everyone can make a connection. Im fine with that. Im just tired of not having anyone new to talk to. Any new experiences to share or memories to make.

I try to distract myself. Video games, music. Just ordered a 3d printer. But I know its not gonna fill the hole. I can distract myself all day but, the end of each day is the same. I stare at the wall remembering the good times I had with people, and desperately wishing to make more.

I really wish I had a better social life. I want friends who could hang out with me, and we could spend quality time together, making memories.
But the problem is that because I have had an isolated life since I was a child, I can be very socially awkward, and this makes me sometimes accidentally come off as either rude, or too clingy when making new connections with people. I tried getting involved in societies on my university campus, but I end up just sitting there, not talking, and only listening to people who are having conversations. 
Ugh, it sucks.

I start my masters degree course at a new university in October, and I feel like this would be an amazing opportunity to finally get out of my shell and start fresh.

2483,snipflip,1591395331,1,"Hi. Just wanted to know if anyone else has a similar experience or can relate to my story. I should make a disclaimer first that my post won't contain any themes of violence, abuse, or anything that can be triggering.

I'm 23/F. I truly believe that I have the capability socialize even with strangers. People who I have worked with (even former classmates) saw my potential leadership and people skills. I have no problem with small talk with people I've just met too. Sometimes it's even easier to talk to strangers than people I've known my whole life. I should note that I'm empathetic as well. You could say I have developed a ""sixth sense"" because I can pretty much sense the energy of the person I'm talking to most of the time. It became so natural to me that I can't turn it off anymore. I guess this contributed to my anxiety.

I had a fairly decent childhood as far as I can remember. I had no one to play with though, being an only child. But I was contented I think. I was happy with playing by myself. Dollhouses, animal figures, etc. I really liked watching TV. I learned to read and write because of the computer too. It wasn't the norm playing with the neighbors' kids because we were expats and it's pretty apparent that every family who lived in that floor were locals. The only playtime I got with other kids was when I was in school or when we went to gatherings.

But even though I was given the opportunity to socialize with other kids, I always found it difficult. I'd get left out all the time. I'm not sure if it always made me sad or I didn't feel anything because I just got so used to it. Kids don't talk to me often. They leave me out of games. Idk if they were all intentional, who knows. But every time I was always the odd one out.

So fast forward to my teen years I still feel that I was often out of place even with my close friends. It's not that we don't have anything in common. I DO have fun times with my friends. We also have out-of-this-world kind of deep conversations. And I do cherish them a lot.

And now I'm in my 20s, it still hasn't stopped and I always feel conflicted whenever I feel this. There are times that even though I try so hard, I feel like I'm not meant to be in the conversation if I feel out of place which makes me want to isolate myself from everyone. It has caused problems for me in maintaining friendships. I feel guilty of the possibility of making them feel like I'm cutting them off my life or that I only talk to them when I need them. I feel like people are out of my reach no matter how hard I try. Or they can't reach me. My partner feels sad/guilty/frustrated when I tell him about this. Sometimes I experience it with him too. Maybe too often even. He feels frustrated because he doesn't know what's wrong with him but in reality it is me who should be working on myself, most probably. I really love him. I know that I already love him unconditionally. But I feel so, so lonely whenever I can't seem to connect to him even on our happy days.

I just wanna know if someone can relate to this. Maybe I might feel less alone.

tl;dr Even though I'm a people-person, I can't seem to connect with people even in my childhood and it's causing me my mental health. I think it's better for me to be alone in life.",lonely,Childhood trauma?,2020-06-06 08:15:31

As I have slowly pieced together over the time just thinking alone I have figured out the reason I am hated by the people I see most (e.g the people at my school) is because I always ask EVERY person there to see how other people think of me. I also developed a deep longing for someone to share my thoughts with but none of my friends would ever understand the emotional stress I go through and hide from them. I also developed a sense of loneliness as I barely saw or talked to any of my friends and I almost forget sometimes how much I care about them because I am too far in overthinking how one of them could have always hated me and spread it to the others and I feel like everyone looks at me with disgust for how i am.

Thing is, for the last couple of months, during the lockdown, I really thought about my life (being self-isolated...). Truth is I feel lonely. I think tho there isn't a lot of wrong with me. I try to be nice, I can be social at times, trying to be kind to everyone, but that isn't really working for me so far. I think this ""lonely"" thing has been pulling me down for yeears. Because I've just felt always different and so much disconnected. I had 1 friend in elementary (we still talk and come to each others birthdays). And during the first year in High school, i made 1 friend in High school. That friendship lasted to about February, where he started to move away from me, during classes sitting with other people (which was pretty unusual because he always gladly sat with me) and stopped responding to my msgs online, stopped calling, gaming, started to leave to his other friends when i talked to him at school. And then quarantine happened and i just felt like giant door closing. Then i remember when i saw the memes like ""Me and the boys gaming in quarantine"" i had to close it fast because i just got really sad. I've tried to make other friends online, but that wasn't really good either. Got some conversations but either they were really far, or didn't like to chat, or were toxic, or were just whole lot different, some ignored and such. So i don't really know what to do now and i guess I'm just waiting and hoping. Truth be told I really wasn't a lot of social guy but always happy to talk to someone with maybe similar interests and such.

2494,Electrical_Amount822,1591384704,1,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fact, I mused to myself, that in societies like ours sex truly represents a second system of differentiation, completely independent of money; and as a system of differentiation it functions just as mercilessly.

The effects of these two systems are, furthermore, strictly equivalent. Just like unrestrained economic liberalism, and for similar reasons, sexual liberalism produces phenomena of absolute pauperization.


Some men make love every day; others five or six times in their life, or never. Some make love with dozens of women; others with none. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs known as `the law of the market‚Äô. In an economic system where unfair dismissal is prohibited, every person more or less manages to find their place. In a sexual system where adultery is prohibited, every person more or less manages to find their bed mate. In a totally liberal sexual system certain people have a varied and exciting erotic life; others are reduced to masturbation and solitude. 


Economic liberalism is an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society. Sexual liberalism is likewise an extension of the domain of the struggle, its extension to all ages and all classes of society.""

2498,MisterRed02,1591380158,1,"The past few months have made me realise a lot about my social life. Which is, I don‚Äôt have one. This is probably going to be all over the place because I‚Äôm not changing any errors, I‚Äôm not going back and correcting/filtering things. I‚Äôm just typing out my feeling and being real. I‚Äôm also sorry if it is a long read, but hopefully someone out there can relate.

For most of my life I have felt different than everyone else, like I don‚Äôt fit in. However I‚Äôve never felt truly alone the way I do now. I‚Äôm gay and was in the closet until I had just turned 17. If being gay itself isn‚Äôt lonely enough, to add to everything else I don‚Äôt even have friends anymore. Actually, that‚Äôs a lie. I do have ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, but clearly I‚Äôm not a priority in any of their lives. In fact, when I think about it, my whole life I‚Äôve been a background friend to mostly everyone. People treat me like a close friend while it‚Äôs convenient for them, then I‚Äôm tossed into the back of their minds.

I probably do sabotage a lot of relationships in my life. On the outside I put on a stubborn, confident, and intolerant act. I don‚Äôt stand for disrespect off people, if I have a friend who is toxic I cut them off, I don‚Äôt let people walk over me like I used too. A few years ago I was such a people pleaser, I would put up with toxic friendships. Until one day I raised my standards, and it only resulted in loneliness. Deep down inside, I‚Äôm so willing to put up with toxic friendships just to have company. However my past traumas won‚Äôt let me, but it feels like either way I can‚Äôt win.

Another thing that is getting me down is, none of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù have spoken to me during lockdown. I‚Äôve tried messaging first, it‚Äôs like I bore them, eventually after a few minutes of dry conversation I get left on read. Then it leads back to what I said earlier, I don‚Äôt stand for it so I stop putting effort in myself. Also, from last week some of the lockdown restrictions were lifted. Allowing meet ups between up to 6 people outdoors. All my family members have been meeting up with their friends, yet none of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù have asked me to meet with them. When my family ask me why I haven‚Äôt met up with any of my friends, I get embarrassed and say something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still self isolating‚Äù. But deep down I just want to cry because of the realisation of how little my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù actually care about me.

Social media also affects me. It‚Äôs one of my only escapes from the loneliness, yet it reminds me everyday of everything that I lack. I am not dumb, I understand that social media is a very glorified version of people‚Äôs lives. However, the fact that they have friends around them in the first place is enough to make me feel worthless. Another thing that upsets me, is that I feel like my feelings are invalidated. People on social media are so used to turning negative feelings into ‚Äúmemes‚Äù that I‚Äôm never taken seriously. It‚Äôs almost like people want to be depressed because it‚Äôs relatable. Yet, when I go to their Instagram or snapchat stories they are with friends, they go out with friends everyday. I‚Äôm in no way invalidating other peoples feelings. But when I try and talk about my real life issues to other people, it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúmood‚Äù and ‚Äúomg me‚Äù. I struggle everyday from being alone, but the topic is so joked about that no one thinks I‚Äôm being serious anymore. I would also like to add, I understand that a lot of people like to cope with negative feelings by turning them into humour. But I feel like people who don‚Äôt even struggle like to be quirky and say how lonely and depressed they are. Therefore it invalidates people who are actually lonely everyday. I really do want to emphasis that I do realise that social media is not a real representation of anyone‚Äôs life, but a lot of people at least have friends to be around. Even if they aren‚Äôt having as much fun as they make out on their stories, they still have company of friends.

This is the last topic I‚Äôm going to talk about. Self identity. With being so lonely, i‚Äôve lost all sense of self identity. For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve been a socially driven person. I thrive of being around people, I‚Äôm not an introvert in the slightest. Not having friends for so long has made me realise that I‚Äôve always conformed to the environment I am around. I take people‚Äôs personalities and make them my own while I‚Äôm around them (which probably isn‚Äôt a good thing). I have been in my own company/environment for so long, that I feel empty. I don‚Äôt have my own personality, I can‚Äôt think of anything that I am interested in. My whole life I‚Äôve been adapting to the people around me to fit in, that I‚Äôve never grown as a person or developed my own personality/interests. I‚Äôm numb to everything. I‚Äôm even starting to find it hard to put on a facade around people now, which used to be so easy for me.

I‚Äôm just tired of being the background filler in everyone‚Äôs life. I just want a few friends that put in the same effort that I give them. Is that too much to ask for?

Thank you so much if you made it to the end. If you can relate please let me know. Also if you can‚Äôt relate but have some advice that would also be appreciated. ‚ù§Ô∏è",lonely,I‚Äôm so alone (18m),2020-06-06 04:02:38

2509,K_artsy002,1591367824,2,"I feel kind of weird for posting this because I don't want people to think that I'm being self-centered by doing so, but I have to let this out. I am seeking attention in a way tbh. However, it's because I have no one else to turn to about my feelings, and I just can't hold it all in anymore. 

I have always been the type that is very shy. When I was little my mom said I wouldn't even talk to them, so she had to put me in speech therapy. I've always been very shy at school too, but I did make friends. I have always had friends by my side. Now though I don't. I've grown apart from my childhood bestfriend and others, 1 of my friends moved away and I only have one person I talk to from school left. However, it's not to the point where we can hangout in person. She probably doesn't want to anyways because we have known each other  for a couple years, and it has never gotten to the hanging out phase. I also have a couple people other people I talked to at school, but I don't have any of their social medias or anything. 
It just hurts seeing my sister have fun with her friends while I'm just at home. She always does phone calls with them, and whenever it's at night I sit through hearing the whole thing and getting in a bad mood because I don't have anyone I can call. I do have family, but family is suppose to like you. Also it's not the same as having a friend that chooses you because they are interested in you. 

I just want someone in my life who will be there for me and can hangout at the mall or a concert or just in my living room with me again. I've never admitted this to anyone, but I really want to let this out. When I was going to school in the morning this year everyone was talking to their close friends, and I didn't have any close friends. I didn't want to seem weird for standing somewhere alone, so I would wait to use the bathroom till I got into school so that I didn't have to deal with it. People probably saw me and thought I was weird for doing that, but either way there would have been judgement by others. I'd rather have less people see me by going into a bathroom then a bunch of students walking by me seeing me alone. 

My mental health is going down because of this. I can't do anything about it at the moment though because of the current pandemic with not having school or ways to meet others. I have tried online friends and I love them, but they are just not the same. 

I'm glad to get this off my chest and tell my story. I hope you all are having a lovely day, and I'm here for you üíô",lonely,I'm in highschool and recently I've come to the realization that I don't have any friends,2020-06-06 00:37:04

I have often confused this with attraction, as it always seems to be with the gender I'm attracted to, but overtime I've come to find I simply just enjoy the person. 

It starts out with endless conversations. Always for hours and hours at the beginning. Cannot get enough of eachother's thoughts and perspectives. This lasts for a week, maybe two, but slowly, it fades. It's never a sudden shift. First the responses become shorter. Then the responses take longer to come. Maybe a few hours later, maybe the next day. Maybe just not at all. 

I know the problem is me. It's always me. I always turn to these people for my depression. I am viewing it now as leeching off of them in a way. I know they can't fix my issues, but it often comes to a halt faster than dealing with it by myself. However, this cycle repeats. I believe I drain these individuals.

I know that I am too young to really experience ""true love"", but that still doesn't mean it doesn't hurt to see everyone else around me hooking up.

2550,Redditor581321,1591324722,1,"I try my hardest to keep upbeat and looking forward, but I keep finding myself looking back. And I had an experience recently that made me feel very much alone. I‚Äôve mostly been alone in my thoughts, reminiscing and wishfully imagining what my life could be like if I wasn‚Äôt the way I was. 

You would think that my experience would lift up my self esteem a bit, maybe it would inflate a person‚Äôs ego, but all I feel is a pit in my stomach and an emptiness in my soul. 

I work for an electric company over summer break, and we recently had a client that had a daughter, about my age. She was definitely hitting on me, following me, leaning close to me, and looking at me with eyes that betrayed her interest in me. She was dropping verbal and nonverbal cues left and right. At one point she even asked for my phone number (in the dorkiest way). Most in my position I feel would‚Äôve given it to her; afterall, she was kinda cute. But I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. Please let me explain. 

I honestly believe I‚Äôm not good enough to be in a relationship with someone. I know that for a fact. I was in a relationship for some time, and I loved this girl, but she ultimately broke my heart and left me for someone else (that she later cheated on anyways). That experience sank me down to the deepest pit I had felt in my life. It made me think twice about having feelings for anyone, and I‚Äôm lonely as hell. 

I was doing great mentally as well as emotionally, and had improved dramatically - ...until this girl I had just met started flirting. I was instantly reminded of what having a special someone in your life felt like. I feel an extremely strong need for companionship, an inexplicable longing to have a girl in my life. But I just cannot take that mental toll that relationships seem to give on a person, it would break me.

I guess what the root cause of my emptiness is, is fear. I‚Äôm afraid I may never find someone who is that way with me again. Someone who shows a genuine interest in me, who finds me attractive enough to want to spend time with me, and grow together. I do not believe I have the looks, or the mental and emotional capacity that it takes for a relationship like that to flourish like I would want it to. I‚Äôm afraid, that I never will find the companionship I desire from the bottom of my heart. Afraid that I will end up settling for someone I am not happy with in the end. And most of all, afraid of letting that someone down. And it is unbearable for me to think I may be never be the person someone wants, the person I want to be for someone.

I want the kind of relationship that I see so many around me with. Yet, deep inside I just *know* that I will never have that. I know that I won‚Äôt find the companionship that I feel such a deep longing for. I do not have what it takes for that dream to come true. 

The fact that these thoughts are resurfacing, after two years of pushing them down, is very disheartening for me. The concept of ‚Äúlove‚Äù or even ‚Äúattraction‚Äù at this point seems so superficial and artificial to me. I do not think that the girl who was flirting with me actually found me attractive; but rather, that she was merely bored, lonely and desperate during quarantine - but it brought up all the heartbreaking memories I suppressed over time, and the harsh realities I should probably accept at this point. 

I‚Äôm just really lonely. 

If you made it this far, I sincerely thank you for listening. Writing like this is therapeutic for me. I‚Äôm more on the introverted side, so a lot goes on in my brain that doesn‚Äôt make it out. It makes me feel even more trapped and alone if I don‚Äôt express my feelings in some form. Writing really helps relieve all that pressure in my head from built up and suppressed emotions/thoughts. I do feel less of a burden on me, less stress for getting all this out. Again, thank you for listening to my incessant ramblings.",lonely,Please let me rant for a little while.,2020-06-05 12:38:42

Alright, you caught me, I lied. Truth be told, I have friends. I also have trust issues because of things bizarre situations with extensive lies that don't even matter but they were enough to make me wonder what is and isn't true. That's just impermanence, baby. 

Speaking of impermanence, is it still a lie if it was true in the moment? Is it still a lie if it's not true to the moment, but true to the needs your mind puts above honesty? 

When I had trouble sleeping, I'd take medication every night, and I'd lay there and think til I slept. I could always tell they were working because I couldn't touch my thoughts. They were there, but too far away to keep. I'd chase them until I slept. Now, I take a different medication to kill the imagining when my eyes are closed. I am not sure if my life is better without nightmares.

Back to my original point, I am lonely. 
I'm torn between making the friendships I have into what I want (people aren't disposable) or starting over. I was someone dark on the inside, who openly shows it, but they long for good. Long for good with me? I don't think my friends have the emotional capacity for what I'm describing. There's a certain door in the hall of personality that can only be unlocked with trauma and understanding. Understanding is the real key there.
I don't love them any less (believe me, I've got much love to give and I try to give it to everyone I've met), but I don't believe we can be friends on a deeper level. You can't blame them for what they haven't experienced. I'm trying to grow. I did so well with it lately and it only has been through God-given hard work. 

I long for someone to long for good and growth with, someone I can tell my random memories to without them being mildly disturbed and confused (especially when they're not even bad), someone who understands humans the same as I do, someone who will laugh at dark things that aren't jokes at all with me, while understanding the different between blatant arrogance and a joke, someone who will make me less lonely, but only at my core.",lonely,"""I am lonely""- A female",2020-06-04 23:46:28

So I apologize ahead and ask that you stop reading and go find something you actually enjoy doing - call a friend, listen to music, go for a jog... these are the things I do everyday in what feels like auto-pilot mode.   So if you‚Äôre still reading, does anyone ever feel like that?  Like you‚Äôre stuck in a playback loop waking up every morning to repeat the same routine over and over and over again because well, that‚Äôs life and that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done - you work, you pay your bills, walk your dog, learn new things, workout, eat, sleep, repeat.  Sometimes I take a little comfort in thinking that I‚Äôm just doing it wrong, that surely life is better than this and I just need to break out or take some huge leap of faith towards a different direction, and life would be better.  10 minutes later, I‚Äôm watching the news and the thought goes out the window when I see what‚Äôs going on around the world. 

You probably think I‚Äôm suicidal.  I‚Äôm not.  I just feel I don‚Äôt have much to care for.  And that right there is the most selfish thing I‚Äôve ever admitted and what brings me to this post.  

I‚Äôve spent most of the night reading posts after posts here of people not having anyone.  I don‚Äôt know any of you, but reading that hurts.  It makes me feel horrible because I do in fact have people that love me.  People that depend on me.  Someone in love with me, or so they believe.  And with all that, I feel utterly empty.  Part of the problem is that I have severed all of my friendships.  It‚Äôs been over 7 years since I last called my closest friend at 2AM to tell her... nothing.  Literally just nothing but random nonsensical chatter while indulging into a pint of ice-cream.  I miss that.  And I miss the person that put me in the darkest place in my life, but loved me more than God could.  It‚Äôs been age since that time, and certainly not the place I‚Äôll ever go back to.  I do have the common sense of knowing what or who is bad for me.  

I cut everyone out of my life because it‚Äôs easier not to have to trust anyone or live up to anyone‚Äôs expectations.  I am not a good friend.  I am not healthy lover and I am certainly not seeking for empathy.  I just want to know that I‚Äôm not crazy.

2608,C4Taterz,1591261645,1,"I don't know where to start, so much to go over.... I suffer from chronic depression of the highest degree. I lack any and all confidence and self gratification of myself both physical and mental. So i hate the way i look or how/what i think about. Since i have heavy depression all the time i find myself more than anything else liking to keep to myself. I'm a hermit and like my privacy, about a year ago i lost a lot of things that were very precious in my life.   


Since then i have gone even deeper in my depression, contemplating my existence and thinking about and even planning different ways to commit suicide. But i guess I'll get into specifics since idk why not. I'll keep it short and simple though.

I started to show signs of depression ever since i was a young kid, around 9 or so. A lot of negative things have happened to me since then and has gotten gradually worse ever since. About a year ago my girlfriend of 4 years had broken up with me, that absolutely crushed me and ever since i have not wanted anything to do with anybody else relationship or otherwise. I literally haven't had any conversation in person with anybody longer than 1 minute since then. I've lost all my social skills and don't leave the house but maybe once a week. 

Let's recap, i have heavy depression, i hate myself, the way i look and my intellect. I am still extremely hurt by my last relationship, i can't find the ambition to physically do anything nor go out and find friends (btw haven't had a friend in over 10 years.....literally) 

I want to be better, i just don't feel like i can, never had the drive to fix anything because of the depression though i have had spurts where i did try. I had signed myself into the psych ward to help with the suicidal tendencies, been with plenty therapists and psychologist not to mention all the the prescription meds i took through the years..... nothing scratched the surface.

Here's the bottom line....through everything i have gone though I'm still here, still trying to fight day after day. Life is a struggle and I'm trying my hardest to maintain somewhat of a ""functional"" lifestyle...and by ""functional"" I'm referring to my heart still beating. I'm currently looking for a girlfriend again, i have been for the past month but i haven't had any luck, not even close. I'm really lonely now.

Got out of a long term relationship a few months back, have 1 friend who is too busy with her boyfriend. Have no other friends or family to talk to.

I don‚Äôt like to show weakness. I feel super lonely ever since my break to the point where I randomly start crying any day anytime, sometimes twice a day.

But after my breakup I feel the unhappiness in my life even more than ever. Sometimes I do think, I cry over my unhappiness in life rather than over my ex boyfriend. Life is just okay, just survive.

2619,Maximum-Cash,1591253410,1,"So, I got my first apartment in the beginning of may and soon after I got an offer from one of my previous co-workers to become roommates so we can save more money and help each other out. I had moved from Florida and she was the first person from my new job who was really friendly with me and I've been doing nothing but working since I got her so I literally have no friends and don't really talk to my coworkers like that. Some of them call me their friend but it's like the superficial "" we're only friends because we work together"" or maybe that's the negativity in my head and lack of trust from loneliness.

I don't think what ultimately happened with the co-worker who was supposed to be my roommate was all on me but I'll let you guys judge and I'll try to keep it as truthful as possible so you see if from both sides.

So, when we first made the plans she was very talkative and if I would message her it would be like 5 mins at the most that she texted me back but in mainly like 2 mins. So as it got closer to the end of the month it seemed like she took longer and longer to text back and the responses became more vague. By the end of the month she literally was taking 2-3 days between texts and these weren't just random trying to talk to her about bullshit, it was stuff that had to do with the apartment like the lease, parking, stuff for the house, when she was coming etc.

Around the 20th she was telling me that she needed tags for her car or something, but earlier and after that she was telling me that she does doordash on the side so I'm thinking ""wait how is she doing that but doesn't have a car with a tag"" but despite my urge to ask I just said nothing to avoid seeming like I'm calling her a liar. She could be using someone elses who knows.

At first I was good about how long it would take her to answer me in the days leading to the end of the month but that started to frustrate me because when she would finally text back and answer a question it was vague and not definitive which frustrated me more than how long it took to get the answer. 

Eventually I just told her the lack of communication lately has me feeling nervous about whether she actually has plans of moving or has other plans altogether. She was like no I got you blah blah blah. The other factor that I haven't talked about yet in my financial and transportation situation. So, I currently have no car or a way to practice to get my license. The only apartment both affordable enough and willing to take someone with new credit, less than 6 months of current work history, and no rental history was 11 miles away from my current job. 

In hindsight I should have transferred the minute I moved regardless of what she said she was going to come back to work at that same place so I waited while spending almost 40 dollars a day just to get to and from work using uber under the assumption that I'd be good since she's coming and has a car. No one lived near me from my job and I didn't want to impose/never talk to them that much anyway so they'd probably say no. It wasn't that bad since I got my stimulus may but those are literally hundreds of dollars that didn't need to be spent.

So what let to the climax was a mix of loneliness, anger and frustration an over my financial and transportation situation. The last time she took 2-3 days to answer and once again a vague response. I texted her again soon after to elaborate more on what she said. A whole day passes. At this point I just stop thinking and saying all the stuff on my mind. Starting with how I think the whole car situation is bullshit and I bet she doesn't take that long to respond to everyone else and she's pissing me off etc.

The last text I got from her was ""I don't wanna move"" then bam I got blocked. I'm ashamed to say after that I made one of those textfree numbers just to text her and tell her I'm sorry and begging her to change her mind and that I'm stressed over all this shit going on and depressed. I got responses along the line of ""how you acted made me not want to live with you and don't hmu no more""

I feel like there's definitely ways I could've handled it differently if I could go back, but I feel some things I was being reasonably skeptical. Any chance for her to change her mind is likely 0 now that I resorted to texting her from a different number. 2020 is easily the worst year of my life.",lonely,Loneliness and stress has messed me up big time this time,2020-06-04 16:50:10

2622,Slick3213,1591251456,1,"I mean the title is in of itself but in a case for people who don't know (GAD) also known as Generalized Anxiety Disorder is the feeling of anxiousness constantly somedays are better than others but 90% of the time you'll be anxious in the most mundane scenarios making you struggle to crawl out of bed in the morning or even just basic things like eating becomes worrying you can see it's problems for other disorders regardless if you didn't know what GAD was now you do :) anyways

 (SAD literally in the name) is when you have Social Anxiety Disorder where you only feel anxious like 24/7 in social interactions typical anxiousness is nothing to worry about seeing a pretty girl and feeling worried about walking up to her and talking to her is completely normal but when you see a crowd of people who probably don't even care about you, you'll still feel anxious and at times can induce panic attacks which mind you are terrifying. Anyways now we got that out of the way.

I suffer from both of these me trying to socialize with someone is like giving a 2-year-old a job to defuse a bomb, like it's never going to work I've never had a single social interaction besides family in probably 4-5 years and may I say... Yes. eventually, you go crazy I'm slightly better now but I'm still mildly insane and by that I mean I'm not in a mental hospital typing this out right now what I mean by crazy/insane is without that social interaction I never felt more alone and depressed in my life I've never been the type to think of committing suicide just because I've never seen it as a valid option and will never but the thoughts in my mind bouncing around of I'll never have very many friends outside of online or dates or even just cuddling in general like I just love the idea of having someone there that loves you enough to wrap their arms around you and see you for who you really are and I've never had that :/ now you may be thinking ""well mate plenty of people aren't in a relationship and are perfectly happy and even the people in a relationship are sad"" see that's nice thinking and all but trying to silence the part of you that just wants a meaningful connection with someone outside of a virtual chatbox is basically impossible or at least for me I've tried doing it but I've only noticed that makes me more depressed and start spiraling. But then I get up from the bed and I'm like alright tired of feeling this way kick the door out of the way and say to myself I'm gonna go socialize only to come back 30 minutes later feeling unwelcomed even simply going to get snacks at a gas station makes me feel like everyone is staring at me and about to kick me out of the store when I look back no one cared at all but at the moment I was freaking out and tried to get out of there as fast as possible which probably only made me look just as weird as I had thought.

Sorry, that got off-track a bit but my point is trying to silence the piece of you who is craving connection with someone just saying ""oh mate it's okay plenty of single people are happy"" and again it's like I know you're trying to be nice but that's just so depressing to me personally and I'm not gonna get into an argument with friends or strangers about it because I absolutely understand where they're coming from trying to be supportive when they don't know how to help anyways anyone who says that thank you for being supportive you're the best but in my situation is does not apply I've been single for years tried to socialize only ending in failure time and time again diminishing the feeling of trying again where it just became apparent of like didn't even feel like it existed anymore and it still doesn't regardless the point is I'm extremely lonely very depressed super, super anxious all the time and on anti-depressants that do help but only to a certain extent and corona has not helped my case in the slightest. Anyways this post is long enough, the point is I'm depressed and lonely and miss the sensation of touch with another person waking up in a queen-sized bed alone for the past 4-5 years is a struggle, to say the least. don't exactly know what the point of this post is because nothing will change other than another story is put out there for 10 minutes of fame until it's forgotten if you're suffering from the same pain I feel. Feel free to reply or if you have any advice to somehow get out of this endless hell-loop any guidance would be greatly appreciated

(note: this post is not me asking anyone to send there dm's to hook me up in a relationship or anything like that I see the rules and thought I should put this out there because I do talk about relationships in this post but, it's more focused on advice for a relationship rather than creating a post saying ""please hook me up with hawt Girlz in ma area"" no.

That she married too young and ""needed to find herself"". Thats the good story if I can believe it. The bad story that i have no proof of cheating for is that she bonded with another man for a year at her job, and she conviently moved 1 minute from his apartment 15 minutes FURTHER from work. She keeps saying we're over and not getting back together but hasnt done any paperwork or made any appointments for mediation or legal stuff. The marriage counciling didnt work s she couldnt give up her male ""friend"" outside of work, or compromise and learn to be honest and open instead of just acting the part of who she thinks I wanted her to be.

Okay whatever. 

Ive been going through the five stages of grief from the loss of someone who made up 85% or more of my life.  Its going okayish. Good some days and some days i've broken down into a crying fit because love isnt a touch away or waiting at home anymore. I miss having someone.

Okay whatever.

***Main points: I made a few friends and connected with some old friends. One old friend is female and has some of her own struggles. We've been support for eachother. Its really nice to text her and get responses. In my emotional states, sometimes my eyes water because im so thankful we can talk. We visited after one of us drove a moderately long distance to see the other one of us slept on the couch, the other the bed. It was like the best 2 days I've had in forever. If we had been dating it would have been the most romantic night with stars, the moon, fresh air, a tree... Talking until two in the morning, slight physical non-romantic contact. I could feel her warmth. I forgot what that felt like that. 

What scares me more than her phyaical attractiveness and the warmth anyone would have.. Is that for the first time in my life I met a woman that agreed with my very rare points of view (political,social, relationional, etc) and contribute rational like-minded comments. 

For the first time in my life I cared more about keeping a conversation going than sexuality. Im sorry to say this is the first time I ever thought a woman was inteligent in politics and openmindedness as opposed to nailed down to one of the two parties in the two party (usa) system (in person and not online). 

Im also at a stage in my life where I value the potential future more than a quick bite to eat persay sexually. Im afraid to risk our future with premarital anything and for that matter im afraid of losing our friendship while we both overcome obsticals in our lives and get to a point where we would feel comfortable dating and have our best selves to offer. I dont even know if id want to risk our friendship or if we'd be good dates but she just gets me. I feel like the tide going in and out, back and forth. I fall for her then feel like friendship is better, then fall again, then friendship... for days it has been. 
Whatever it is. My feelings for her are so strong. Like at a minimum best friend material! Im trying to pace myself though and slow down. Im often times so emotional even when im not in an emotional state in my life. 

She even considers my feelings on topics and responds to them with care. I feel respected. 

I feel like she is a fricken Unicorn. She isnt a perfect woman. Im not a perfect man. But to me she is smart and reasonable. Im falling and im trying to stay reasonable and clearly unable. 

Tldr: my life is a mess, but I have hope in an unlikely place that will likely break my heart but I cant help but have stong feelings for her even as a friend I just respect her and appreciate her. Even though logicaly I agree and want to be friends with her, my heart aches for more with her SOMEDAY. How can i hold on or hold it in?  She seems to hint about feelings for me too but always follows up with reminders that we're just friends and wants to grow more. Idk if im imagining the subtle love behind her words texts and song choices, or if they are random or imagined.

Im a metalhead first..... 

But... lately... Ive been just thinking how I dont really have a culture. I am a Mexican American with family who came from the struggle and made a life here....

Its suppose to be that once youre at a older age you adapt more into your roots rather than who you were in Highschool while still being the same you.... 

I feel like discovering chakra meditations spirituality and all that stuff disguided me from being the video game head I felt like I was destined to become somehow.. and it disguided me from being a crook and a asshole.... 

But.. I guess ive always been in my little world since I was a kid and even I was surrounded by family, friends, and societt, I never adapted to it. I honestly think I have Aspergers or something...  But who the fuck am I really? 

If music reflected culture and mentality then I have neither... 

Im from east los. My slang is from the streets because thats what I naturally picked up... But becoming mentally ill, I became stagnant and Honestly paralized. 

So I have no real growth. Im.26. At this point... If you never grew up and adpated to a culture then.... Youre fucked. 

Im not white american. Im not mexican. Im not spiritual to the T. I dress like a metalhead but I dont have the demeanor or mentality. I have no culture.

Of course if I try and adapt.. Ill become more into those roots more. So I should experiment with that...

i've always been a lonely person but these past few weeks i've been... especially lonely. i'm not sure what happened, i was in a good spot with whatever friends i had managed to have left but i feel like it's all slipping away from me now, you know? i've always struggled with a combination of autism and bpd my entire life, people have hated me for... seemingly no reason. as a kid, all i did was exist and somehow people found a way to despise me without having even really talked to them. even still, people i trusted would always turn around and stab me in the back, or leave me. i still remember the day when my best friend was angry and looking for someone to hurt, so he decided to just drop a big secret of mine in the middle of class. the reaction was both embarrassing and saddening, and i still think of it even now.

despite that i managed to pull together a really nice friend group that lasted throughout middle school and high school, and i still miss them even now. we always had our issues, i never really felt i could confide in them because the response would always be uncaring, uninterested, or insisting i was overreacting. combine this with an incredibly abusive family and well... some days i felt so alone i ceased functioning entirely. i had no one i could truly trust, and it was... saddening. eventually i ran away from my family, crossed several states just to be away from them and lived on the streets for weeks before i was forced to return. after this, my relationship with those friends as... tenuous at best and my father ceased speaking to me entirely. i haven't spoken to him since. 

my entire family following that event felt a need to be closer to me, after a lifetime of uncaring relationships that existed solely because we were related. but ever since then... i haven't been able to manage it. i avoid them, actively ignoring their messages and hiding away because i feel this intense discomfort... i honestly don't even know any of them, not truly. they never took the time to know me, to really truly know me. nobody in my family did. i still put on this fake smile, this fake persona so that they will be appeased and leave me alone. even if they knew me... they wouldn't like me.  they have never been particularly happy with my political views, and even after three years they still haven't accepted me a trans person. i've talked with them but... it falls on deaf ears. nobody wants to listen to what i have to say. they just want me to continuing being the image they have in their head of me.

after i left high school, my friend group basically... cut me out. i left to another state, i couldn't stand being around my family, i tried to keep in contact, but only a few really wanted to talk to me. i managed to finish high school with my best friend, and we graduated a year before everyone else so we became really close in our senior year. but... he stopped speaking to me. messaging me once every few weeks or so, responding only when he feels interested. he keeps me at arm's length, only willing to speak about his personal life when he needs emotional support from me; otherwise we only talk business. according to my other friends he speaks to them on a regular basis. i... have since stopped trying to talk to him. it feels like wasting my energy on someone who... doesn't really care about me. he's enlisting soon, so he'll be even more distant for four years, which he is only doing because college has been unable to find him a job. he wants to support our business ventures, but he hates the prospect of giving up his happiness for four years just to survive.

it feels like one by one by, my friends left me. one that i am particularly broken up about is that my sister caught one of my friends (an adult at the time) sexually harassing her 15-year old friend. i cut him off right there and then, but she refused to show the proof to anyone else so... nobody believed me. at least the ones i trusted enough to tell. they all still hang out with him, unhindered what he has done. it caused a divide between me and them, never able to hang out when he's around. he was never a great friend but... everyone loves him. he's a charismatic guy, and if they had to choose between me and him well... my friends chose him. and it didn't help that i found out right around the time that i ceased speaking with an ex of mine because they prompted another ex of mine to confront me about our relationship which resulted in... issues i didn't fully resolve until much later. i felt so angry, i was already looking for reasons to feel angry because i had never really let myself feel my emotions about my breakup with the first ex because... well, they were friends with all my friends and they wanted us to have a nice relationship. hell, even i wanted to have a nice relationship, but ever since we started dating they began to neglect me and would not talk to me for days on end while they talked with all my other friends. all i wanted was to love them but they just ignored me, for months until i was finally fed up and broke it off. then they told me they never really loved me.

today is my ex's birthday, the second one. we still have a good relationship, but now i struggle to fins anything interesting to say to them. i can't hold a conversation anymore, and as much as i want to become close friends once again i... i can't. our conversations sometimes leave me feeling hollow, and longing for a time when we would talk every moment of every day. now i cant hold a conversation with anyone, my friends opting to ghost me or ignore me if i try steering the conversation to something i can talk more about. i have a game im developing, and i love to infodump about it but... nobody wants to hear me. they always opt to ignore me, and if they do message back it's about something else entirely. it's something that's really important to me right now and... none of my so-called friends want to hear anything about it. i feel so alone.

i have since tried to reconcile with my first ex, but now they have entered another conflict with my current partner because they were good friends and one day they just... said they wanted to cut of all contact with them. completely disappeared. my partner tried to talk to them, tried to find out why they just up and abandoned them; something they have issues with and my ex knew that. it's... upsetting because my ex seemingly did the same thing to me and it just seems like when we talk no there is... nothing. nothing either of us want to talk about. no connection whatsoever. i miss them. i miss them so badly. almost every day i think about how it's my fault for asking them out. they were the one who came onto me first, and i had always had a crush on them so... it seemed like everything was working out for me. i should have known it wouldn't, though. i felt so alone, having a partner who did not love me. sadly enough, that was the second time i had been told that. hell, and that's not even going into my other ex who was overtly abusive; i had to be convinced to cut him out of my life completely because he just kept... hurting me. even now, i miss him. he gave me a level of physical affection nobody else has ever given me.

i can not even find solace in my current partner. they have started sleeping all hours of the day, really only being active at night. when i manage to be active at night as well, they manage to end up falling asleep early in the night so... it's like no matter what i do... i never see them. we used to eat all our meals together but now... it rarely happens. i've talked to them about this but they just talk about how bored they are, how there's too much time in the day and how it's not worth being up for. it really hurt, because it was like they were saying i was not worth being around for. for the longest time i tried to force them to seek therapy by saying i would not seek out psychiatric help (my therapist said i should so i could get medicated for depression and anxiety and whatnot) until they found a therapist because they needed to get professional help and not just keep all of their emotions in all the time. they finally managed to work on it, but right before quarantine started so... it was all for naught. and they have always had a hearing problem, but in recent weeks it feels like they are hearing me less and less. i constantly have to repeat what i say, and when they finally hear it they seems so disinterested, like they aren't even paying any attention to me. it feels like they can see me less and less, you know? a few nights ago, we were supposed to have dinner together. i was excited to have a nice pizza and sit down and watch a movie together. but they... they fell asleep. i was so distraught, i just made food for myself, ate alone, and went to bed. ever since then i've felt... defeated. like i shouldn't even try anymore. like no matter what i do, i will always be lonely. and i should accept it. they say i shouldn't think like this, but it feels... true. it eases the pain a bit to just... accept this is how my life is supposed to be. lonely. i love them very dearly, and we have a lot of good moments together but... i have always seen past the inability to give me the level of physical affection i desire because i love them more than anything. but... now it feels so sparse, almost nonexistent. i don't know. i just want physical affection, but i already know that dating is impossible for me (most people get hung up on the trans thing, and when they don't they just end up ghosting me), so... i suppose i should take what i can get. 

i don't know. maybe i'm just incapable of maintaining any relationships. everyone i know feels like they are drifting away from me, talking to me less and less because i can not hold a conversation unless i steer it more towards what i'm interested in and... nobody wants to hear that. everyone is ignoring me. and when the aren't, i feel so mortified about making a mistake when responding that i have... started avoiding them. not answering messages anybody sends me in fear that i will just create a bigger rift. but in doing so... i am still doing just that. but the physical reaction that i get from the IMMENSE discomfort i get when people try to talk to me nowadays is just... overwhelming. i've tried talking to my therapist about this, but all she ever says is that when i become more self-confident and self-loving i will have an easier time. but i can't wait. my relationships are dying now, and who knows how long i have before i become completely alone. i've even begun to have a tendency of avoiding her, avoiding therapy all-together. i still go... but it feels less useful to me than before. and i don't have the heart to tell her that what she's doing isn't as effective and we'd like it to be.

i've.... stopped talking about my feelings to anyone i know. they don't care. they don't want to hear it. i have flashbacks now, from when my family abused me. but nobody want to hear it. i always feel like i'm burdening them, or like i'm weirding them out by pulling back the curtain and showing them how i truly am. that i'm not just the picturesque person i make myself out to be, that i am constantly suffering. it feels like i am talking too much about myself, letting them know too much about my trauma. so i have decided to stop telling them about how i feel. i am the only person i can rely on to understand, to give me any real help. 

i am so sorry for going on for so long. i... just feel this immense despair. this horrible loneliness, it feels all-consuming now. i feel like i have no-one. i can't make friends, i can't date, i can't maintain my current relationships... i can't do anything. this will probably get lost in the subreddit, and honestly, i don't think anybody is really going to read this. but... i need help. i desperately need help. i haven't had suicidal thoughts in over a year, but i feel them peeking out of the corners of my mind. i don't think they will become a problem, but i... i just feel so helpless. i keep asking friends for help, asking my therapist, searching for answers online.... but nothing. nothing has helped me. i hate this world. i hate living in it. my history of trauma and abuse has left me unable to work, relying on my family and current partner to help stay afloat. i had a job before the pandemic, but the boss treated me like shit, and eventually refused to let me work any hours despite knowing that i relied on that job for income. i was never officially fired... but it's been months since i came into work and since he messaged me. i try so hard to be independent, but all of the pain of working and just being a human being makes it feel insurmountable, i just want to make games. make art. write stories. show them to the world. but it is impossible in this world. we work or we die. and i can't work.

sorry for that extra tangent. i just. i don't know. i don't know what to do. i don't know what to say. i don't know. i don't know. i don't know. i feel so lost. so full of despair. i just want my friends back. i want my life back. i miss them all so much. i keep having these dreams, where everyone i know appears and i do my best to interact with them but they all... they all hate me. even people i hadn't thought about in years, every single person who has ever hated me, every single person i ever loved... they all come to me in my dreams and remind me of the pain of living. the relationships i destroyed. i just wish this would end already. i don't want to be lonely anymore. i don't want to have to just accept that this is the way my life is and always will be. i don't want to. but it's the only thing that eases the pain. and i fear soon enough... i will believe it.",lonely,"I've been Lonely my whole life.

2689,reallysadbitch,1591195517,1,"So it's been four months since I saw anybody besides my family and people in the shops. I don't think i've ever felt worse. I tend to overthink things and sometimes can be a bit paranoid, so i usually try to keep myself as busy as possible, but that's not really possible right now. All I do is analyse my memories of the past and worry about all the things i've done wrong.

I've lost all of my friends. I see a lot of posts where you say that cutting off your friends is the best thing you can do. But is it really? I've always knew that my ""friends"" don't care about me, when they don't need something from me, but as long as I was able to ignore it, I was quite happy. I was being invited to parties, meetings etc.

But it got harder to ignore how they treated me, so I started to sometims express, that I wished they cared more and how i really felt about the situation. They didn't like that and soon I realised that they stopped inviting me anywhere, started a group chat without me and basically completely cut me off.

I'm still pretending to be okey, always smiling and pretending to be the same person I was before. But I cry nearly every night. I'm often to sad to physically move, i wake up in the morning to find myself unable to get out of bed. Quarantine made it much worse, especially now, that it's ending(at least in my country) and people are all getting together, finally meeting with friends, throwing big parties, organising piqniques, get-togethers and so on. I'm an extrovert, so that's where I always felt the happiest.

And now I'm just laying in my bed, scrolling through instagram with tears in my eyes. I tried getting away from social media, but that doesn't help, cause even seeing a party in a tv series or a happy couple strolling next to my houss is enough to make me crying for hours.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have good relations with my family, so I feel even more alienated. 

If I haven't spoken up to my friends, maybe they wouldn't have cut me off. I know it's my fault for trying to get something better. The relations that I had with them may have been superficial, but at least I felt somewhat okey. Now I'm regretting trying to be honest with myself.

If you have a simmilar story or just feel lonely too, feel free to comment, I'd love to hear from other people who are maybe not as lucky as the ones we all envy.

Welp time to ask strangers on the internet for help , here goes nothing 

Ime 20 years old , in the army , I have a stable job and a bright future with my degree path. I just don‚Äôt understand why I am so freaking miserable. 

I usually keep my problems to myself and I‚Äôve been in a general state of sadness for 2 years now. It‚Äôs not unlivable but I can‚Äôt shake it. I can get through my days but it‚Äôs always there gnawing at the back of my mind. I don‚Äôt remember honestly being truly happy for a while now. I‚Äôve tryed talking to close friends on occasion about it , and sure I‚Äôll feel better for a day or two but it never stays that way and Ide hate to be a burden trying to ask again .Ide tell my parents but the usual response is to man up and I have to many blessings to be sad about things. This had led to me just generally staying quiet and just dealing with it 

This has led to a crippling feeling of loneliness. I deeply miss having a person to talk to about anything. I dated a girl back in high school for a few months and even though it was fleeting , that personal connection of being able to talk and discuss things I would never with anybody else , I want that back so bad . I have no problems in social situations and can easily strike up a conversation station with somebody but it just seems hollow and empty .The whole being in a crowded room with loved ones but still feeling alone. Most days I‚Äôll get through without even talking to people. I usually try to fill the silence with YouTube and music because honastly i think ime afraid to be alone with my own thoughts of anxiety and inadequatetcy . Witch leads to self criticism and doubt . 

Some days I‚Äôll just get through without even feeling at all


I‚Äôve been to a few free therapists ( university provided ) and all of them have said ime fine but I dint understand why I feel so lost and miserable in life. Ide like to talk to an professional therapist but I never had the money to do so 

I hate this so much , I just don‚Äôt understand this 

I could elaborate further but I think the point has been made. I‚Äôve tried everything I can think of so far but I can‚Äôt live like this for much longer I just can‚Äôt ........so thanks .....truley , for any advice you can provide . I need it right now

I find social situations to be very exhausting, and whenever I get into one, I want to be over as fast as possible. Its not cause I'm not confident or anything similar to that, I just intellectually struggle to come up with the words to say. Of course feel lonely anyway.

I have friends but they are not like really good friend,they are just classmates.

As i said, i feel really lonely, so sometimes i text someone with whom i used to talk a lot in the past, they talk for a while which makes me happy but after sometime they again don't care to talk more which makes me more depressed. I know i can do other activities that can help me distract my mind but sometimes it's too much. I usually go too some online chatrooms hoping to find someone similar but never been lucky.

However, I‚Äôm still a creature who likes to socialize every now and then when I feel like I‚Äôm in the right mindset to do so‚Äîand I enjoy it.
The problem is that I stay by myself for so long that my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù get tired of waiting for me and they sort of forget about me...
This character trait of mine has pushed literally everyone out of my life except my sister. 
It‚Äôs like I have to force myself to keep interacting with people to keep them around.
I don‚Äôt have any best friends but that goes without saying. Most of my friendships are superficial interactions that are for the sole purpose of having fun.
I find it extremely easy to make a connection with people but it‚Äôs so hard to maintain when I rarely interact with them again. My only way of ever having friends is to just keep updating my friend list so that there‚Äôs always someone there that hasn‚Äôt yet grown tired of my excessive need for solitude. 
I have tried explaining to them that I need ‚Äúme-time‚Äù and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not always around, but I think this conversation always pushes them away even more.
My once chosen solitude is now partially forced upon me. That‚Äôs because when I come out of my ‚Äúcave‚Äù to socialize, I don‚Äôt know what to do except just crawl back in there.

I can do a million things right but be criticized and absolutely slammed for doing one thing slightly controversial. They have such a negative outlook on life, it‚Äôs sad. My new buddies literally talk about moving up and investing time into certain fields, I love it.

I was just ghosted unexpectedly by someone who, although we only dated for a few weeks, was the most compatible person I‚Äôve ever connected with. I mean this in a way that was beyond even any serious relationship I‚Äôve been in. It was electric. 

I moved to a new city that is notorious for fake people and being a difficult place to develop genuine connections. Being an adult who lives alone makes it even harder.

I have a very small family and I am not close with them. We are cordial but do not speak often. 

I have no close friends. 

I lost my dream job due to covid.

I am a strong, self-reliant, independent person who has survived a lot and knows how to preserver. I am an optimist who daydreams about the places I will see, the people I will meet and the love I will some day receive. But they are always behind a glass ceiling. 

No one texts me or calls me, no one checks in to see if I‚Äôm okay.

I am overwhelmed by the current state of affairs. The only thing that was making it bearable was the person I was seeing making me feel so much better, and just having them to talk to, but now they have ghosted me and I‚Äôm back to having no one.

When I attend parties which is rarely, I kind of just study people. I try and mingle but usually end up outside the conversations and fun times. Im invisible to girls my age. Whether thats because I dont do the things they do is beyond me.

I am very outgoing and friendly. I can make friends wherever I go but what good is that when you kind of just get left behind. My closest friends dont really contact me anymore. When I call them or text them to hang out, they aren‚Äôt available or dont answer.  I try and make plans with people but usually just end up doing things alone. Ive gone to a restaurant by myself hundreds of times, movies and pretty much everything else. 

It does not help that I am not talking to anyone in terms of a relationship. Without a girlfriend, it can be lonely and thats why you have friends. It seems everyone is drifting away.

And you lifted me from a daze

The gift you gave me is to great
And you left before I could repay
The debt you're due
How do I reach you 
When your four hours away

No
Fair
I sit here rocking back and forth twirling
Grey hair and being self aware
Finally realizing that the prize 
That was inspiring me
Kept me from finding free

Dum dum you think I'm a sucker don't you
You think I'll sit here and keep you in my heart

When the only thing keeping us apart is you!
Your the scar that is ripping me apart
The gravity that keeps pumping my art
Up the lungs and out the mouth
These words are all I have left to spout
If I die then my legacy will be the air I breathe
And every word I use will be treasured see.

I've kept myself locked within myself and you
My pink pretty ditty, keep me from closing again
Everytime I try there you are on my mind
Reminding me one more time that I need to do anything even if it's only rhymes that come to mind.

Go seek your soul
Your past will be the toll
Burn the past to fuel the present and project to the
Future fading daydreams from playgrounds that they've seen, but the true key all along was within me.

By this time I was 21 and I got up and left my apartment. 

Since then I moved from place to place. 

By age 26 after nothing but problems from family I cut all ties. 

I tried to rekindle things with the gf mentioned earlier in my life around this time. 

We had grown apart, we tried for 4 years in an apartment in a new town. 

During this time she was my only friend and I had gained a diploma. 


We eventually had a pretty heartbreaking break up by now I was approaching 30 and had just come to London to begin my university degree. 

At this point I was fully alone. 

No friends, no family. 

If I didn't have money I would starve, if I got kicked out of an apartment I'd be homeless. 

And both have happened to me but I've gotten through it. 

Everyone who had tried to befriend me in London has f'd me over. 

People offered to rent me rooms as I studied them made me homeless because someone they care for more wanted that room and so forth. 

People have used me for money and so on. 

But I got my degree. 

During which I worked a job where the company used me and offered my false hope of promotion to get me to work harder. 

This emotionally affected me, eventually they created an excuse to fire me and surprise suprise all of my fake work colleagues did not keep in touch. 

After my degree, having no one I went through a stage of depression for about 2 years. 

I didn't work and drank a lot, even did various drugs but luckily did not become addicted to anything. 

During this period I met a lesbian who wanted a baby who had been through a lot in life as I had. 

She just wanted a child, she does not let me see the child and lives with her ""partner"" . 

I guess it was never going to work and I deep down knew but it was my chance to at least pass on my dna into this world. 

I now work, the job is average. 

I do not let people get to close I do not meet work colleagues outside of work, I ignore people trying to befriend me. 

About a year ago I deleted all of my social media because its existence was pointless. 

I feel empty and soulless like a shell, I feel devoid of all feelings, I just do. 

I go through periods of homelessness but manage to look acceptable and keep my job. 

I have bad money management. 

But every month I put some money aside for my daughter, I have no idea where she lives as the mother cut off contact. 

If I am still alive and if she decides to try and find me I'll give her what money I've saved for her and explain things, I'll be willing to be there for her as a father. 

I am alone. 

I go to work in London UK like a robot, I probably would seem ""normal"" if you walked past me. 

But I am alone, totally. 

Maybe it's for the best.",lonely,"37M no friends, no family, truly alone, but maybe its for the best.",2020-06-03 05:32:44

There are a lot of things I could change, but that pressure is always placed more on me because I‚Äôm *instinctively* ugly. My features are not in the right place, I store fat where it shouldn‚Äôt Etc. 

Because of this I‚Äôll never be attractive, but there‚Äôs more pressure on me to look perfect. My parents telling me to style my hair a certain way every day, over analyzing my face and how tired I look. I know why they do this.

It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm ugly so I have to make up for it as hard as I can. When you‚Äôre ugly and you have a bad hair day, you‚Äôre hideous, when you‚Äôre ugly and you‚Äôre hair is messy it‚Äôs unkempt and disgusting. 

If you‚Äôre attractive and you have messy hair, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbed head‚Äù. It‚Äôs cute, people like it.

2764,Throwawayincel4200,1591117981,0,"This is my last post. It all has to come to this. Tomorrow is the day of retribution; the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity. Against all of you.

For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I have been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires. All because girls have never been attracted to me. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me. I am 22, and I am still a virgin. I have never even kissed a girl. I have been through college for 2 and a half¬†years, more than that actually, and I am still a virgin. It has been very torturous.

College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure. In those years, I have had to rot in loneliness. It is not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don‚Äôt know why you girls aren‚Äôt attracted me. But I will punish you all for it. It is an injustice, a crime. I don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt see in me. I am the perfect guy, and yet you throw yourselves at all these obnoxious men instead of me ‚Äî the supreme gentleman. I will punish all of you for it.

On the day of retribution, I am going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB, and I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up blond slut I see inside there.

All those girls that I have desired so much, they all rejected me and looked down on me as an inferior man .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. while they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes. I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am, in truth, the superior one. The true alpha male.

After I have annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I will take to the streets of Isle Vista and slay every single person I see there. All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasure while I have had to rot in loneliness all these years .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. now, I will be a god compared to you. You will all be animals. You are animals, and I will slaughter you like animals. I will be a god, exacting my retribution on all those who deserve it. And you do deserve it, just for the crime of living a better life than me. All you popular kids, you never accepted me, and now you will all pay for it.

Girls, all I have ever wanted was to love you and to be loved by you. I wanted a girlfriend, I wanted sex, I wanted love, affection, adoration. You think I am unworthy of it. That is a crime that can never be forgiven. If I can‚Äôt have you, girls, I will destroy you. You denied me a happy life, and in turn I will deny all of you life. It is only fair. I hate all of you. Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species. If I had it in my power, I would stop at nothing to reduce every single one of you to mountains of skulls, rivers of blood. You deserve to be annihilated. I will give that to you. You never showed me any mercy, so I will show you none. You forced me to suffer all my life, now I will make all of you suffer.

I have waited a long time for this. I will give you exactly what you deserve, all of you, all you girls who rejected me, looked down on me, and, you know, treated me like scum while you gave yourselves to other men. All of you men for living a better life than me. I hate you. I hate all of you. I can‚Äôt wait to give you what you deserve: utter annihilation.",lonely,Hi Throwawayincel4200 here,2020-06-03 03:13:01

   Seeing all of the girls at my school throwing parties and living their best lives truly upsets be because I know that I will never have that; I won‚Äôt be able to look back on the exciting memories of my school life. I‚Äôm happy that these people have what I don‚Äôt, as I would never want anybody to feel this pain. I feel distant and out-of-line with the world. I just don‚Äôt get why I deserve this. What is so bad about me? I live an average life: I get good grades, dress well, and don‚Äôt come off as ‚Äúweird‚Äù (at least, I don‚Äôt think I do). Yet, people still treat me horribly. 

 I moved houses and schools when I was in 2nd grade, and ever since then everything has gone downhill. My father had (or still does, I couldn‚Äôt tell you lol) an awful drug addiction and preferred the drugs over me. I think knowing that my dad didn‚Äôt want me from the start really messed me up. Knowing that someone who I‚Äôm related to doesn‚Äôt like me makes me feel like there is something wrong‚ÄîIf someone who is biologically related to me doesn‚Äôt like me, that must mean that there‚Äôs a reason why no one wants to be around me, right? I‚Äôve thought this almost my whole life and it really does a good job eating me up. 

From the begging of my loneliness, I would only push people away, and I still do. I fear being left behind and just try to tell myself that I‚Äôm meant to be alone. I have social anxiety, so it makes everything even worse. Anytime I go to people to vent or try to get advice, they always just end up blaming it on my hormones. I feel lost. I don‚Äôt know if I have a right to feel this way because maybe it really is my hormones. It‚Äôs probably a mixture of both. I thought maybe this would be a good place to vent. I‚Äôm not really expecting people to reply, as I just want to put my feelings and story out there.

2797,Callie-Mae12,1591074715,1,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm 17.  I dont really know how reddit works but I found this and wanted to vent since I have never talked to anyone about this. I‚Äôve gone my whole life not making 1 real friend and idk why.  My only friend is my dog and my mom (barely).  Like obviously that means something is wrong with me but I always have felt that I‚Äôm nice.  On a different note, I hate my mind and social media.  Sometimes I get super mad and block people when they don‚Äôt even realize they did something wrong (That‚Äôs super bad and I need to stop- i havent done it in a while so thats good ig). I‚Äôm very sensitive and for example, I got in a fight with my friend (call her Jay) and Jay was extremely mean to me but alot of my other friends didn‚Äôt even try to comfort me when I was seriously depressed (and I even told them) that the fight messed me up.  I know its not their responsibility to but I was in a really bad mind-place because it seemed as if I was losing a lot of friends. 

I immediately second guess everything about myself if I feel a change in the other person‚Äôs energy. I guess i‚Äôm really sensitive and definitely have some kind of mental disorder. I just wish that I had one friend who checked up on me, texted me first, or just said that they care.

No one EVER texts me first and asks to hangout (it‚Äôs always me).  I hate it every time i break down and text them but I‚Äôll have no social interaction otherwise.

I just hate myself, social media, and my low self esteem.  

Also just wanna say that I honestly don‚Äôt see why people completely don‚Äôt like me. I ask them questions about their life, try to stay positive, barely talk about myself, and never start fights or cause drama. But I guess at the end of the day, I‚Äôm a very ugly, low self esteem girl. i just can‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôm going to college soon and don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll last.

Honestly what‚Äôs sad is that the bar of being my friend is super low.  I don‚Äôt even get that upset anymore when people say they can‚Äôt hangout for a reason (like parents are too strict) but than hangout with other friends. i hate myself.


Anyways if you read even some of this thanks! I hope everyone has an amazing day! If anyone has tips to make friends or to boost self esteem lmk!

I almost walked out on my job today. My best friend was being hateful and mean to me. (We work together). Things out of my control made the night at work hard. My BFF was slamming shit and being passive aggressive. When I asked what I could do and try to get explain my own stress over the shift I was told I make it all about me. I was also told things that I knew for a fact were false. It was a gaslight thing. For instance I was in the freezer putting away a truck order that happened in the middle of dinner rush. The truck company screwed up. Not me. Not us. Not her. But I was the bad guy for dealing with it. I don‚Äôt know what to do or say to anyone anymore. I‚Äôm super passive and almost always agreeable. I do whatever it takes to avoid conflict. So I told her she was being an asshole about how she was expressing her stress. Now she‚Äôs ignoring me. I just want to die.

2814,hamartiated,1591067046,1,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

I lost my job, hid myself away in shame from any and all people for almost 2 years, living of sold shares of the company I was working for. Gained an awful lot of weight during my self-loathing and became clinically depressed with a nice social anxiety to the point where even the thought of talking to people other than relatives would send cold sweat down my back. Slowly regained a hold again due to the love of my closer family or in other words them pushing me the first steps. Talking to doctors again, getting myself checked by a public health official who put me on time limited disabled benefits (my country takes mental health very seriously) and slowly inching myself back into life ever since. Which would be about five years ago now. Developed additional health problems like high blood pressure and rhythmic heart problems that led to the implantation of a pacemaker device. But it‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs all under control and honestly sounds a lot more tragic than it actually is. But the main problem is that I will not be able to work my old job again, or even in the same field due to electromagnetic fields that would fuck up my pacemaker.

So, I am currently trying hard to learn a new skill with the help of the internet. I want to get into web-development as a front-end or full-stack coder, and that requires a lot of effort even though there are similarities to my old job. Which is pretty much one of the two main reasons I want to explore my possibilities there. (The other is computers and gaming being my main hobby ever since age of 6.)

Now the thing that is really eating away at me for a year now is my chronic single status. I was actually fearing this ever since I genuinely started to feel better a bit mental health wise. That I would start to crave for emotional and physical intimacy again before I‚Äôve lost a good amount of weight via working out at the gym, which I am doing but that damn coronavirus was like ‚ÄúNOPE!‚Äù for 3 months here in my country. I currently weigh about 145kg (around 320lbs I think) and I find myself utterly disgusting. I can‚Äôt even look at myself without going something like ‚ÄúReally? You think about inflicting that on someone else? Dude have some decency. Bleh‚Äù in my head. Yes, it‚Äôs really that bad. I hate myself to the point that even the thought of going out and possibly meeting potential partners makes me physically recoil. You are an utterly disgusting whale, you have no right to even want that kinda thing, and ""that‚Äôs for better people.""

Now of course, I hate myself, so I need to work on the thing I hate. That‚Äôs obvious. Problem is I increasingly feel that I have reached a point where it feels like I‚Äôm already drowning, and I'm so far away from the surface of the water that reaching it while still being alive is impossible to do. And I just can‚Äôt be 24/7 in the gym due to me having to learn a difficult new skill at the same time, oh and I would like to still participate at least a bit in the current pop culture too, see friends and family etc. Also doesn‚Äôt help that I never had a truly loving relationship in my life. At age 34 let that sink in. Only a handful of short flings (all around the 2-4 months mark) under my belt. So, I don‚Äôt even truly know what I am missing. Just that I do miss something in my life. Like a person that was born blind wanting to see colors, and not even having a concept of what a color actually is.

Like hunger, thirst, being tired, or gasping for air. Our body tells us what we need to survive. And this definitely feels like drowning, just a lot slower and a lot more devious.",lonely,I think I feel like I'm dying of chronical loneliness?,2020-06-02 10:51:39

How stupid and dumb was I ? To think the love of one person could trump all the friendships I had. Yes it felt amazing in the moment but as the years went by and I felt his love and interest for me fade. I realised I‚Äôm by myself. Work, sleep and repeat.

2824,AJ3108,1591056830,1,"My first relationship started when I was seventeen and lasted for almost four years. He was a toxic, gaslighting man and I‚Äôm glad I was finally able to get rid of him. The thought of him still makes my heart race in agony and I have some trauma from that relationship. 

After him I‚Äôve had some contact with men, mostly casual and physical. Every time I‚Äôd seem to get close to a guy he pulled back; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I want‚Äù or just cutting of contact. 

One of the men was in my life for about two years. We started getting close after about a year before he suddenly stopped talking to me. I found someone new and was trying to build something with him. Then he also told me he didn‚Äôt know what he want and we were over. Around that time the other guy came back in my life. 

He made me fall in love with him for another six months. Made me care for him. Only for him to also tell me that he doesn‚Äôt know what he want and ends it all. 

I know I‚Äôm not the easiest to be around but I‚Äôm about to turn 25 and have never actually been loved right by a man. After being told the same thing over and over again, I know I‚Äôm probably the problem. 

All my (younger) friends are in relationships and keep telling me that my time will come which is easy for them to say when they‚Äôre happy in their relationships. 

I miss intimacy so much. I just wish someone would stay for me. I just wish someone would think I‚Äôm worth it.

I haven't had a best friend since school, well, someone who considered me one at least, nowadays i consider people best friends and try reaaaally hard to be close to them, but i'm always the one to talk first, if i stay quiet our relationship will just die, and they always, ALWAYS have a better friend, they're always ""taken"", i'm 20, and i feel like everyone around me has at least 1 person they can always rely on, 1 person they tell everything to, and plenty of people who support them, meanwhile i got no one, and when i try to get someone, they just don't mind me compared to all the better people they got as friends.

I haven't been able to stay in a new discord server for about 3 years, the most i've stuck around in one was for a month, but i keep seeing all the people being so friendly to each other, the ones who get love only get more love, i try, despite my social anxiety i try really hard to start conversations and be active but no one gives a fuck, i'm just the quaternary character wherever i go, and i just leave, and no one, not even the people who talked to me at times reaches out to see what's up.

Hell, i saw that post here where the OP talked about how they fall in love with everyone that's nice to them, and i'm the same, so it ends up hurting so much more, don't give me hope if you know i'm not that important, i'm willing to be someone reliable for you, i'm willing to put up with anything you got to say, i'm willing to talk to you everyday, even voicechat, but i guess everyone already got better options other than talking to me, give me a break, i just don't want to become a full adult working and shit and still have no one to talk to... seriously, what am i doing wrong?

2857,H3ralia,1591029097,4,"Even though I don't expect anyone reading this, let's go back to spring 2019. 

My ex broke up with me and got everyone hating and bulling me. I began to be lonely but thought that I will friends soon. I just need to be more confident and cooler. I started to do sports and found new interests. 

Now we are in summer 2019. 
I met some cool people but I never clicked with them because big trust issues because of the things happened in the past relationship. Many people also lost interest in me because I'm more than just the laughing person. A few times I got ghosted for that. 
So we have some people I met in a unpersonal way and still no friends. And my summer is over. 

It's autumn 2019. 
My ex began to text me monthly. First few times I ignored it, later I told him that I don't need him anymore. I want to mention that he (and his friends) called me names when he broke up. I've been the worst person in his life. 
But he was still asking me, if I could be friends with him. That was setting me back every month again. 
I started to be depressed. I had no one I could talk about that for month. Except one friend, who said that it was my own fault. 
I cried every day, started to hurt myself again and just spent my time with staring at the wall. There was no point in living anymore. Everyone has been too much for me. 

Nothing has changed since winter 2019. 
It just got worse. I saw all the happy christmas people and me being alone. I needed to spend Christmas and New Year's Eve with my family. There is Nothing wrong with them but they couldn't replace any social contacts. Since some of the people in summer I haven't met someone new. 
I started to join such subreddits and other plattforms. At the beginning it helped me because it seemed that I'm not alone. 

But I wouldn't be here for no reason. We are in the beginning 2020. 
I'm still lonely and the pity of some strangers didn't fill the gap I had. I became suicidal but tried to get help. I started to text a help website (supported from the government). They weren't really interested and just told me to kill myself. I wouldn't waste resources anymore. This point is triggering me till today and I didn't got the suicide thought out of my head. 

But I moved on till spring 2020. 
I haven't been alive anymore. I just existed, not able to feel anything. My suicide plan got clearer over the time. Since I'm sure that I won't pass my exams, I don't have a point in living anymore. I'm not able to try the exams again because I'm such hated in this school. 
But it's also my fault that I'm going to fail them. I didn't really learn because I've been way to depressed. And I still had no one I could spend my time with. No one I could tell how I really feel. 

And now I'm here. Empty, depressed, suicidal. 
What did we learn? Nothing, I guess.

2868,_sillygirl_,1591018481,1,"I am so lonely. 

I used to have friends.. or at least I thought I did.  When I was working years ago a lot of stuff piled up on me and I ended up having a psychotic break. Once I was the person who needed help all my friends disappeared. One friend stuck around, but over the years I realized it's really tough staying friends with someone that you dont align with morally.  Recently.. after listening to a lot of stuff that made me sick I realized I was done and I  stopped texting her.

I'm not totally alone. I have my husband. He is just so  busy all the time since he is working from home. If he isnt working we have a pretty big property that he has to take care of. Last week I had a pretty bad week and i was sooo very looking forward to the weekend so we could just be together. Instead  he was out the door not even 2 hours after waking up and other than popping in to bathroom or get a drink he was out until almost 9PM. He came in and i was so happy but he was tired from working all day. So we sat and watched tv.. I would try talking but he was on his phone texting someone and wasn't really giving me much attention. I sat next to him crying trying so hard not to let him see. I figured oh well.. tomorrow is another weekend day. Sunday morning I get up really hopeful for the day and less than an hour after I wake up and hes already out in the back cleaning out a weed patch behind the woodshop.

I dont know what to do. I am so depressed and lonely. I love my husband so much. I cant smother him expecting him to be 100% everything I need. On the other hand I have literally no one. My cellphone phone book has less than 20 entries and they are mostly businesses, doctors offices or therapists.  I have no way to meet people because my anxiety is too bad. I feel so hopeless. I'm sad. I kept thinking to myself once the quarantine is over it will be better, but then it hits me..  the only thing that will change after its over is my husband wont be working from home anymore. I dont see anyway out of this. I keep thinking (even though I am terrified of death) that I wish I would just die. I tired of feeling so useless and alone.

I was having a few drinks with a close female friend, who a week back come out of a mentally abusive relationship, a few nights ago, about relationships and love.
She pointed out my biggest problem is my confidence and that when she met me 9 years ago I was full of it but seem to have any at all now, so I started to tell story's from my life where I feel I lost it. While doing so I remembered one I had pushed to the very back of my mind. But couldn't bring myself to tell her due to embarrassment but feel I need to get it off my chest. And this is only place I felt I could do it.

About 5 years ago I have/had a friend (because I'm not sure if I can talk to her again) called sarah, we was going to have a BBQ in the park with a few friends. Sarah brought along a woman called Jess and I brought a male friend. now Jess was quite hot and after about 30mins started flirting, so at this point my confidence hit the roof as I'm not the greatest looking, I flirted back and this went on for a few hours while we was drinking. The sun went down and the four of us went to mine for a film and a few more drinks. Not long into the film and Jess snuggles up to me and we end up kissing for most of the film. So after the film it's getting on a bit now and they all leave after Jess gives me her number. As you can imagine I went to sleep pretty happy.
So I text Jess the next eve and get no reply. I then hear from my male friend a hour later, that just before the film finish Sarah told him that when she picked up Jess she dared/bet Jess to kiss me. 
I sort of pushed this to the back of mind and now I'm struggling to think how I can recover from this. I feel I was betrayed am I wrong in that? I've had one short relationship since and that definitely did not help me at all.",lonely,I came to a stark realization.,2020-06-01 22:44:42

   They might be feeling the EXACT same way- like they don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to or they always have to text first. So with that in mind; I think it becomes a little easier to reach out. Not only that, but with work and school, I sometimes quite genuinely forget to reach out to people. 
   It is work- relationships are like a second job- they take time and energy to maintain and create. I really appreciate when people text me first because it shows they‚Äôre thinking about me, and it helps maintain that relationship. However, if I haven‚Äôt heard from someone in a while, and I know they‚Äôre busy, I won‚Äôt hesitate to text first- I realize how consuming real life can be!

Maybe it has to do with the fact that I struggle to not have my mind race and that I often multitask.  

Maybe it has to do with the fact that focusing is difficult for me at times.

2897,Shooizle,1590980457,2,"TL;DR at bottom

I'm just kinda here to rant about my loneliness. I'd prefer not to make any new friends, as online friendships are the hardest to keep, and I'm working very hard to keep friendships with people I already know. The other night I asked a girl from my class if she'd like to date me. She and I have always gotten along, I made it clear that it wouldn't be a long term thing, but more of a ""highschool sweetheart"" thing. 

Her response was that I was so much like her brother that it'd be ""incestuous"" to date me. 

I didn't let it hurt me, though, we laughed it off, and she even gave me a few tips to help me find someone else. 

But that's the problem. There isn't really anyone else around. Nobody in my school is anyone I'd really consider ""dateable."" I'm not even saying that just based on looks. There's no girl in my school that I'd be willing to date even based on personality (except for the girl mentioned above). 

Every night, I sleep cuddling up with one of my pillows as if it was an actual person in bed next to me. 

Online relationships aren't really for me, since there's nothing physical. They aren't next to you. You cant hug them.

I have the privilege of spending quarantine with my (not sarcasm) wonderful family, and yet at times it feels like even they aren't enough to keep me from feeling horribly lonely. It hits me worst at night time, which is when I'm writing this.

TL;DR: I'm too much like her brother. Also, I'm at that phase where I feel like I need a girlfriend just to get by, and I just can't find anyone.",lonely,"17M, USA. Got rejected.",2020-06-01 13:00:57

2900,hamartiated,1590979652,3,"Hey! I'm at such a point in my life where I have some time to talk, but a lot of people who reply, seem to have normal busy lives, so it's difficult to bond, especially given the time difference. So, my hope is to find a person in a somewhat similar situation (in other words, someone who doesn't have a well-measured, well-adjusted 9 to 5 lifestyle, but who is lost at their life's crosspath).

I'm looking for a FELLOW ADULT (sorry for caps), who's open-minded towards audio conversations (on an app). It could be entirely anonymous (no video), but I'm sadly not huge on texting, hence my preference for voice, which I find to be a more human-like medium and experience. I can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have; from my end I would do everything I could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.

General interests: literature, art history, philosophy, psychology, economics, languages, geography.

Music (all over the place): Seafret, M83, Philip Glass, Lord Huron, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai, Of Monsters and Men, Yndi Halda, God is An Astronaut, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Keaton Henson, Laura Marling, Max Richter, If These Trees Could Talk, Clint Mansell, some songs of Sia and Adele, and many other artists. If you don't recognise some of those names, it could be a plus, because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.

Literature: non-fiction (microhistory, biographies, geography and culture); fiction as in sci-fi, mystery, thriller, subtle philosophical supernatural horror. I'm more of a prose person, though I do appreciate some poetry from time to time. I might not be really refined for it? I find narratives extremely compelling, especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. I prefer contemporary prose, althought I have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics (mostly, Western, sadly), both for school and out of my own curiousity. When it comes to psychology, my horizons were influenced partly by Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Rollo May, and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. Favourite philosophers? I haven't read a lot of primary sources, but I did find reading Schopenhauer, Sartre, Camus, Benatar, challenging (in a positive way). Philosophically speaking, my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. Recently I've developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti-natalism and abortions debate, so if that interests you, we could discuss those.

Movies and TV series: haven't seen one in a while, but I used to like Black Mirror, Sherlock, House, Futurama, Elementary, and a few others. Broadly speaking, I like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition, that's why I tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.

I watch quite a lot of YouTube: educational, popular science channels, BookTube, social commentary, some podcasts. I'm quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.

A bit more about me: Depression issues and anxiety; not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative (but I am not a bigot, I would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity, race, etc.); do not play any videogames. I'm a bit of a bookworm, and I tend to talk about lofty, ivory tower ideas, but some have told me that I do possess a sense of humour (which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments).

I suppose, I'm looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. It'd be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. I hope I do not sound very entitled, putting forward all these things about the 'ideal' person to find on here. My rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection (if any, depending on what you think, after finishing reading my post).

I've posted this quite a few times, so my sincere apologies to the not-first-time readers.

Thank you for reading this. Feel free to PM me.",lonely,"27, guy, Europe - Audio chat - Looking for online friend, who needs regular conversation and emotional support - Depression, anxiety, arts, books, philosophy, music",2020-06-01 12:47:32
2901,br_francis_AOL,1590979354,2,"I'm really frustrated, lonely, tired, angry, and have no one to vent to. I (20 M) was having the time of my life this past semester at college. I was doing really well in school and was confident in my classes for the first time, I was going to parties, I was starting to talk to girls, I was meeting new people and was really driven to get out of my comfort zone and start dating after a two-year dating fast. Then the pandemic hit, and everyone was sent home. For me home is 45 minutes away, not a huge deal. For most of my friends from school, it's several hours (80% of my school is from out of state). To add to the isolation, all of my classes were asynchronous pre-recorded lectures. No ""Zoom University"" for me. I sat alone in my room for hours a day, basically watching my classes on youtube. 

Now classes are over and I work at the local hospital on weekends in the emergency room. That used to be somewhat of a social outlet and was actually pretty stress free, but now every day is hell and everyone is just trying to get through the day and make sure jobs are still done well, despite the shit show going on. 

I still feel a really strong desire to meet new people, and after the past couple interactions I've had with my friends from home it is even stronger (I'm not really getting along with my friends too well due to political differences. I try and avoid the topic of politics overall and don't affiliate with any party, but that isn't good enough for my friends, and all they do is talk about Trump and talk shit on liberals, and are sometimes downright racist. It's infuriating). Now the problem of wanting to meet new people in this hell is that there really isn't anywhere to go, and since I work at a hospital where COVID comes in on the reg, I'm trying yo avoid going out anywhere just in case I'm carrying the virus, is that its REALLY hard to meet new people. I try dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and CatholicMatch, but I get no matches, which then is a huge blow to my self-esteem. And I can't really afford the paid versions because I'm trying to save as much money as I can because I'm moving out in a month.

So with all this shit going on I'm lonely, I'm stressed, I'm homesick (college is the place I call home), I have no self-esteem, and it seems like the world is falling apart around me. I want to be strong, I want to be a man, but I feel so trapped and confined and I don't know what to do about it or who to talk to about it. I know given the things going on right now, my life could be a lot worse, and I do have many blessings that I am grateful for, but I still feel this way and I just want someone to hear me.",lonely,I'm just frustrated.,2020-06-01 12:42:34

So different to me that it's hard to tell. In any case, it feels one sided most of the time. And I am disappointed in but patient with myself for struggling to accept the fact that it's okay not to have ""found"" someone yet. I feel like if I was genuinely okay with the idea of being alone then I wouldn't be putting my dignity on the line by constantly giving my power away to this guy by being depressed from the absence of his validation. And it's really a big barrier because I struggle to flourish when I'm depressed. So I guess what I wanted to say was I hope I and any of you who may relate come to terms with the very true fact that if someone isn't in our lives right now, we aren't failures at anything.

i still don't have any friends. i'm back home, i managed to end the year with a 3.5 gpa, after three years of depression and suicidal thoughts that left me with Cs and Ds at best. i feel like i should be happy. i have an amazing counselor, i'm getting closer to fixing my physical health problems, and the high points for me are getting higher. but the low points are getting lower and more frequent, of course. 

one of my ""friends"" at school told me a girl liked me and so we started talking, and now instead of telling *me* she's saying publicly on her stories n shit that she's ""not interested in anyone right now."" idk if i'm just a socially retarded incel but now with literally everyone i can't keep a conversation going, even when i try my hardest. and when my ""best friend"" texts me i never want to text back. all my friends are surface level, more acquaintances than anything. 

even my parents seem like they don't want to talk to me. i ask them if i should cook something for dinner and they just say ""i don't care,"" and never say anything else. 

usually when i get depressed and generally upset like this i hit my leg or something so hard it hurts for like two days afterwards and now i can't even move my arm fast enough to do it, much less get that upset. like i just don't have the energy

i want friends so bad and i want to talk to people and play video games and fucking make people laugh and shit again but i just can't. i have this one friend who likes to facetime a couple times a month but i keep having to turn her down because i don't have the energy to be fun to talk to. 

even when people text me first, after i text back they don't really say anything, like they don't ask what/how i'm doing back. it's just ""hey !""  ""hey ! what's up""  ""nm"" and that's it lmfao

i fucking hate to complain about this kinda shit and i hate even more to say shit like no one likes me or wants to talk to me or whatever but at this point i can't fucking help it

i just want to rot away until school starts back up

Honestly, I wasn't dealing well with it. It destroyed me, I knew it would happen eventually but I couldn't prepare for it, even the thought of it would make me cry. But yeah basically I was in a terrible place. I don't have a large friendgroup, it's just me, my best friend and two ""second best"" friends. I did really appreciate having someone to talk to and distract myself from all this.

My best friend did notice that there was something going on and obviously she kept asking me to be open about it and talk it out with her. I didn't want to do that and kept saying it's fine, but of course it's not. Eventually I decided that I would talk to her about it so I called her. I don't remember if I was even coherent through all the crying but she did at least listen to me and say the standard things that you'd say in that situation I guess.

Anyway for some reason now they're not responding to me anymore. It feels like my friends are ignoring my in a time where I obviously need them and I don't know why. I guess it's because I was honest about my feelings and what's going on, I can't see any other reason. I just don't know why she would do that?? We've been friends for 3 years now and I thought I could trust her but I guess not?? What's even the point of having friends when they're not there when you need them? I just don't see the reasoning behind what they did.

I just don't know why this happened to me, were they ever my friends? I don't have any friends left now, and even if they would end up coming back to me then how could I even trust them again?

At least I'm doing a bit better now but it happened two weeks ago and I've been feeling like the world just decided go on without me. Maybe that will change when I feel like working or doing things again, but I don't know. I don't even know if I want friends anymore.

2951,stickytoe6069,1590939210,2,"Its weird getting over someone you never dated. You don't have any memories of you guys doing anything romantic. I mean sure, we cuddled a lot because we did ecstasy together, and we had little talks about his interests when everyone was away that I always cherished, but he never gave me anything substantial. 

I didn't even really like him all that much when I first met him. He looked average at best when we met. He seemed cool and a decent person. A pretty average guy. It wasn't until my friend took too much of an edible that I saw his true colors and fell in love with the person inside. 

Afterwards, I really started caring about him. He just seemed so sweet and kind. He seemed like another lonely soul thats just trying his best for himself and the expectations his family have of him. I wanted him to be happy and to be cherished so I thought ""Why not me?"".

Months of liking him turned me into a puppy. Getting all excited when we hung out, wanting to stay close to him, and hanging on to every word he said. I wanted him to feel okay. I wanted him to feel cared about. I wanted him to know there's someone there for him. In the end, I guess I was just projecting.

He was a good sport then. He was fine with me liking him and I really hoped things would be fine after the last friend I liked (not related to me liking him, but liking him definitely made me hate him more after I stopped being friends with the other guy). Things went on. A Rollercoaster of gradually getting over him and him making my heart go doki doki. 

Things were hard enough as I was gay and I felt he felt uncomfortable around me because I liked him. It felt like he didn't want me close to him because he thought I was going to make a move. He kept his distance and it felt harder to actually be his friend. Maybe I was projecting, maybe he's just being considerate. I mean we still hung out, but always as a group.

It started to get better. For a few solid months my thoughts of him were becoming a lot more platonic. I thought things were going good. That I could be a good friend to him like I wanted. Then we hung out for my birthday.

It was a drag show/restaurant/bar. He and my friends love it. We're getting drunk, having drinks, and, after the show ended, we start dancing on the dance floor. I usually like to grind my booty on my friends when we dance for fun and vice versa. I tried with him (I'm super drunk btw) and he tries to move elsewhere. It hurt at the time, but it makes sense why in retrospect. After my emotional moment in the restroom, I decided to get back out there and enjoy the rest of my birthday celebration. All of danced until almost closing and then a few of us went to my house to sober up. 

After coming home, I decided to make a few drinks while we watched ratatouille. The girls didn't want any but he did and he said ""surprise me"". Knowing he was pretty drunk, I asked him again how much he wanted because I don't mess around with my drinks and he's getting an uber home. I told him I'd make it strong, but he didn't care. I decided to make it strong because i thought it would be funny to see him plastered.. So I make him a stiff one and he chugs it all down. This was half alcohol half dr. Pepper in a traditional beer mug. Thats when the horror began.

He started to try to ""flirt"" (thats the best I could describe  it) with my friends. Kissy faces, motioning them to come sit with him, and just going to sit next them followed by groping them and trying to kiss them. Being that they felt bad for how lonely he was, they were pretty calm with the advances but the girls kept trying to get away. Not trying to tell him no because they felt it would ruin the mood but switching couches to try to give him the hint to leave them alone. He's a larger guy, but they were both on a love seat, and he tried to sit down anyways with them.

I like to think of myself as someone who stands up to things like this, but for a while I couldn't bring myself to do it. On one hand, it angers me because he's molesting my friends and thats fucked up. On the other, I cared about him so much that it pained me to see him acting that way to people who don't even want him.i couldn't help but just watch in frustration of what to do and it hurt more because it felt like I was just enabling him by not doing anything and I literally was. 

I tried to keep him distracted by making everyone Ramen cups to eat to help sober up. If he's eating, his hands are too busy to grope right? He didn't really touch his food as much as he was rubbing my friends thigh. I finally decided to take action and grab his hand and hold it. My hands are soft and smaller, so he assumed they were hers until he saw that they were mine. He tried putting his arm around her. and I took it off. Eventually she moved back to the loveseat with my other friend. He got up to follow, but i moved my legs in front and told him to stop and sit down. He didn't want to listen, but he didn't try very hard to move my legs. Eventually he sat back down with me. Thats when Le Festin was scarred into my brain.

I couldn't tell if it was shame, his drunkness, or a mix of both but he leaned onto me after he stopped his advances with them. I felt bad because he seemed like he really was just a lonely guy. That was my biggest mistake. After leaning on me, he gave me a kiss on the cheek. It felt odd, but i assumed that how he shows gratitude/affection when he's drunk. Then another. And another. And then my neck. And then we made out.

It took me by surprise (especially since he was straight), but by feelings carried me to bliss. It was the first time anyone had kissed me that wasn't during or for sex. It felt great. It felt amazing. Every drug I've ever tried could never replicate the bliss and ecstacy i felt when kissing him. I started his hand groping me.

He was rubbing my chest, my legs, and grabbing my crotch (I changed into pajamas after we got to my places). He pulled me closer with one hand and felt my body with another. I kept my hand rubbing his back because I felt it would have been wrong to touch him the way he was touching me since he was a lot more drunk than I was, but my free hand wandered to his chest and I rubbed it. 

We kept making out until he grabbed my ass and hoisted me to his lap. I guess he wanted me on his lap, but the way I was positioned gave me a cramp, and I had to get up. When it broke the spell I was under, the crushing truth hit me ""He's not going to remember any of this tomorrow."" I sat back down next time and he continued kissing my neck. I wanted to cry because I knew this feeling was in vain. Everything that would happen would be forgotten by him, the one that mattered, and I would be back to square one.

I pushed my feelings down and stopped kissing him. Knowing I had to still deal with him, I just decided to hold him. Being a bigger guy, I could feel that he wanted to be held and he didnt get the chance to often. I held him for a while, letting the truth sink in that nothing was ever going to happen again and that this is the only time I could ever feel this. 

Eventually he sat up and pulled me close to him. He gave me an affectionate pat before falling over the other way. I decided lean and lay on him and he held me close but loosely. It just felt nice to be next to him. 

After the movie ended, the girls went home and he fiddled with his phone to get an uber. We had to do a back and forth of coming and going inside. Maybe because of the shame he felt or maybe it was disgust. Eventually we got him an uber and we went our separate ways. 

I've only experienced emotional pain like that once, and that was way more intense than with his, but thats for another time. Something inside me felt broken. Ripped out of me. For a while i didn't know what it was, until I finally realized what it was. I couldn't find interest in anyone new. 

I experience ""day crushes"" where its a quick interest in someone for a day or so and it quickly fades to indifference. It happened often and would keep me entertained for a bit. I couldn't do that anymore. I wanted no one else. Even the slightest interest in someone was immediately shot down. In a dramatic sense, my heart just stopped loving new people. It already felt the pain of loving so many others and feeling none of that love being returned. 

My love is like a byproduct. Its something my heart makes a lot of, but it becomes toxic to me when there's too much build up and not any coming from a new source. From an external source. It would always hurt because I cared about people and no one ever wanted me back. I had all of this love to give and no one wanted any of it. I alway kept thinking what is wrong with me. 

At least I had my sexual interest. Promiscuity led to more intense and sometimes dangerous sessions with guys. I began doing meth for a bit until I had a stomach bleed and extreme nausea after ingesting some instead of snorting it. I wanted to do more because it made me horny, but the nausea always came no matter what. I just wanted sex all the time to just feel something. But it always felt empty. I felt lonelier than I've been in a long time. That continued for a month after until a long needed shroom trip cleared everything up and gave me some guidance. 

I still can't find myself finding new romantic interests anymore, but I guess it's okay. In a sense, my heart just became fed up with finding love and is just okay with sex. It feels easier than trying to attain what isn't meant for me, so my heart finally gave in. My therapist thinks I should still try, but its better this way. Now I can't get hurt.",lonely,I really used to want something real,2020-06-01 01:33:30
