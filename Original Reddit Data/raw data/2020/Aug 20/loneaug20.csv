Okay here we go, on mobile so I'll do my best.... I (M26) started talking to an old friend friend (F23) who i met on vacation about 6 years ago. We only ever met each other for a few hours, but we exchanged numbers. We kept in touch for the most part but lost contact when she had a boyfriend (2 or 3 years ago?). 


In November 2019, i decided to try and message her to see how everything was going. Turns out we were both single and we were talking everyday and things were looking promising. We like the same activities, both dont really drink, we shared a lot of feelings between each other.

I was working out of town when covid hit and i got laid off right away (i knew it was coming a long time ago, so i was prepared and decided to take the summer off). My friend and I were talking (from march until mid april) about me going down there this summer to temporarily live together to see how things would go and maybe I could find work there or something, a big step but i was ready (i really liked the girl). Later in April she mentioned she was talking to another person who interested her but said she would still like to talk to and to see me. Mini heart attack, but hey she still wants to see me.

I made the drive (end of april) and took all safety precautions in consideration for the pandemic (sanitizer, wipes, faceshield ect). I stayed at an airbnb as she changed her mind about staying with her (covid related, no biggy). 5 days of laughs, colouring, board games, and flirting later it was time for me to go.

I really liked seeing her and really fell for her. When i got home she wasnt messaging me as much (maybe a hello or im busy text every few days). I knew she had a lot going on so i tried respecting that. I got to a point where i wanted to know what was going on or what was wrong because things changed so much (about 2 weeks after i got home). She normally told me things going on in her life, good news or bad, so i was kind of concerned.

After seeing her i knew i was in love, but she wasnt ready for a relationship....thats fine, i like what we are doing so i can wait. I never tried hiding my feelings, i told her i loved her and she still wanted to remain friends regardless (i mean she let me visit her after i told her i loved her). 

I told her i was having problems that we werent talking as much and how i wanted to talk about what we both wanted. She was too busy. This continued until mid July and i said i couldnt do this because i love you and i dont know how to deal with this if you cant talk to me. She said it made her sad, which took me off guard because i didnt think she cared anymore. Thats when she didnt even want to talk anymore and ive been trying really hard to talk to her to to try and figure out what went wrong.

I was having a really hard time because this was my first love and my first heartbreak and i was just trying to see what changed all along. I was trying to be as respectful as i could with giving her space (i didnt call her, and i messaged her anywhere from 1 to 3 times a week, which is what i thought to be reasonable). 

That brings us to now, we are no longer talking. I lost a friend whom i loved, and i could share anything with. There isnt anyone else i feel comfortable with to sharing these feelings and i just wanted to get this off my chest. Granted i was being pretty annoying and immature by the end of it.... I never wanted to lose my friend. 


She said it wouldnt be healthy to be friends if i had those feelings (it didnt bother her before) and shes probably right....but i think that if there was a slight chance she could be happy with me and that i could be happy with her then it would be worth it. 

Kind of long and i missed a few details but thats the gist of it, sorry for the rant. Like i said, i lost a friend who i could tell everything to, so here i am telling you guys. To be honest, its probably for the best but im just having a hard time with these feelings because its the first time i felt either.

I feel like it was all my fault, but im not sure what i did, and im not sure how to move on.",lonely,I lost a good friend and i dont know where things went wrong...,2020-08-31 23:49:29

5,Successful-Bat5301,1598871354,1,"I have a wife and 2 kids and no friends. Quite frankly, my wife is not a good person. While before we married and had kids I thought things were really good but in retrospect it was entirely because we always only did what she wanted. Everything was on her terms - the food we ate, the movies we watched, the places we'd go to. If I wanted to do something, I had to do it alone. 

She took zero interest in anything of mine, from my hobbies to my work to my relatives and friends. Most of the time when I talk she tunes me out and interrupts me to talk about what she wants. I tried so many times confronting her about it and she'd try half-heartedly about a day or two each time before reverting to her old ways. I've given up. I turn 34 in a few days and I'm 100% convinced she'll forget it. Last time she only greeted me because I got a call from my sister living abroad greeting me.

We had kids because she wanted to and promised me it wouldn't get in the way of my dreams and career, which I was at the time heavily invested in. But that didn't happen. Once she stopped breastfeeding, everything fell on me as she got into mobile gaming and online friends and all but stopped talking to me except to share gossip about her online friends. She ignores our kids all day long, every day and I took up working dead-end jobs from home. She has no interest in work and wanted to be a housewife by her own admission, but refuses to actually do anything.

My friendships died because my wife was initially so codependent I couldn't spend much time with anyone else, and now because I have to take care of our kids, cook and clean because if I don't the kids will sit in their own filth, starve and possibly hurt themselves - I've tried to see if she'd step in but she never does. We've been in a perpetual state of ""when I get back into being a housewife, it'll be better"" for years and years. She tells me she loves me every day but she barely knows me. It's just because I pay for everything, make sure she has clean clothes and feed her good food and let her be. At this point it's easier to deal with her gaming than when she'd be ""interacting"" with me all day only to hear herself talk.

I have two kids who adore me but they're very young and I refuse to talk to them about anything of mine since I grew up with a single mom who talked to me as a ""friend"" instead of as a parent, which messed me up for a long time.

Most of my family has now passed and I was never good at making friends but now, being a de facto single dad who works from home in my 30s, it's impossible. Most days I only talk to my kids and no one else. My wife hasn't touched me in months, always saying she's tired from gaming all day long, every day. Instead she encourages me to watch porn. Last present I got  for Christmas was that I would be ""allowed"" to use the VR set I bought for her to watch VR porn occasionally. Her online friends don't know about me or the kids at all while she tells her folks that she's a dutiful housewife while I'm hard at work.

When the kids are old enough, I'll file for divorce because I know she's vindictive enough to want to take them from me if they aren't and her family's loaded so I know they have the means to fight me on it. They're the only thing keeping me going and the only reason why I don't regret my marriage.

For now, I have no one, my dreams are dead and all I can hope for is to be a good enough dad to offset what my wife is doing. The kids are actually great about it - they've just rolled with me being the only parent and treat my wife like she's an inoffensive stranger houseguest.

But I get lonely. I start thinking about my old friend group from high school, ex-girlfriends, but particularly an old high school friend I had a crush on but was too stupid to act on, despite her showing interest. It's been over 15 years since I last heard from her and I still think about her almost every day. I hope she never marries so maybe, one day when we have another reunion (I wasn't allowed to go to the one that was a few years ago), we'll both be single and I could get my old life back with my friends. Only 10+ years to go.",lonely,Anyone lonely with a family?,2020-08-31 20:55:54

17,bl1nd_06,1598857252,1,"
I am 21 year old guy and I have been a loner since I was 3. It is my birthday this sunday so I am just getting some analytics of my life.


The reason why I find it very hard to get out there is I had a very rough childhood. I was never loved, I dint have anyone to talk to or anything despite being in a joint family. There were 16 people in the house and I was a special (dyslexia) child so no one wanted to take care of me. I never had birthday parties or anyother celebrations. The worst part about it is all the other kids in my home got to celebrate everything. 

My parents dies when I was 16 and my grandparents threw me out of that house due to issues between some people. Lucky for me my father’s friend was kind enough to sublet a tiny appartment. I worked to pay for school and put more and more time into learning and slow started to make a life for myself. That was when I decided to act on a crush that I had on this girl from school. 

She rejected me at first but after a year maybe more she said yes and we were in a very serious relationship. She was like the first best friend I ever had. I started sharing stuff about my life. Thats when I found many truths about myself. I dont like birthdays, gatherings, parties, chocolates etc. It was really hard couple of years into our relationship. I tried to be okay with everything but I could not. That was not me and she could not understand it. She started to drift away. She started spending more time with her friends and other guys from school. I dint say anything. I believed that she needs a break and I need to work on myself. 

After a while we were just barely talking. Then on her birthday I decided I am going to get past my childhood and surprise her with a present. She was the first to come to class always and I thought of going there before her that day and give her a present. I wish I never did that. I saw her making out with another guy with his hands all over her and she was enjoying it. (I never got physical with her because she was not 18 then) She saw me and I never saw any regret. She just had a naughty laugh in her face and she came to and said “You know this was coming. Come on.. how can I spend my life with you. You are not that good looking and soooo boring. That was the most toxic and depressing part of my life and now I am actually happy. So please dont make a scene and go away please.”

I ran away. I felt so worthless. I was fading. I went to the rest room and I puked. I was crying, hitting myself, tearing my skin. I ran home that day. I dint eat or drink water for three whole days. I could not get over it. I decided to quit. My dad’s friend was a pharmacist. I went and stole some pills and overdosed myself. 

I dont accurately remember what happened after that. I just woke up with a burning stomach on the floor of my appartment. I was barely feeling my body. I knew that was it. Then I had some flashes. I lost my parents (who dint love me), my home, I was on the streets and I made it so far all by myself. I got through so much and now I finally gave up. That was when a voice inside me told “Now is not the time to give up. You have so much more to do”. I reached for my phone and called emergency. I dont remember what happened after that for two weeks. I was discharged a week after that. I came back to my appartment.

I learnt the most important thing that time. I am what I am and that is exactly what I need. I dont need to interesting or charming. I dont need friends or habbits that lets me make more friends. I set my goals that day. I worked really hard.

Today I am Solo game developer and I also own another business. I work and play games when I am not working. I still feel like a worthless shit when I am around people. But I avoid contact and plan to make a self sustaining life where I dont have to interact and depend on any human. 

I would really like someone to understand me and have a relationship but I dont care if that never happens. All I need is me. I know I made it this far in life and I know I can take it all the way. I may be worthless to her or other people but I am the best thing that ever happened to me. I am not going to change anything about my life and going to continue to live happily and savour my moments all by myself.

P.S. sorry for the long post and very sorry about my grammar. English is not my first language. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way. Have a nice day.",lonely,My lonely life...,2020-08-31 17:00:52

You may even find someone you really get along with and who knows.

37,matheusgrossi,1598845233,1,"Hi everyone, sorry for acting like a 20 year old boy again, but it has been 4 years since I met a very special girl for me;

I  was hanging out with some friends, and then I met this girl, a quiet  very shy girl, small, with a cute big noose (that she hated it, but it  is very cute), she was just listening to her extrovert friend, and then  suddenly I saw how beautiful she is;

I  tried to start a conversation with her, but she is very shy, and then  suddenly she started laughing about the way I drinked Coffee (BTW I love  it), and then she went to her home, without saying ""bye"" to anyone...

I  was intrigued, and then I went home, and her friends told me she's  worth it, after I said she is very VERY fricking beautiful, and we  started chatting... she was interested in me for a time, but we couldn't  see each other because of money and this kind of stuff;

But  then I discovered that she is a VERY smart girl! And then I started  looking her with other eyes... she is an awesome girl! Every effort to  get her to talk what's on her mind is completely worth it, even when she  is completely quiet, I know there is an universe going on in her head,  that I want discover;

I opened my  heart to her, but she doesn't have the same interests I have, such a  beautiful creature, such meaningful words, that cute noose... well turns  out she doesn't even want to speak with me anymore;

In  this meantime I tried to know other girls and hangout, but it didn't  work, they didn't wanted a relationship with me (which is their right to  decide of course, I'm NOT here to play the victim), but in all of this  time, I was thinking about her, causing me a weird feeling;

Well  life goes on... I'll get over it, I'll find another person, but I came  here to (vent) say all the things I wished to do for her, and say to  her...

I wish I could hug her very  close, feel her breath, I wish I could look in her eyes, and  contemplate every detail of her souls as I looked through those windows  (because the eyes are windows to someone else's soul and blablabla,  sorry for the drama), take out of her every smart thought, feel her  beautiful face, her cute noose, that she hates so much, and I like so  much, to give her affection, to say that tomorrow is another day and  everything will be fine, because she is capable, beautiful, intriguing  and smart and for being who she is, she deserves all the affection in  the world!",lonely,It has been 4 years and I still miss her...,2020-08-31 13:40:33

40,Davepicness,1598843811,1,"Before you read my venting you should read at least the beginning of the background. 

Like 2 or 3 years ago I broke my back. I was about 11 and I am a boy. It was a hairline fracture that went unnoticed for my 6 months until it was extremely painful to bend over or twist likely caused by me falling hard in a basketball game. After my back had been hurting for 2 weeks-ish my parents took me to a back doctor to get it checked out. He suggested I get an MRI. This is how we found out. It was during the summer, so I missed out on going to birthday parties and playing paintball with my friends for 3 months. 3 months of lying around and not exercising more or less at all. Finally we got another MRI (which btw is not fun — you get enough radiation from it that if you have any metal implants, they must be removed or they will get very hot. It takes about 45 minutes. If you have an itch, don’t itch it or they will restart because you moved. And low and behold after what felt like an hour of being in a test tube TURNED OUT THAT MY BACK HAD 2 FRACTURES. And was slipping out of place by a microscopic amount. The breaks were lumbar 5 and I was diagnosed with spondylitis (I think that was the name it my have been longer.)

So then I couldn’t do P.E or play with my friends or go to recess or play sports or sit without looking like I have a stick up my ass. But I could walk fine. So rumors (that were started by my own close friend) went around that my butt was messed up. “Ass disease.” “Broken ass.” I only told my closest friends about my back injury because it made me really depressed. So at least two were telling everyone they talked to. Bizarrely, I got ‘shunned’. Many of my friends just kinda stopped talking to me. Maybe because I didn’t see them at all that summer, maybe because they just changed, or maybe cause of the rumors. It really doesn’t matter why but it would’ve been nice to have just one person to talk to.

My back healed after over a year, which doctors said was a very unlikely. But I’d gained weight that I still carry (I’m not fat, but i am out of shape). And had been socially isolated. So yeah. 

Probably unrelated but still really annoying is that a few teachers just treated me differently. At P.E I was playing basketball when this kid (who didn’t know how to play so I’m not mad) cane from behind and reached and tore at the ball like crazy. If you don’t play basketball, that’s first off all dangerous and second illegal. But the gym teacher didn’t call it because he was Reffing 3 GAMES. I spun with the ball and the kid from behind fell over! And the teacher only then turned and saw him on the ground! AND EJECTED ME! And when I asked him what the fuck he was doing (obviously not in those words) he lost his shit at me! He actually screamed and got angrier than I have ever seen! And then everyone turned their heads and stopped playing. I was pretty much in shock at how mad he was. Then he asked me a question that I didn’t hear because I was zoning out. And when I didn’t answer he told me to follow him and he took mw into a room next to the gym and screamed more. I actually started crying and he kept screaming.

I ended up being forced to apologize TO THE COACH. Everyone saw me cry. And then I saw another coach yelling at my friend who was also crying. We didn’t say anything but we just sat next to eachother. I think I had a panic attack because it was really hard to control my breath for at least half an hour after.

Another teacher also reacted similarly when I talked without “raising my hand” (the teacher wasn’t asking a question, another kid was giving a presentation when suddenly he just obliterated someone who made fun of him. I forgot what the kid had said but all I said was “damn Bryan!”). People in my grade act differently towards me. Nobody ever talks to me unless I talk first. I very rarely/never get invited to anything that could be described as social. I have some friends but I am nobody’s best friend. Wtf happened to me.",lonely,Venting,2020-08-31 13:16:51

Sometimes I wonder if things would be different if I didn’t move from a part of my city that I have clearest earliest memory of. I had a few friends, even a best friend who had a crush on me (ha that’s rare now), and I didn’t get bullied too much, only from one kid but that was it. But then we had to move because my father failed to pay rent for months on end.

So then we move into a part of the city that wasn’t so nice, the only memories I really have was being raped by another damn child, ‘it was what friends do’ they said, so I just took it because I wanted to have a friend. They got me to do horrible things.

Fast forward a few years, we move AGAIN, no remaining contact from the friends of the first part of this telling, I don’t really remember much of that time, between 2006 and 2012. I had friends, but they were backstabbing, worked hard to humiliate me in school. Without friends again, hated by everyone.

I am at my wit's end with my life and don't see how I can dig myself out of the hole I'm in, short of an act of god.

I'm around 30, and every single person close to me that's around my age is getting married, pumping out kids, frothing at the mouth to sign a mortgage, and cement themselves in the rat race of life.

I know to not compare myself to others. I don't even want most of those things. What I do want is to not wake up every day alone and wait for more black clouds to gather in my life.

Previously, I was happy because I had a strong support system of friends and peers. I've struggled *hard* with depression since I can remember, but the older I get, the further people retreat away into their own bubbles, the weaker my support system gets, and I'm really struggling to find a point to be alive at all.

I'm not close with my family. I'm gay in the southern U.S., and see reminders every day that I'm considered subhuman. I can't imagine any work that I would actually enjoy, and that wouldn't make me want to blow my brains out.

Even if I found something to heathily occupy my mind and time with, I would just come home to the sound of silence. All of my old friends are time zones away and far too busy to worry about an old friend that's slipped through the cracks.

So about 5 years ago I moved into a new city while I was still in school. I had a tough time making friends because I have major social anxiety and the acne most definitely didn’t help. Back then I stupidly also broke of all contact to most of my hometown friends. I also didn’t have any contact to my best friend. Some time later she contacted me out of nowhere and it made me really happy. But our physical distance made it hard to stay in contact and we just had on and off phases. By the time I was in uni my loneliness weighed me down too much, especially because I wasn’t able to make friends there either and I drunkenly called her and let my heard out. She was on the phone until I was home and the next day I wasn’t able to call or write her anymore. Blocked me. This is maybe almost two years ago.
While I had chances at friendships I fucked everything up and now it’s been over a year since I was out with anyone.
Now I’m thinking about writing her something since she set a a new account on Facebook and see if she responds because I want to apologize but more importantly I need a friend. But of course I’m scared of what her response might be.

66,Tangerine_001,1598828495,1," Hi I'm new to reddit, never saw myself joining but I'm hurting so badly I'm kinda desperate. Tldr my life is a mess.

Background is that I was alone my entire life, technically had a prom date but i never considersd him my boyfriend and i wasnt interested in him as an SO. Cut to 23 and I still had no interest come from anyone so I was finally coming to terms with and accepting the fact that I would never be in a relationship.....and then a guy asked me out.

I was nervous but agreed and ended up falling completely head over heels in love with him. We were together for 1.5 years and he ended up breaking up with me for reasons that were entirely valid, although the way he went about it was pretty awful (over text instead of in person, for starters).

He wasnt perfect but i couldnt shake the feeling of right person, wrong time. We've remained friends but ive always had a bit of hope in the back of my mind that we could try again in the future.

Anyway I recently found out hes begun a new relationship with someone hes known far longer than me, a very close friend of his who I have no doubt will be a better match than I couldve ever hoped. I am happy for him but I cant deny the hurt I feel. Me and him even had a long discussion about it, he asked if we were on the same page of being mostly over it, and I told him that honestly I'll probably never be over it.

Anyway now I feel like I cant talk to him as much as we were, which means ive lost him as a close friend now too which is so much worse. My other best friend is moving three states away in a few weeks and everyone that ive been trying to talk to to make friends either ignores me or doesnt initiate conversation (even when I too have initiated).

Ive tried dating apps but i always panic and delete after a few days at most, idk why i cant stick with them but it feels weird and wrong and I cant do it. And then i feel bad because I know I'm kinda ghosting ppl. Its even harder trying to meet ppl in the middle of quarantine.

I'll be 26 soon and I know logically thats still young but I feel old, I feel like ive missed out on so much, I finally had something truly wonderful with my ex but I fucked up too many times and now thats a pipe dream. Not knowing when life will return to normal doesnt help either.

Idk what I want or need because I'm terrible a listening to advice, my best friend has told me several times to flirt with guys when we hang out but idk how to do it? Im not particularly attractive and I have the personality and social skills of a brick. Like I always want people to ask me questions but when they do I cant answer very well, for example.

Im just hurting a lot right now and i feel like all im doing is floating by, I always figured whenever my mom (my only family) passes away I would take my own life. For a while during my relationship that didnt feel like the case anymore, but now that I'm completely alone again that feeling has crept up. I dont see any point in staying around much longer.

I don’t leave the house or go on holiday because who would I go with. And to do what? I’m worried for myself. I know it can’t go on this way and one day I’ll snap.

I want to love and be loved. My dreams in life are to have a birthday party with friends and get a boyfriend.  Neither have ever happened (I’m ugly, cold and unlikeable, apparently). I think I don’t get given a fair chance because of my appearance. Knowing the rest of the world (the large majority) has had that normal life experience of losing their virginity early in life, having friends and partners etc, is very painful. Everyone is loved. It’s a vicious cycle because it just gets harder to get out of that situation the older you get (judgement, no experience etc), and no matter what people say it is a social handicap, so in a way I’m stuck in this situation for life it seems.

I’m love and touch starved. I have family members but we are on not on good terms and speak as little as possible. I’ve tried turning my life around but it’s hard to make friends when you’re 30, an introvert, and with a shit job. All friendships or attempts at friendship I’ve had in the past have ended with me feeling second best or left behind, forgotten, betrayed.

I have a friend called Tristan. We’ve been friends forever and I love him (no homo😂). It was about 3 years ago when he got a girlfriend. It kinda made me jealous cause I never had a girlfriend and I always bitched to him how lonely I was. Her name’s Kendra. I like her, she’s smart, good looking and a perfect match for Tristan so I see why they hit it off. We did group calls every night. The three of us: Tristan, Kendra and me. It was about 3 months later that Kendra asked if she could add a friend to a call that night. That’s when I met Lana.

Immediately I became fascinated by her. She was more beautiful than anyone I ever met and will probably ever meet and it wasn’t her looks necessarily that made her so beautiful. Her confidence and how she spoke really made me attracted to her. The nightly group calls went from being just a little fun thing to being the event of the day. Whenever we called I got giddy because I’d spend more time with Lana. I’m not a laughy person. I have a sense of humor but things rarely make me laugh out loud. Lana did. She was so hilarious and had exactly my type of humor. I really thought she was the one


One day I went on the group call and Kendra and Tristan were there but Kendra wasn’t. They asked me, almost as if they coordinated the question before coming on the call, if I liked Lana. I’m not one to be embarrassed about my feelings and I knew that if I told them I could trust them so I admitted my feelings. I said I was deeply in love and that’s was incredibly attracted to her. I never look on my screen when I’m on group calls. I just join and do something in the background like playing videogames or something so that explains why I didn’t look at my phone when it happened. It turns out they added Lana to the call right after the question and she joined right when I was talking about how amazing I thought she was and that I loved her. She heard all of it and when Tristan and Kendra started chuckling I knew something was off so I looked at my phone and there was Lana’s name on the group call. I thought she was shocked but surprisingly she responded back saying that she was into me too. I got chills when I heard that. It was the best day of my life and that feeling of pure happiness and exhilaration has never been topped to this day. We started chatting privately and we chatted about legit everything. We talked about life, death, love, sex, high school, movies, memes, videogames and even capitalism for goodness sake. We could talk about anything and have a blast doing so. We talked about 8 hours straight and eventually after 2 hours of saying goodnight, we went to sleep. I was so happy that I was with her. It was heaven. 

I woke up the next morning and got the text. This broke my heart into pieces and I still cry to this day thinking about it. She told me that she didn’t really like me back and that she did it because she was desperate and wanted to jump to the nearest person available. She said that she didn’t want to be with me and that she was sorry. I was an emotionless husk of a zombie for a month after that. 


Looking back on it, I shouldn’t have been a simp. I understand why she did it and I’ve gotten past it in my life. Or at least I try to. I’ve never had any luck with women. She was my only relationship and most likely my last one considering I’ve never had any luck with women beside her even thought she wasn’t into me. I am what one would consider a “classically handsome” person. Many people say that I’m technically good looking but none think I’m attractive. I don’t know why and I hope to know one day what’s wrong with me that I can’t get anyone. If there even is something wrong with me.




So anyway that’s my story🙂

78,noxmoony,1598822505,1,"Hi all,
I just wanted some advice regarding this issue I've been dealing with for a while now. 
My good friend of close to 9 years keeps ignoring my texts, leaving messages on read and also just doesn't reply for days on end. But she pops up randomly, as if almost expecting me to be instantly available to talk to (even though we live in different countries) and I have a different schedule from her at that. I'm always very aware of her timing but it feels like she has no regard for mine :c I've let her know about my general day-to-day schedule many times but it just seems to slip her mind.

More often than not she messages me or calls me up around the times I'm in the kitchen or sleeping or working and by the time I'm available to talk she's nowhere to be found. Now the normal thing to do would be to set up a time and talk then, but lately I'm noticing that whenever I agree on a time she just isn't available then. Last week she happened to be watching something with another friend of hers (even though we'd both agreed in advance) and another attempt also yielded similar results (never showed up).

The other thing that feels frustrating is the fact that she's always tweeting but just doesn't bother to reply to me or stick to any commitments she'd made. And the worst part is she keeps telling me how she really wants to talk to me but never seems to actually do anything to make it happen. 

She hasn't replied in days and when I went online today I saw that she was talking about spending the whole day with one of her besties watching stuff together. I'm not jealous, it's natural to have many other friends... But it just felt like a far cry from what our own friendship has become.

I just wonder if she's lost interest in being friends with me at this point. It feels like a one-man-show. I'm always doing my best to help her and make time for her despite my busy lifestyle, but it almost feels as if - if I'm not available at an instant then there's no use for me. And the cycle keeps repeating again and again.

Anyway... the title says it all. I (F26) know that I will be alone forever. I just can’t help but feel anxious about the future. I mean... I am fine with being alone now, but maybe years from now, I worry that I’d regret my decision. 

Don’t get me wrong. I have close friends and family, but I’ve decided that I will never be in a relationship. It’s mostly because of my parents’ marriage. They are good parents, just not good together. And I’ve decided that I would never let myself go through the kind of mess my parents made. 

I have siblings. All of them are married and I can say that it’s hardwork to keep a marriage alive. It’s a good thing they have good partners. Lucky them, I guess. I don’t think I’ll be lucky though. I’m not really an easy person to deal with. Don’t want to open myself up to someone and maybe in the future they would realize I’m just not worth it. 

So I have never been in a relationship or anything remotely close to one. Never been on a date or anything. 

And so far, I like it. I’m very independent. I can buy anything I want and travel other countries (pre-covid). But I’m now at the age where most of my friends are already getting married or having kids. And here I am just working or existing. Years from now, it won’t be easy to ask my friends to go hangout or something. So... yep. Just wanted to vent as I’ve never really told anyone the REAL reason why I’m not interested in getting involved with someone. All I’ve told my friends is being in a relationship is hardwork - never told them the messy stuff about my family. 

Anyway... if you got up to the end of my post, thanks for reading! And I sincerely wish you all the best.",lonely,I have already accepted that I will be alone forever,2020-08-31 02:50:57

105,chillbro888,1598803971,1,"I’ve always felt isolated growing up with no siblings or extended family my age to relate to. I was moved around school zones 3 times so I could never grow lasting friendships. By the time I started high school, people already had established friendship groups from earlier school life, and I felt so alone because I didn’t know anyone. I watched others interacting and was like “why can’t I have that”.
Especially with guy friends, like I never had that bro/mate type friendship with another guy. This effected me a lot because I felt like I couldn’t relate/belong with all the other guy. So I felt outcasted, and ended up maturing early and found talking to adults easier. (Actually better career wise).

Now I’m so used to being alone but it sucks sometimes and it hurts because I feel like I will never have a good true friendship where we talk, connect and do stuff together. I feel like I’ve missed the opportunity and it’s to late to have real friends. To be included, accepted and feel like I belong somewhere.

111,illustrioushalfwit,1598800454,1,"I've been chronically lonely my entire life, perceiving rejection left right and center, unlucky in love and feeling incredibly socially isolated despite a formidable social network and friendships closer and more intimate than many other people I've met.

It's absurd isn't it? Terrifying as well. No matter how many people I meet, no matter how many deep conversations I have, the overwhelming pit of despair grows, as I suspect that nothing will adequately satisfy my desire for social connection. It's fundamentally changing my personality, and my sensitive nature has spilled over into the realm of hypersensitivity, volatility and hyper vigilance in social situations.

I'm sensitive to a touch. I perceive every stranger as a threat and social situations as a land mine of potential rejection. I lash out and rage at others - intense anxieties that used to be completely internalized are rapidly becoming externalized and it horrifies me. Yet I'm exhausted. I loved being the empathetic, sensitive and creative boy I was - and I still am - but the sensitivity and vulnerabilities have turned into something monstrous, seemingly out of my control.

I long to love and have never dated, which is another source of rejection for me. But what can I truly offer anyone in this state? It is irresponsible to seek out someone as reprieve - I long to be an adequate partner as well. But let's face it, I cannot be with someone in this state. I've damaged myself beyond belief and my isolation has made me wholly unsuitable. The things I thought could be my panacea cannot save me now. I would simply be ill equipped and no one should have to deal with that.

I'm going to try to continue to put myself out there, to seek from the world what I desire and hopefully I can offer something in return. I am young, in my early 20s so it would be foolish to write myself off. Yet the sensitivity has become heightened to an uncomfortable degree. I cannot even walk down the street without feeling tense, unstable and constantly scanning my environment for perceived threats and signs of rejection. Shit, a stranger being rude to me is enough to trigger my low self esteem and intense feelings of inadequacy.

I wish you all the best. You are worthy and deserving of love, and enough. Please don't let your loneliness consume you. I know how difficult it is, but sometimes these things are out of our hands. Yes, we can often get in our own way, but be gentle with yourself. Love yourself, please. You deserve it. You are enough.

113,ZeroRei13,1598796397,1,"For a bit of context that will be important later on in this post, I have OCD which makes me keep repeating certain things when using my phone (amongst other things, but this is the one relevant to what I'm gonna write about). So as a result I've stopped using that phone and am using an older type phone to communicate with people. However, since I stopped using that one altogether, I no longer had my friends' phone numbers. 

I texted one of them from my mom's Messenger (she allowed me to, of course) and gave him my new number, and I told him to call me so I'll have his number as well. Yeah, this was in March and he still hasn't called.

Then I hung out with a friend (who mind you I hang out like once a month because he's eternally busy, except he's not busy to hang out with friends from *different ciities*, so ""I'm too busy *for you*"" would be a more accurate way for him to put it), whose number I had because we are in the same school so I gave him my new number there and he actually did call so I'd have his number. Anyway, so we hung out at the end of July or maybe early August, somewhere around then, and a friend of ours was in the area. Now I hadn't spoken with that girl since March when I stopped using my phone. So since she was close to where we were, we met up with her. I gave her my new phone number, and 
*SHE* said she'll call me the next day to hang out and play Yugioh. Next day rained and so she didn't call. Ok, fair enough, it rained, so even if she had called we wouldn't have been able to meet anyway. No problem there. Except this was in very early August (at the latest), and she *STILL* hasn't called.

Then there's this guy I was friends with up until 4 years ago. He contacted me after all this time, and it was him who said we should hang out. So we schedule for a Wednesday. The day comes and I ask him via text what time are we meeting at. He doesn't reply. The day ends and he doesn't reply. 6 days pass and he doesn't reply. I text him asking what happened, and he just said he was busy and also we can't meet for now because he's going on vacation. How freaking busy can you be that you can't text me ""Something came up.""?

There's also a girl who lives in a different city who never calls me first, it's always me. So I actually talked with her about this, she explained her situation, which is understandable enough, but I won't go into details here, and she said she'll be able to talk this Friday, and that she'll let me know via text. Yeah, it's Sunday and that didn't happen.

117,Witness037,1598793581,1,"Throughout my life, I've been constantly betrayed and abandoned by those who claim to be family or even know me better than I know myself.  There were periods whereas I blessed to have a group of friends who once appreciated me... only to be betrayed and rejected later on.  And its usually due to factors that are outside of my control.  Its an annoying theme in my life where I'm usually at the wrong place st the wrong time.
So i dedicated myself to work and focused on trying to do right by my parents.  My mother especially.
But with the current climate, I am failing.  Jobless, near being broke again and facing homelessness.  
Im such a huge dissappointment to myself and ive failed so many times in work, relationships and in life.  Im hitting a breaking point whereas i feel any effort i put in will in vain and I'll have to start all over again.  Im very tired of doing so as this will be the 5th major time that i would have to do so.
I've examined my situation many times and have tried to rationalize how I got to this point.  Most of the time I conclude that its lack of money.  Unable to finish a trade school/classes because i couldn't pay the rest of necessary fees.
Now, I've isolated myself from the world after the latest betrayal.  About 2 and a half years of self exile is starting to take it's toll on me... and my heart.  At first i tell myself that this is nothing new.  That I'm familiar with not being wanted for me, but for what I can provide others.  Treated like a tool.  
So yeah, i am extemely depressed...  but im not suicidal.  Those thoughts never cross my mind.  But i do sometimes think that life, my family or the world would be better off without me.
Ive never been in love.  My ideal of family or what ive known to grow up within one... the principles i once believed in were betrayed when my parents divorced.  I though grew last it but when my childhood memories reveals the truth to me.  It reminds of me a young boy being locked out of the house for hours.  Kicking the steel door repeatedly hoping that his deaf grandmother would hear it.  Realizing that my parents never knew how to talk to me.  Being punished and reprimanded for sharing my early goals because it doesnt fit well with theirs.
I'm constantly faced with hypocrisy and selfishness almost everywhere I go.  So that tells me that perhaps, im in the wrong enviroment but I cant leave because, no money.
*Epiphany*  the sad cycle of my life is this, any kind of attention i get, its usually for what i can provide.  I do so because its the only type i get. Then, i attempt to share a part of myself... only to be ridiculed and rejected.  Then going into a lonely journey to better myself and come back stronger and again, falling into the same cycle.  Wanting to get like a new perspective or start over anew but, no capital to work with.

Since junior high until the ripe old age of 22 I’ve been best friends with a group of 4 friends. We drifted the last few years and then when one of my friends dad died I wasn’t there for him, I should’ve been and it broke my heart. We were never emotional we were never close in that way so I didn’t know what I could’ve done. I regret more than anything not just being there for him. Not just worrying about how I might screw with his grieving processes. Just being there for him and his mom. The group was gravitating around him so since then I think he took it to heart and doesn’t want to be friends anymore. I’m happy to let them be since the drifting had been going on a while and it’d been fewer and farther between seeing them. 

I miss them all dearly and the way things were. I was blessed as all hell to have ever known those guys. But I know how life is supposed to be after a while the lack of exposure to each other doesn’t ever help over the years. 

I’m new to this. Being alone. I never put in the effort to get to know people and now I simply don’t know how to anymore. It’s second nature to the people around me but for me it’s just like a square box and a round hole. I wish I could reach out to people. There’s so many things I’d like to do. Mostly alcoholic things and maybe movies and hiking and camping and backyard fires. I want these things. For a long time I thought I wanted to be alone but I don’t. I want people in my life and to be there for people. I always thought it wasn’t worth the effort to meet people but I was dead wrong. There’s so much to life that gets better the more people that are in it.

I learned that people usually think that I am stuck up or that I don’t care about anything when i’m reality i’m simply just not outspoken. I have felt the true pain of loneliness but I have gotten to a point where I am completely happy being alone and that it’s not a bad thing. I have accepted more that I am more independent and that my preferences are not always like the typical extrovert. Anyways, last week I attended my first week at college and well, I made zero friends. I reached out to a few people on instagram but with the covid guidelines and all my classes being online, it was hard to make friends without having a genuine connection at first which is how i usually go about making friends. I decided to move back home and continue college online as there wasn’t a point of being on campus having all online courses. But it worries me that i felt like a complete outsider with no one to talk to there, and I felt like shit sometimes because everyone else seemed to have at least one friend. I feel like I didn’t do college right and that no one liked me. My social anxiety can get in the way of showing someone who i really am, but once I get comfortable with someone i am a complete extrovert. I’m tired of surface level friendships and usually I drop those relationships as I don’t see a point with being friends with someone you can’t genuinely talk to. From hs i made a few very amazing friends and i still hangout with them, but i feel as if i can’t do it in college.

The Inner Smile is considered by some teachers to be the foundational meditation of Taoism.

It is a profound way of centering by means of contemplating the separate systems of your body and the different emotions, and bringing them together into a whole.

The Inner Smile meditation brings healing attention to all parts of the inside of your body.

I hate that my happiness is pretty dependent on one person. Plus he started going away for work and I'm by myself for like two weeks at a time. It really sucks. 

I've never been good with people, especially friends who are girls. I feel like tend to see the worst in people and I hate this about myself. I am very empathic and I know when someone is lying / being fake. I'm good at reading people and it's been a while since I met someone and thought 'wow I really want to hang out with them'. 

I worry about one day getting married and my only bridesmaids being my sister and my cousin, no friends. 

I feel like I need someone other than my boyfriend who listens to me, supports me, etc. Last time I had a best friend, I was 12.

But with this quarantine, I've been forced to face reality. I have no friends. I've always had no friends. Just people who don't hate talking to me.

Needless to say, 2020 is a prime year for loneliness to set in. It's weird because there's technically people in my life but not anymore? Being physically separated from my friends in high school exposed that the majority of my ""friendships"" weren't actually real. Just the result of being forced into the same classes. I tried to reach out in summer and these friendships flopped. I thought whatever. High school is a thing of the past. I can meet new and better friends in college. But social gatherings weren't allowed on campus and we were soon sent home. 

I'm now in a weird limbo between old high school friends that either grew apart/are away at college/moved on, and the fantasy of making a new friend group at college - something that can't happen now. It's just me and my family now. I get grumpy as I realize that my only social life for who knows how long will be boring family events. 

In relation to the title, this loneliness comes in weird waves of content and sadness. Sometimes I'm glad the social pressures aren't there, that I can just focus on online work and myself. I have Internet friends and they're cool, even though they come and go based on when they're available and online. I'm able to remind myself that binge watching shows is a fine way to spend a weekend. That being alone isn't too terrible.

178,eeop,1598738816,1,"When I was like 12/13/14 years old I was just a normal kid. I had tons of friends, I could do all the stuff I loved at this time with them. Playing football. Biking. Swimming. Gaming. I was part of something. I also did things I deeply regret to a kid at this time. Basically bullied him. My friend group exluded him and we started making fun of him.

Then stuff happened in my life. My Parents divorced. An injury that prevented me doing stuff I loved for half a year. I started hiding from my friends. I got quieter and quieter everyday. Then I got put in a new class. I knew noone. I was the person getting bullied now. I dont even know why. Because I was quiet? I hid more and more, playing video games only. 

When I was like 20 I started playing soccer again. Maybe I could find some friends? The team was nice, they tried to involve me in stuff they did in their free time in the beginning. But I couldnt socialize. I never did things with them outside our soccer schedule. At some point they stopped asking me. Understandable I guess. But being asked to do things felt good and i missed it. 

Now I am 30 years old. I changed my work environment a few times. I feel happy at my current job. But I quit playing soccer. Not a single person inside the team outside my brother even asked me why i suddenly stopped. They probably didnt even realize Im not there anymore.
In the past years i started biking and swimming again. But im doing it alone now.
The time since my 30th birthday is tough. Im often getting very sad in the evenings and acutally start crying. I never had this before.

Always being in pursuit of something beyond my current means. Like being 4 levels below the equipment threshold for the legendary gear you need to beat the boss. You have different views, perspectives, maybe some innocent, some inexperienced, many naïve. 
 
But being deprived of an experience, a sensation. The chemicals released in one's brain when building a romantic interest, having sex, or cuddling, are completely foreign to yours. Maybe thats not the painful part, the painful part is literally the piercing pain in your chest when you realize so many others have this experience, except you. For some reason you are special, maybe its your looks. Maybe you lack a specific charisma in certain circumstances to make it happen. Maybe it was an act of God, fate just hasn't ruled in favor of you, if you believe in that. We can change, fortunately, since that is the advantage of being human. Change ourselves and focus on creating things, like our own happiness. But having had to experience this kind of pain, it seperates you from the rest.
 
No other love fills the gap. The platonic friendships have their uses. Caring, good people who cant entirely relate to your experience specifically. There is only so much they can do to help you in this regard. Families can vary, but mine is not very engaged personally and we are very withdrawn from one another. While you cannot argue that you are alone because there are those who say they care for you; there is a specific mindset involved when you are left out on something like romance, alone or not, it perpetuates sadness.
 
I by no means believe that one should idolize the golden goodie that is a ""relationship,"" for they will find disillusionment when it does eventually happen. However, I am proposing the idea that **those who are ""late bloomers"" have a different set of perspectives in regards to love.** A sincere, artless perspective that is buried in sadness sure, but is pure, innocent, and human. The game is to try to find patience, and to create your own happiness. I say it as if it is easy.

183,not_gorkys_beer,1598735377,1,"I moved into college about a week ago and I've never had a very easy socializing with new people and the fact that I'm in a single hasn't really helped my social life. That isn't really the issue though. Ever since Corona started I've only really talked to three people regularly (I'll call them J, K &amp;L), as well as a fourth person less regularly (let's call her C). Two of the three people I talked to regularly told me that the couldn't talk to me at all for awhile anymore. 

C and I haven't really talked to since July because I've had feelings for her for a really long time, and towards the end of the month I finally asked her out, but she said that while she really likes our friendship and wants to keep in touch in college, she didn't want to date me. After that happened J &amp; K told me I needed to give her space until we left for college and then later amended that by adding it also shouldn't be until I get plans to see a psychologist again. We continued snapping after she rejected me though we just didn't say anything to each other, which wasn't abnormal for us, we usually only talked over text. At first the snapping was a lot less frequent, but then it seemed to go back to our normal frequency after a couple weeks. That went out the window though when she moved into college though and now it's erratic. We did talk earlier this week when I called her to ask her if something I remembered happening when I was hanging out with her in the beginning of the summer actually happened or if I had hallucinated it, but she was in between classes so she didn't have much time to talk. All I want to do is talk to her, because he the sound of her voice is one of the most soothing things in existence, but even if I can only text her she's just so nice to talk to. I'm scared to try to talk to her though because I'm worried that I'll overwhelm her because she just started classes and I know she has anxiety. The last thing I want in the world is to cause her any anxiety.

K and I had talked almost everyday since late November and she acted as my main emotional support for a long time. That caused some problems though earlier this summer when I ended up overwhelming her quite a bit and she avoided making plans to meet with me in person for a month by claiming her schedule was too up in the air to make plans, but she continued to make plans with everyone but me. That was eventually resolved though and firmer boundaries were set between us. After that happened I tried a lot harder to avoid going to her with everything and started spreading things out between her, J &amp; L more. Despite all my efforts though, earlier this week she told me that whenever I tried to talk to her, even about non-emotionally charged things she would feel like she couldn't breathe and therefore, now I'm not allowed to talk to her about anything for the next 2 months. She was very upfront about all of this because one of my closest friends in middle school ghosted me out of no where when high school started and then was an asshole to me this past year (my senior year) and because of that I have abandonment issues. And while K was upfront about everything with me so I wouldn't think she's abandoning me, I don't believe her. Over the summer she said on multiple occasions that she only planned on keeping touch with one person from high school in college and that was her best friend. She never expressed any intention of keeping in touch with me.

Then, when I was telling L about how I'm not allowed to talk to K for the next two months, she informed me that I won't be able to talk to her for awhile either. This time it wasn't that I was constantly overwhelming her, although she did say that I can overwhelm her occasionally. No, the reason I can't talk to L for awhile is because she moved to Utah a couple weeks ago for her senior year of high school and she's been overwhelmed by that, so she's turned her cellular off for awhile. (She didn't specify how long though.) I feel like it's unlikely that we start talking again soon because I don't want to text her until I know she's not to overwhelmed with stuff to text, but she almost never texts me first.

Now, J, who's been my best friend since 5th grade, hasn't said anything implying that our friendship is gonna change in any major way anytime soon, but I feel like it's really only a matter of time. He just moved into the college he and I had always planned on attending together (before I got sick in high school and it became clear I wasn't gonna get in). But he doesn't have the same problem I do with getting myself to socialize, so I think it's really a matter of time before he make a whole new group of friends and all but drops me.",lonely,All of my friends leave,2020-08-30 07:09:37

For the last eight years (I'm 22M), I have lived with my dad, after my parent's divorce. Ive seen my mom plenty enough and have no problem with her level of attention. But I live with my dad and I hardly ever do anything or really even talk with him. He's literally working or sleeping all the time, and since the pandemic started and he started working from home, that has only become more apparent. You would think him working from home would have helped us spend more time together, but no. It just means that he's in his home office for longer each day, so it only made it worse. And when he does take time off, it isnt with me. He travels with his wife. 
I feel i never get attention or knowledge passed down to me from him because he is always so busy. And nowadays I feel that he just wants me to grow up and understand everything he does even though he never took the time to explain anything.
He was never a social man, but i feel like i still could have learned things from him had he only attempted. I try sometimes to talk to him, but its so damn hard to get him to stay still long enough. 
TLDR: Its good that my dad has a good job but he's sorta ignored me for a long time and I feel like I missed out on good time with him because he's always working.",lonely,My dad,2020-08-29 23:55:12

213,MoonDancer131,1598704562,1,"When I was three years old we moved out of my home city in the capital of the country, to one of the provinces that was significantly smaller. People in that province have a stigma against people from here, and I can't balme them, people from here are obnoxious and full of themselves. Regardless, it was only natural that when I started kindergarten my classmates would take notice of my accent and make fun of it, and when they realized I was born in the capital start bullying me cause hating people from there was just normal.

The natural transition to this is that I was bullied and alone from many years, until high school. One day I decided that I had enough and that I wanted to be part of the group, so I started playing pranks around the school. I blew up a toilet, stole the book that had all of our ""past crimes"" and burned it, and a lot of shit like that. Eventually, my classmates grew to respect me and we started hanging out and it was fun. 

Here is the thing about me though, the emotion that controls my life is shame. At that point in time I was really fat, I was a shut in that mostly played videogames, ate, and write short stories. So I had plenty of things to be ashamed of. 

That created a gap between me and my friends that I never knew how to close.  We where very different, and while they had bonds that where created years before of me being friends with them, I was starting from scratch. That was painful to me, craving to have deeper connections with them but not knowing how to do it and being too ashamed of doing anything about it.

Skip a few years and I'm back at my home city. I'm thin, even built some muscle, and I'm a grown up. For my birthday, my grandma and I took a cruise that lasted a week, and it was a great time. I partied every night and made friends in the cruise, it was great.

I made a new group of friends, had relations with girls, and started feeling like one of the popular kids. It was simply awesome.

But, when reality settled in, I had the same feeling of before. Me and those guys were just too different and I didn't knew how to deal with that, so eventually those relationships ended.

Now I'm 25 years old and got diagnosed with BPD, I also started getting therapy for my suicidal tendecies in a very prestigious and awesome facility, and I've come to learn a lot of me and my life. 

There's this idea that came to me during one of my sessions and that is that I always lived my life as if there was some kind of script. ""Be popular at school, have lots of friends, graduate at 17, go to college and graduate before 25, get a job and settle in."" Life was so hard and difficult cause I was failing at everything on that script, I wasn't living life propperly. Never got pass 2 years of any career in college cause I never had any vision of my future, all my romantic relationships failed, I don't have close bonds with anyone outside of my family, and I lie all the time to other people cause I am too ashamed of what I really am.

I've failed to live up to the script and society failed to live up to all the promises that made to me in the media. 

And that's ok, cause there is no script. 

Every life is different and just cause someone has it one way or has success in some other way, doesn't mean you and I have to live up to those expectations. Loniless is hard and it hurts, it makes you feel like you are withering away and no one is noticing. But there's also a lot to learn from it and about yourself.

In my case I am alone because I am ashamed. I don't wanna get hurt again. I don't wanna feel like I've felt during my formative years. 

But I also want something different for my life. I wanna have a job, and a girlfriend, and a group of friends and start living outside of my room, and outside of myself.

To live is to get hurt, regardless of anything. And we have to come to terms with that and with the fact that life isn't scripted. We aren't owed a group of friends or meaningfull relationships, we aren't owed not being alone. But we've also haven't done anything to earn our lonliness, we are living as best we can.

And if you read this, I want you to leave my post with something and that is this. Be kind and gentle with yourslef, you are doing the best you can even if you belive you are not. If you want to change start doing it little by little, and expect to be hurt in the process, but just accept it and keep going forward. You don't have to change now, and no one ever will do it from one day to another, just start with little things. Say hi to strangers, compliment people online without expecting a response, strike a nice conversation with a cashier while they bill you. Step by step, you can be on a path that will lead you to a life that you can be proud of.

As for me, I'm doing my best. My life haven't changed in any significant way, but now I'm taking little gambles at life and expecting nothing in return. Putting myself out there and letting me be judge by others, it's hard, but it isn't as painful as it used to be.",lonely,My struggle with lonliness and my response to it,2020-08-29 22:36:02
214,godslittlemistake,1598704200,1,"I'm fucking sick of life. I just want to get my thoughts out here.

I'm a useless person. I've contributed absolutely nothing to society and I've contributed nothing to anybody. I haven't made anybody happy, I haven't made anybody smile. People are disgusted walking past me on the street. I've stopped going outside because I don't want to ruin someone's day by having them see me.

My life is pointless. My days consist of this:

10:30 PM: Wake up

10:30-11:00 PM: Eat shitty junk food because my autistic body is stupid fucking particular about what it can eat.

11:00-12:00 PM: Waste time on Reddit. 

12:00-2:30 AM: Watch anime. 

2:30- 6:00 AM: Waste time playing games. 

6:00-8:00 AM: Lie in bed imaging that I have friends. 

8:00 to 10:30 PM: Sleep. 

I have no friends. That doesn't mean I have friends but I don't talk to them or that I only have 1 or 2. It means nobody cares about me. Not a single fucking person. I could get run over and the only person who would care would be the driver. 

As a kid I never had friends. I always spent my life living in my head. Reading books, writing stories, imaging things, etc. 

I hate everything about myself. I hate the person I am, the way I look, my race, my attributes, and my numerous flaws. Not a single person has been nice to me in years.

I'm just counting down the days until I kill myself. Became a game to me now. How many days can I last until I break down.

I vividly remember watching a video about D&amp;D and thinking about how cool it was. I thought it'd be amazing to play, at least until I realised I had nobody to play with. I heard about LFG groups but then I realised I was too afraid to interact with people. 

Doesn't help that my voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard. I can't pronounce an R sound. If u try to say ""I'm sorry"" it comes out as ""I'm solly"". Spanish classes were a fucking nightmare. Trying to trill my Rs and continually being laughed at. I can't pronounce ""TH"" either. If I try to say ""the"" it comes out as ""da"". So I have to say ""Ze"" instead which makes me sound retarded.

I hate my race. I don't feel like I belong here. I despise my family and I despise life. I hate their fucking culture. I wish I'd been born white so I could feel like I belonged in my own fucking country. Not some weird outsider.

I hate my life. I wish I'd never been born.

Why would God choose to make me this way? Why would God put me in a situation where I hate my fucking life and then force me to stay in the shit hole he created.",lonely,I just want to get my thoughts out.,2020-08-29 22:30:00

239,polodrit,1598676383,1,"I don’t get it

Every time I’m in a group of three or more people, I somehow lose all courage to talk to anyone because I feel like I would be interrupting. Getting introduced to people is great and all but when I’m in room full of people I know, it takes a full 3 months till I get 3 or a few more friends. I know I’m quite conserved and generally shy to gatherings, but I thought it shouldn’t be this hard.

Now that there’s a virus out there, a common thing I do is compare myself to my younger sister. As I’m bored as hell with myself and lurking on the internet, I always get saddened by the fact that the most fun interactions I’ve made with anyone is with only her friends. I always feel guilty about it and curse it at night about why I’m so shy to things. 

Another time today, there was this girl who seemed genuinely nice and we did some art together for class. But the moment another person joins and start getting really comfortable with the girl since they knew each other, I just felt cucked and became severely timid and just focused at the work at task. Yet again does it stress me that I always feel like im interrupting something.

One time I decided to text a girl I generally knew to be fun. I even joined her friend group, which was genuinely a nice low toxic group. It was all fun times until my sister started shipping me with her. I always shrugged it off but I guess she didn’t because she started to distance her self from me. The finally straw was when It was only me who had to start the conversations . It ended when I texted something and she never replied until a month later. I replied once and she just fully ghosts me. 

My final example where I really felt cucked, my one friend far away told me to join in for some Minecraft. The problem however, he had his friends from his highschool come in and join too. It was my first time calling a bunch of people at once and I felt really excited. That day was fine (didn’t talk much),BUt the next day, I join my friend’s Minecraft world again for some fun but my friend’s friend literally says this the moment I join. “&lt;friend’s name&gt;, nOt tHiS gUy aGaiN”

Hey!

I just wanna tell a ‘lil bit of my story 😆.
Remember when you were a kid,and you had things you want to accomplish,friendships you want to cherish,and even become the best at something?

Yeah...I actually tried to do that stupid stuff when I was younger hahaha.

So I wanted to be the best at something,atleast one thing...Well,I failed.

And what did it cost?

Almost everything...

I became an emotionless ***hole who didn’t care about what others think and feel about what I did.And slowly,as I didn’t realize what I was doing...

I...pushed them away without knowing,for I only wanted and saw what was good for me.
Yeah,I was a selfish guy who cares only for himself,but what would I have done back then when I was just young?

Now that I’m older,I know now what I have lost and cannot get back anymore

it terger I.

...oot struh enola gnieB

Damn,life really gets more than what it gives to you eh?

Well that’s what living in this world is,right?
Next time,I’ll be more careful in choosing what’s best for everyone.


Now that I’ve learned my lesson,I will slowly try to prevent what happened in the past.And think more about what other people emotions are...

I think a lot of people can relate to this but the lockdown has made me feel even lonelier than before. I'm a college student and going to class, seeing people even though I'm not close to them really helped making me feel a little less lonely but quarantine made me realise that I have no actual close friends, people I can call whenever, vent to or hang out with. I had a good group of friends in high school but I realised after graduation that I never really felt comfortable with them and tried to change my personality to ""fit in"". This is going to make me sounds like a loser but I've always been active in fandom spaces online (tumblr, twitter etc) and even though I don't like to admit it I feel like that didn't really help me make good irl friends. I do have a few internet friends and I love them dearly but they live on the other side of the planet and the time difference can be hard to deal with sometimes. I feel like I've always defined myself through my interests and I always try to change my personality depending on who I'm trying to be friends with (not in a two-faced mean way, I just want people to like me lol) and sometimes I'm not sure I know who I am, really ? idk if that makes sense I hope someone will relate to that so I feel less alone.

I'm also a hopeless romantic who has never been in a relationship (I'm 20) and at this point I'm not sure anyone would be attracted to me ? I'm very insecure, I just don't think I have anything to offer and I'm scared my ""lack of experience"" would make things awkward but I spend hours daydreaming about finding ""the one"" even though I know that's not possible. So, yeah I'm not sure where I'm going with this post but this loneliness is getting harder and harder to deal with, all I do is distract myself with movies and tv shows so I won't have to think about how alone I am..

I enjoyed most of my childhood but it was painfully lonely. Now, lets fast forward to 2015. I met my then partner in the fall and we ended up staying together for near enough 5 years. The relationship was brilliant, but it had a painfully toxic undertone that has had horrific repercussions. One of the main examples relates to my depression. In the early days of the relationship, my ex-partner slowly began to isolate me from the few people I associated with outside of education. Pretty much every aspect of my life was controlled by her and I completely let it happen because I loved her more than I loved myself. We would do everything together, and our previous friendship circle dissipated until it was just us left. Following this, I developed a pretty awful health condition that had me knocked down for a good while. I could barely leave the house and I struggled with a lot of different things. This sounds awful but during this period, I think she was the most content and happy. She never had to worry about any of the previously mentioned paranoia and I was permanently at home alone. Any suggestion relating to returning to education of looking for work when I recovered was simply dismissed and she often threatened to leave if I returned to university because she couldn’t cope with me being in that kind of environment. The only person outside of my household I came into contact with was her and this lasted for 1-1.5 years. I never had an issue with her being social, having friends or going out. However, I pretty much abstained from all of that because I couldn’t be trusted. Honestly, idk why I am writing this. I have been particularly lonely the past week. I am still struggling to make friends here in the UK and my depression has been acting up.

Many of the relationships broke when the reality comes and makes you realize that you aren't the better person, maybe you don't have psicologycal capacity to stand again it, maybe you aren't live alone and reach closer to her, maybe you can afford much things to do with her and I could talk more examples.

I went last year and didn’t enjoy it, I sat at my table alone while everyone else danced with their partners. Since of COVID, there’s no dancing this year so everyone will just sit at their tables for 3 hours, apparently there’s things to do that the seniors committee is planning but I feel like it would be boring for me. 
My reasons for not wanting to go is because I’m on the ‘outside’ of my friend group, I don’t get invited to things they have on the weekends/holidays. Same as last year, I don’t have a partner so I’d just be sitting there with people that don’t like me for 3 hours. My crush is also there as well, but she’s on another table with her friends and she doesn’t care about me either.
Then there’s the cost of going which is 80 dollars, and people have made plans to have after parties as where I live, bars and nightclub have opened again and I haven’t been invited to anything.
So yeah, either I go to the ball and probably be bored and sad for 3 hours or stay at home and do nothing as usual.

307,anxiouslyeverafter,1598595085,1,"I quit smoking, both cigarettes and vaping, and I quit caffeine. Really, those were the only addictions I had. It was also unbelievably easy for me to quit both at the same time. I've been depressed, lonely, and more for decades now, with the exception of 5 years ago when I was in a relationship with what I now believe might have been my soul mate.

The brief time we were together I was happy. No depression, no loneliness, no sadness, no lethargy, no hopelessness. I was happy, motivated, eager, and my cheerfulness was contagious. I was a little anxious, but I always have been.

She ended the relationship, with the ""it's not you, it's me speech"", and ceased all contact with me and my friends, so I have no idea what her real reason was. Nobody I have contact with does.

I realized that out of the few relationships I've had, and all the women I've ever been attracted to, she remains the only one to this day that I can still say with 100% confidence and certainty that I love.

Before a couple of months ago, I hadn't really thought much about her for a long time, having been focusing on distracting myself with work. I started thinking about her again when I started having ""dreammares"" (I'm not sure what else to call them, they're some of the best dreams I've ever had, but wake up, realize they were dreams, and breakdown because they aren't real. I absolutely hate them). In these dreams she and I are together and happy. Other details are varied, but those are consistent.

I thought that changing certain things about myself would help, but I only feel worse. Before I quit those habits, I never got hungry. I could go 3-4 days without eating because I'd forget. I'd only remember to eat when I had trouble thinking or talking. I hardly slept, getting 2-5 hours of sleep per night, generally closer to the smaller range. Now, I can eat until my stomach feels like it's going to explode and I still feel a strong hunger and desire to gorge. I'm also having trouble waking up with less than 10 hours of sleep.

I know a lot of people don't believe in soul mates. More agree that it's a bad idea to try and reconnect with exes. But what else can I do? My life feels to be getting worse the more I try to make it better. I need someone to help convince me that I have alternatives to doing so. Something more concrete than silly things like ""you'll find someone else"" or ""there's more fish in the sea"".

So I got dumped a few months ago -- late December to be exact. Shitty experience and all, but I'd say that I'm pretty over it now.

It just doesn't feel good when all you do is send memes to a group chat. Now, I find myself kind of in a weird spot. I don't really have any friends anymore, but I think I'd like to get back out there and find some. Some quality friends.

I feel like my life is actually pretty decent right now, definitely better than before, but I don't really have anyone else around me. I go to work, but don't talk to anyone there. I don't feel sad or depressed, but I fear that spending the next few years of my life alone (keep in mind, I'm 19) might not be the best thing for me.

I have been staying off social media because I know it will only make the isolation feel worse. In a way, it’s ironic to think that social media can have that effect. Whether I am at home, or the only person physically at work for months so that everyone else can stay home, isolation is always there.

Like you I feel lonely a lot of the time. I have a loving family, and certainly being with them is great, but I just feel like I have no good friends.

I am sick of being the one to initiate contact, so I've for the most part stopped with all but one or two people who actually put in effort. The first time I heard from people in a long time was recently when I had a new child. Very few questions, though. Mostly, ""Congratulations,"" and zero follow ups as of a month later.

The few friends I do have are good people, but they just won't give me what I need.

I want a friend who I can talk to or even just text a couple times a week, and where if we didn't hang out once a week it would be abnormal. We could talk about meaningful things, or just shallow things, I don't care. The biggest thing I miss about old friendships is that it was simply implied that we'd spend time together. Now they're just too lazy or don't care about me enough to put forward any effort.

These days I'll become upset just seeing people talking and laughing with each other. I can't help but feel extremely jealous. This isn't like me. I just feel like I've gotten so bitter.

I know it's not the right time to meet new people due to COVID, but in the future, is there a way to clearly communicate what I want with someone without them feeling like I'm placing expectations on them?

Alright. Yes, i'm a virgin if you had that question. But i don't think it's just about lust. It feels like i actually want someone to be right by me when i'm sleeping in my bed, someone to hug, exchange love with. Depending on where i'm from sex before marriage is kind of a taboo here. It's not illegal, as the age of consent is 16 like most countries. It's just that people think it's taboo. I've been that person that always looked down on others for feeling like a slave of somebody's love.

But now i'm desperate, i feel like i really need someone to love me, i'm a really obsessive person. For that reason for a long period of time i was pretty much always scared about these things. Because i never wanted to feel those feelings such as: rejection or heartbreak over someone cheating on me, or simply just leaving me and moving on.

These past days have been going pretty rough. I feel like a girlfriend would definitely heal me. Someone to care for and love deeply. Here i am all alone listening to doomer playlists on Youtube day and night, locked inside my house of because of quarantine. Shit's terrible i don't remember when i had a direct interaction with someone else other than my grandparents. My family is divorced so.

356,princesspootlovato,1598553023,1,"Quarantine started and everything was fine. I just got into a relationship and me and my friends were calling regularly. But then my friends started summer school and I tried not to bother them, so I didn’t ask to call because they seemed really busy and even if I wanted to call them they would just be working and I would feel restricted to just stay in front of my laptop doing nothing. 

So I’m guessing they called each other while they worked and in that way it strengthens their relationship- which is perfectly fine and makes sense that it would. Then they started to hang out together w/o me, which at first hurt of course, but after I realized that friendships are not monogamous and I have hung out with them individually too, so being jealous of them would be wrong on my part.

I think what just hurts is that I’m feeling really lonely and they don’t reach out. And when I do reach out, it seems like they are doing stuff together. 

I think another reason why we are distant atm is that they wanna get to know my bf more but I’m not one to really talk about him or like invite him to watch movies over ft or hangouts- we prefer to be alone since the relationship is new and we’re still very much mushy gushy with each other. He is more introverted than my friends so I feel like if he doesn’t say much they will assume that maybe he doesn’t like them, when it’s not the case. He has continuously told me that he would always be down to hangout with us and he knows how much they mean to me, but as of rn I don’t feel the urge to ask them to hangout with me and my bf especially if I’m not even hanging out with my friends myself. It will seem forced since I have brought up these feelings to them too. 

It has honestly affected my mental health a lot, which is weird to say bc I would presume myself to be a very loud and outgoing person. I guess as of rn, I’m trying to seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen myself as a person. I’m working on being alone and trying not to amount my happiness on other people’s company if that makes sense. But regardless of what I do, I’m always in and out with this feeling of sadness, boredom and loneliness. 

Sorry if this is really long, but I wanted to express my feelings somewhere.

361,AdventurousToday4239,1598549313,1,"This is kind of a long story so please bare with me. I had a friend that was quite a bit younger than me ( I am 50 and she is 35 ) and I obviously upset her.  She has completely ghosted me and even blocked me from being able to contact her on the phone. I am devastated because this was my only friend. I can't stop crying!!!! I am going to be honest and list off some of the good things and not so good things I did during our brief friendship. I really want brutally honest answers from everyone and tell me if my friend had a right to ghost me or if she overreacted. For reference we will call my friend Kelly.
So as I stated before, I am quite a bit older than Kelly. I live with my daughter, daughter's boyfriend ( who I can't stand) and two teenage grandchildren. I suffer from depression and anxiety and have a few other physical ailments that has left me on disability. I do make and sell crafts from my home and that is how I met Kelly about 2 years ago. Kelly is one nicest people I have ever met in my life. She is kind, patient, generous and helpful. We met during a particular low time in my life. I think she sensed I was lonely and depressed and offered her friendship to me. She even put me in touch with a ton of people that ended up buying my crafts which helped me tremendously since my income is limited. There were a lot of problems going on in my home with my daughter and her boyfriend that was causing my anxiety to skyrocket. Kelly and I would go have lunch together every couple of weeks and she would always lend me compassion and advice. This amount of time spent with her was fine with me in the beginning. Later on my feelings changed about this but I will get into why later.
A little bit more about her... Kelly is married and leaves for almost half of the year during the winter. When she was gone she would call me every couple of weeks and check in. When she returned home my daughter had finally sold our home and we got a new house 45 minutes away. Since Kelly's husband was leaving for a week for an out of state softball tournament I invited her to come stay the week so we could catch up and she could see my new home. The week she was there she was so nice. As I said before, I have some physical limitations so Kelly helped me unpack and decorate my room. She also did a bunch of laundry for me that had piled up. I really appreciated it. Unfortunately, it also made me feel more attached to her and I think this is where things started to go wrong.
Kelly and her husband travel a lot. They also own a cabin up in the mountains where there is no cell phone signal. I hate it when she goes there because I have no way to get hold of her. They spend many weekends there.  Anyways, shortly after her week long stay at my house she and her husband left for Texas to go visit family.  I will admit that her visiting with other people began to make me feel jealous. I think I even jokingly told her before she left that I was jealous that her family was getting to spend all of this time with her. When she got back from this trip I really wanted her to come over again and stay a few days. She agreed because her husband was going to he extremely busy that week so it worked out good. On the fourth day of this visit with Kelly my daughter and her boyfriend got into a drunken fight that upset me very much. I was crying and I think Kelly was feeling awkward and uncomfortable with everything happening at my house. Kelly told me that she really should get back home because her husband was expecting her and that he was going to make her a special dinner. I begged her to stay one more night because I was so upset. She reluctantly agreed because I was crying. She was the only friend I have and the person that makes me feel better. Now this is where things began to change. The next day on the way to taking her home I thanked her for staying an extra night and confided in her that I was suicidal before she came along. I told her she had saved my life. I also admitted to her that I sometimes wished ( as terrible as it was) that she and her husband would split up so she could date my son and we could be a real family. After I told her these things she suggested that maybe I get involved with some activities outside of the house and meet other people so I am not so emotionally dependant on her. She asked me if I ever considered therapy. I pretty much blew off her suggestion because her friendship was plenty for me. When I dropped her off at home that day she could see the tears in my eyes. I was very, very sad that she was leaving. A week went by after this visit and I asked when she would be coming to stay over again. She told me that she didn't know and that her husband was a little upset that she had stayed the extra day last time and bailed on their dinner plans. Apparently he hadn't gotten the message that she was staying an extra night. He had cooked dinner and waited for her to get home only to not have her arrive. Phone signal is bad at my house and messages don't always go through and it makes it hard to get hold of people sometimes. I told her that we had a landline now and to let her husband know. I even told her he was welcome to stay the night with her at my house. She told me her husband would most likely not want to stay over and it was too soon to come back over. She reminded that she has a husband that wants to sleep next to her. I pressed for a time that she thought she could come back and again she said she didn't know. Eventually, I noticed that her phone calls began to taper down and she wouldn't answer my text messages right away. When she did talk to me she was her regular friendly, nice self but I began to sense she was trying to create a little bit of distance in our friendship. My birthday came around and she did buy me this gorgeous, expensive stained glass lamp for my bedroom. It was so beautiful I cried. I told her I would just stare at it because it was so beautiful and it made me happy because it would make me think of her. I didn't tell her that I hated this distance she was creating. So a few weeks later coronavirus hit our state. Kelly ended up catching it and almost ended up in the hospital on oxygen. She was so out of breath she could barely finish a sentence. It was bad. Once she got better she told me that she and her husband were going to Michigan for a month to go see family. I really wanted to see her before she left so I invited her to stay over again. She told me she couldn't because part of the agreement with her family was if they were going to come and visit that she and her husband had to isolate for 2 weeks so they wouldn't run the risk of getting their family sick. I will admit I got a very snappy tone with her and argued that my family and I always wear a mask and gloves and that we are very careful. This was a blatant lie and I think she knew it. My daughter never wears a mask and had been letting friends come to our home. I momentarily forgot that Kelly knew this.  Kelly held her ground though and told me that she needed to honor her family's wishes and respect their health and safety first. She reminded me that there were 3 small children that they were visiting and that she would never forgive herself if she got any of them sick. Especially since she knew how miserable and dangerous coronavirus was. I told her I had bought her a bunch of presents and asked her if I could at least see her for a couple of minutes and drop them off but she said no. This really upset me but I didn't push it any further. So the day arrived for Kelly and her husband to leave for Michigan.  Kelly called me to say goodbye. She said they were going to be driving there in a couple of hours. Then some drama happened at my house that I really, really wanted to vent about so I called her and she didn't pick up. I must have called her back 15 times and still got no answer. I texted and still no response. So I got in my car and drove 45 minutes to her apartment and I saw that their car was still there. I even saw her step out onto porch. My heart felt like it had been stomped on. I must have just stayed there for 3 minutes and cried in her parking lot. Not only was she purposely ignoring my calls ,I thought she was lying about her trip so she would have an excuse to not call or come over. I found out much later after they returned  that she had NOT lied about the trip and that she and her husband had decided to leave a day later. Anyways when she got back from her trip I told her what happened and how I drove all the way to her house and cried in her parking lot for 30 minutes. I wanted her to feel guilty. Except I lied and told her the reason I drove all the way to her house was because I dropped off one of my daughter's friends that live in her same apartment complex.  I think she knew this was a lie. Then I kind of in round about way accused her of lying about her trip and asked her to send me pictures. I think this is one of the things that really upset her. I also hinted at having her give me her husband's cell phone number in case I couldn't get through to her on her phone but she changed the subject quickly. I hinted a couple of other times but she would never give me his number. I told her it was frustrating when I couldn't get in touch with her.   A few days later I asked if she could come stay at my house again but she said she was really busy helping her husband with some things and that they were going to be busy taking some mini vacations to the cabin. I told her I really wanted her to come over so she could get her gifts but this never ended up happening. I asked her when she thought she would be available and that I loved her and missed her so much. She said she wasn't sure. I told her I felt like our friendship was changing. She said that things were fine and she just had a lot on her plate. Then 5 days passed and I hadn't heard from her so I called her and she didn't answer. Then I texted her that I was worried because I couldn't get hold of her and that I hoped she wasn't laying in a hospital bed somewhere. A few hours later she called me back and assured me that she was fine and that she and her husband had just returned from their cabin. I told her that it worried me when I didn't hear from her. I felt that texting her and telling her that she was making me worried was the only way  to get her to call me back. Her phone calls had become fewer and fewer. I wasn't really worried that she was in the hospital but I WAS worried that she was intentionally putting space between us.  I know this was emotionally manipulating her but I felt desperate not to lose her friendship. This was my only friend and I didn't want to go back to being depressed and lonely. I asked her again if she could come stay over and she said she and her husband were leaving to celebrate their anniversary. This made me jealous once again but I didn't tell her that. I hope she didn't hear it in my tone. I asked her when they were getting back and she said probably no longer than 5 days but she wasn't for sure. She said there was no cell service where they were going and she would call me when she got back. Well on the tenth day I still hadn't heard from her so I texted again how worried I was. I got no reply. For the next 4 days I called every hour on the hour, sent text messages and left sobbing voicemails begging her to please call me and let me know she was ok. The phone kept going straight to voicemail. I drove all the way to her house for those 4 days as well but there was no answer at the door. I looked in her windows but couldn't see if anyone was home or not because of the blinds. I had my grandson write a letter about how worried I was and to please have Kelly or her husband call me. He left the letter on her door.  A few days later the note was still on her door so I figured out they were still gone on their trip and she hadn't gotten my phone messages because there was no cell service where they were at. Then I drove again to her house a few days later and my heart dropped. The note was gone and their car was there. But Kelly nor her husband ever called me. I tried calling her one last time but I was blocked. I was too ashamed and embarrassed to go to their door now. So my question to you readers is how bad do you think my behavior was and do you think it warrants being completely ghosted with no explanation from her? Don't you think she should have at least sat down with me and explained why she didn't want to be friends anymore? I wasn't a terrible friend to her. I always thought of her and bought her small gifts even when she insisted not to spend my money on her. I was always there to lend an ear for advice. I even picked her up and gave her a ride home when she was stuck in snowy, icy weather. I know I wasn't perfect but I would have done anything in the world for her. I loved her like another daughter. I feel like I will never be able to trust anybody else ever again. Am I the jerk or is she? I want brutal honesty!  Sock it to me please!!!!! Let me also add that I think I offended her by trying to stuff my religious beliefs down her throat. Kelly is an atheist. I told her if she didn't believe in the Lord that she wouldn't get into heaven. I also told her how the Bible condemned homosexuality. I think this upset her because her brother was gay and in the closet when he committed suicide 20 years ago. I know my behavior might have been a little bit much but I don't think it warrants just disappearing on a friend. I would never do that.",lonely,My Only Friend Ghosted Me!!!!,2020-08-28 03:28:33

So, as we all know, 2020 sucks. And in my country, the schools have been shut down from March and there's no date of when it opens. So, I haven't met any of my friends in like 6 months. For half of the year I've been sitting at my home with my parents, the days are all the same. And if I didn't maintain a diary, I would loose count of the days you know, the days just blend into each other. 

So, to counter my lack of friends irl, I played games. And I had made friends there. But we moved to a new place and it's local Wi-Fi (I don't have any other alternative) doesn't allow you to play games. You can't even play flash games. Nor can you use any vpn, says it's ban due to it being ""an autonomiser"". So,  there goes another thing which I did for fun. The only thing left was, you know, some 18 plus stuff. But the authority here keeps a record of all the websites I visit using their Wi-Fi. Hell, they keep a record of everything while I use their Wi-Fi, which means they'll have a record of this post as well. And they can disclose this info anytime they please! Literally, my personal browser history has no privacy at all. So, I've been kinda loosing it you know. Yesterday I was agitated for a very small reason, and I literally shouted at my parents (who are nothing but loving and caring) for the smallest of reasons. I've started to feel like I'm an liability to my parents you know. Like I'm just soaking up all their money. 

Yesterday I tried to end it by stopping by breathing when I was going to sleep. As you can see, I didn't go through with it. But I can't live like this any longer man. I just need some friends.

I just want to reach out to those like me. 
Who have met rock bottom and thought,
 'it can't get any worse than this' and then it does. 
I don't have any friends.
No girlfriend (no im not ugly lol)
 I just don't have the time for a relationship even though I really want one. 
I miss the affection and intimacy. 
Just being able to connect with someone on an entirely different level than everybody else.
I hate it when I want to talk to someone about a book I'm reading, or a new game that came out, or what's happening in the world news today, etc. 
And have no one to relate or conversate with. 

But you know what.. I reflect and look back on all the shit I've put myself through or that I've unknowingly been through, and am just grateful to be here.
Grateful to be alone in my bed, missing family, thinking about people I've cared for in the past and how it could've been different.
But I understand now that the universe truly does remove what is not good for you at certain moments in life. 
Sometimes life has a funny way of tearing things down just so you can rebuild. And I've seen proof of that, not only in my life but in others as well. Things change. 

I've found paradise in isolation.
Solitude is bliss?
When you've been alone, trying to make things work for this long by yourself. You learn that sometimes that the best company is just you an your thoughts. 
If you can't be alone with your thoughts then something is wrong. 
We have to embrace our void. 
Embrace your pain and hurt.
Embrace your confusion, because somewhere in the chaos is stillness. 
Is peace.
Is clarity.

It's up to you to listen to your soul speak in the silence. Sometimes when I'm alone and depressed I just want to cry and let it all out. I just can't explain it, I feel miserable. 
But then I get into music or listening to books om audible and realize, this time I have right now is for me. 
I escape.
I become immortal.
Free.

I let myself go and allow myself to move wherever I may. Just to forget the world.
It's crazy how you can be in one place yet feel so far away. Away from everything. 
Away from the noise.
Away from anxiety.

382,beardieu,1598511532,1,"For me, it’s a weird thing to say out loud: Feeling a little newfound loneliness. If I had to classify myself as something in these terms, I’d say I’m a more or less even mixture of introvert and extrovert. I work in a field that actively engages with people. I’m consistently in a team environment while in my work setting. Outside of work, I’m either with friends/coworkers or spending time alone with my pup. 

I say this is a newfound loneliness because I realized (as of a few hours ago) that it’s crept up on me. Despite being around so many people, many of whom I consider close friends, there’s still some kind of lingering void. Tonight I had a couple drinks with friends, we all went our separate ways, and then I returned home with a dead phone and the power completely out in my apartment. Thankfully it was just an outage, but all the same. As I was sitting on my couch, quietly and in complete darkness, my thoughts began rapidly going all sorts of directions. Initially I wondered if it was just the alcohol planting negativity in my mind, but then noted that I was fairly sober at that point. I reached for my phone and understood that it was the radio silence that allowed reality to hit home: There were no more distractions. I didn’t have company to keep me from feeling an emptiness. I also didn’t have my phone or something to stream on the television to convince me that I didn’t feel this way. It’s worth mentioning that I recently went through a break up as well. 

Being stuck with your thoughts is such a peculiar thing. “Stuck” with thoughts. It shouldn’t be that way. Hell, it shouldn’t even be worded that way, but here we are. 

I know this is something that may pass (and probably will pass) with time. It’s just such strange, unforgiving feeling. Being single again has also eliminated that consistent back and forth flow of conversation that I had become so accustomed to. I no longer have that steady stream of companionship. In fact, during my silent and dark couch session I finally admitted to myself that I only remained in that relationship for the companionship it offered as a means to avoid the void. 

I know this was a lot. I had the strongest urge to share. If you can relate then know you’re certainly not alone even if you feel that way. I know I can’t be the only one who’s had these sorts of realizations.",lonely,Newfound (acknowledged) loneliness.,2020-08-27 16:58:52

393,friedbeansandcheese,1598501653,1,"Monday night/ Tuesday morning I almost died. And I might sound a little dramatic, but in that moment I felt like it was my last moment. I had taken a whole punch bar, not because I wanted to die, mostly because I wanted to have a good time and I wanted to get as high as possible. I ended up tripping the hell out and no one came by my side to help me. I tried throwing it all up, but I haven’t been eating as much because I’m trying to get skinnier. I was choking on my own throw up and my anxiety wasn’t helping me either just making me panic so much worse. I felt helpless, I knew if I didn’t get help I probably was going to choke and die on my throw up and my mother would come home and find me dead in her bed. And now I wish that would’ve happened.

That being said, I'm in my twenties now and I'm kind of isolated. I feel like I always pick the wrong guys to like, even if I don't really ""pick"" them. Every single crushes I've had didn't reciprocate my feelings. While granted, the last time I had a crush was 5 years ago when I was still in high school, unattractive and extremely insecure and shy, it still stings to think about it when I do. It kind of made me scared of liking anyone again because I feel like they wouldn't take me seriously, or that I'd be deluding myself since no one ever reciprocated my feelings. 

I rarely ever leave the house and I work from home, so the last time I ever interacted with a guy in real life who's not a family member, was... well, back in high school. Which feels kind of crazy now that I'm typing it out?? I'm still working on my confidence. I have a history of getting bullied and other emotional abuse that I'm still healing from. I'm not worried about my personality, but I struggle with body issues. I avoid leaving the house as much as I can and if I do leave the house, I'm very likely to have a mental breakdown while preparing an outfit because I feel ugly and fat in all of them, it's really bad. I end just wearing all black and a big jacket that hides my body and call it a day. So while I love the idea of having a boyfriend, I don't want to do it when my body issues are that bad, I want to keep working on myself.

But in the meantime... As much as I love being alone and all, I'm still human and unfortunately, I can't stay alone all the time and just be fine. Even if I try to convince myself that I am, I'm often reminded that I've never even had a boyfriend. I wish I could experience falling in love with a man who loves me back for once, you know? I'm positive that it'll happen to me in time, and when I'll be ready for it.

I love movies, series, and would love to find the right person who will share romantic, loving moments with me, like cuddling and sleeping together (I mean lit sleep) or watching movies and series, I'm also really energetic and love to dance and would love someone to dance with even if it's not a real dance (goofy-fun dancing), go on walks, see the stars, go on road trips, fully respect each other, someone that understands and supports my wierd feelings, and the list goes on.

But even if it wasn't for COVID, I think I would have also not wanted to do anything on my birthday. It makes me kind of sad to be always there to surprise the people I love for their birthday, give them gifts and make their day special, but then on my birthday most people don't even send me a text or say happy bday on FB. Even if they are far away, I make sure I post something online to remind them how special they are, but no a single person tagged me on anything on my bday and maybe just a couple friends sent me a text a few days after saying oh I'm sorry I forgot, happy belated birthday. One of them in specific I just saw that posted a long story wishing another person happy birthday, and quite honestly this other person have done nothing to help this friend through very hard times like I have. I'm talking a place to live, a person to cry to, etc..... Year after year, I feel more like not celebrating my birthday at all. I remember, for my ex, I would rent a hotel room, or surprise him with balloons and gifts, and don't get me wrong, I actually didn't expect the same in return, i was just happy seeing him happy. But then for my birthday he'd say ""it's not that big of a deal, you'll feel the same after turning ## years"".

434,wakdonaIds,1598469938,1,"whats up guys?, I posted about three days ago maybe. My long distance gf broke up with me after 6 months, and thinking wisely, I have to thank her. 

These days I've been thinking and I realized that it was for the best, we weren't doing any good for each other, we loved each other a lot (or I'd like to think) and we gave each other good times and lots of caring, but we were also an excuse to escape from our problems. 

She had her stuff going on, I had mine too and we were putting the weight of our problems in each other. I wasn't strong enough to help her because I was broken myself, and I was just not helping. She said she needed time to work on her problems with her family, friends and therapist. Obviously I totally understood and supported her, it broke my heart seeing her with all that stuff going on. 

But then I started thinking, that I also needed to be better, I was and am hating myself, I'm not happy with anything I do. I do feel lonely, after all she was the only person that held on to me when I was at my worst times, she helped me get through everything. But now I have no excuse not to work on my problems, I have no one to hide from them, I've got to face them. I'm finally going to the therapist, to begin to put myself together again, I'll try again to accomplish my goals, I'll try meditating, which is something I learnt from her.

And if you think about it, nothing good was going to come out of this if we kept going. Now she can work on her stuff, I can work on mine, and if we ever get together again, we'll be more complete people, and if we don't, we ended in good terms and I keep the best memories from those months. 

I still cry every night and I everything makes me miss her, but I know that in the long run, it'll be for the best, I still love her and I wan't the best for her.

I've had a few serious relationships over the last 20 years or so, and they all go the same way. Each relationship progresses normally, for a time. Different amounts of time. Sometimes we are just friends, sometimes we are in a full relationship, considering kids and whatever, then it happens. They leave me because they have stronger feeling for my best friend. It happened again today. I have strong feelings for someone I've known for several years, and a couple weeks ago they met my friend, and today they confessed their feeling for him. 

This puts me in a difficult position, because I thought our friendship was special. Every morning I would wake up to a text from her, and she would often call me when she needed someone to talk to. It felt good. I was happy. But now I know she prefers my friend, what do I do? I can continue being in the friend zone, and take a back seat, while they do their thing, and just sit in second place to her, or I can tell her I'm upset, and need a break. I always choose the latter, as she has made her choice, and trying to hang on after a rejection seems pretty pathetic. I always break off contact with them, but the bad thing about doing is I loose a friend. I've lost several friends and partners this way, but I need to maintain some dignity. 

What's different about this time though, is I'm actually considering breaking off my friendship with my best friend, because it seems like this is the only way I will ever meet someone who won't leave me. I don't think that he has done anything wrong. Sometimes they form a relationship, which is fine, I wouldn't want to deny them happiness just because I've been rejected. That would be unfair, but I really can't think of another solution. It's got to the point now where I'm so lonely, that I'm willing to try anything, even throwing away my best friend, even if this does risk me becoming even more alone in the end. 

I'm not sure if anyone will read this far, and I'm not looking for any consolation, I just wanted to get this out of my system without making any stupid cry for help social media posts, because ultimately people's kind words mean nothing to me. They don't help me get out of this situation. I just wish I could figure out how to be happy like everyone else, because I know I'm gonna wake up tomorrow, and there won't be any good morning text message from her, which makes me sad.",lonely,"I just need to offload, hope this is okay here.",2020-08-27 03:54:42

&amp;#x200B;

So like I said, I'm in college and I'm lonely. I don't have any friends. No one in my classes, my roommates usually ignore me, nothing. A lot of the time I feel like literally no one gives a fuck. Which they probably don't because why would you give out the time and energy to care about someone you don't even know? 

Today in one of my ZOOM classes (cause mostly everything is online because of you know who) I found myself looking at the participants. Everyone has their camera off (except one guy but I can't see him because the instructor shares his screen the whole class) and most people respond to questions in the chat. 

In this class, although it's only been going on for a little over a week, I usually type out a quick ""thank you"" in the chat just before the meeting ends. A little pattern I found that happened pretty often was some other dude doing it at the exact same time I did every class. 

But this class was a bit different. The instructor struggles for the first few minutes every class to get everything set up, so I spent a little time looking at the participants/the people who were there. I noticed this guy wasn't there yet, and honestly? Made me a bit sad. I know, I know, it's college, people skip all the time, are late, whatever. Eventually, I saw him pop in later into the lecture and I couldn't help but smile a bit.

I know that the whole ""relationship"" (which isn't even a relationship) is entirely parasocial and that to people with healthy social lives, my story sounds pretty dumb. But afterward, I thought: ""I wonder if anyone else has ever seen me like that before. Has anyone ever seen me gone and think 'I wonder where she is', or 'I hope she's okay'?"" 

Maybe someone out there cares just a little bit and I don't know it. I know I do it with others. Usually, I'll never know. But just the thought that it really could be possible makes me feel just a little bit better.",lonely,"Maybe someone cares, but you just don't know",2020-08-27 01:47:49

We didn't love each on the surface, but deep down we cared a lot, I knew her four years ago and we've been together for a year. All I'm thinking is what if I was more good-looking? More charming? More seducing? Would she break up with me and think about how she is going to give other guys a chance? What's wrong with me? Things started to crumble between us when she broke up with the first time and I played smart to get her back, yet I was disappointed with her and very broken. I really want her, I'm drawn to her like a magnet and I can't imagine her lusting for other guys.

Hey y’all I’m looking to meet someone I can grow closer with over time. I find it hard to meet new people in person as I don’t leave the house much due to having pretty overwhelming amounts of anxiety. (I’m really selling myself here I know) I’d prefer if you had Snapchat so I know who I’d be talking to, but if you don’t then that’s  fine I guess. I’m very introverted, I like spending time with myself. I love to read, binge Netflix and listen to music at a volume that’d normally blow someone’s ear drums out, i’m pretty sure that I’ve lost a significant amount of hearing because of it lmao.

484,MsPixi,1598418997,1,"Dear future husband,

Today was an extremely hard day for me. You see, I can't say for certain whether I have already met you and you are my boyfriend, or you're still unknown to me, someone to meet down the line in the future. 

My boyfriend of 2 months went on vacation today with his best friend for 4 days. We spoke over the phone last night, he said he would miss me but that we weren't going to stay on the phone and fall asleep together. He hung up the phone on me stating that I haven't been light hearted enough and that he needs a break from me. That hurts my heart so badly because nobody is perfect and I work hard at my relationship with my boyfriend every day despite the struggles I am currently facing in life. This morning I texted him wishing him a good trip and told him I loved him and that I hope we're okay after last night's not good night. 

All he said is ""i love you too"", and hasn't texted me since. 

I can't tell you how hurtful it feels to have expressed to my boyfriend in the past that I don't like not knowing where we stand, especially if we are going several days without speaking. Even knowing that information about me, he still chose to leave me in the dark and have a ""healing vacation"", while I lay here and feel in so much pain. I feel like my feelings got disregarded and I do not feel cared for.

I don't have any friends. Not in any state or country to talk to. My closest family member is a 30+ hour car ride away or more. I don't have any money currently in the bank for food, and I've been using the credit card I just paid off just to feed myself. I feel very low and disappointed in myself.

I have tried to stay strong in all of this, and got out of an extremely abusive 3 year relationship in April. I have given my heart to men only to feel like I give it so easily, but if it is you that is in my life, of course I can trust you to protect my heart can't I?

All that I know is I need you now more than ever. I have been alone in abusive situations, and now just plain alone for years and years. I just want to feel safe and have you give me a great big hug and never let me go. I need you to tell me you'll always be there for me no matter what and prove that all of those years of me loving fiercely and putting my heart on the line weren't for nothing. 

I got out of the shower today about an hour ago and studied my face in the mirror. I have a fear that maybe  I've ruined my chances of ever meeting you and getting to be with you. I'm afraid that being too dependent and looking forward too much to a life with you will prevent it from even happening. It is a scary thought that maybe I will prevent us from meeting or working out. 

Do you ever feel like if you don't meet me soon that you'll burst? 

This pandemic has been so hard on me because I need a support system more now than ever after the abuse. I am still working on myself to be the best woman I can be by going to the gym, and taking hula dance classes and trying to be kind to myself and learn how to be more selfish and also more selfless all at the same time so that I'm ready for you. 

I need you and I'm wondering what you're doing and thinking right now. There is nothing that I need more right now than just a very long hug and to cry my eyes out with you. I'm sure you understand why, and I'll be there for you too in the same exact way if you need it. I promise I will love you with all of my being every day.

 About 3 years ago (January 1st of 2017 I think), the woman that I loved ended our 2 and a half year long relationship and needless to say, it destroyed me. I was an absolute wreck; not even having the energy to get out of bed some days. I was caught up in a ***deep*** depression that felt endless to me. I was dealing with that depression for roughly a year. 

 After that first year things seemed to be getting easier to handle but I was still heavily hung up on my ex. Everything I saw reminded of her and all of the good times we shared which sent me into a rollercoaster of emotions almost every day. It was really exhausting but at least I didn't feel completely destroyed anymore.

After that second year came to an end I knew I was getting better because there were some days I would wake up and not immediately think of my ex and how her absence made me sad. But it was still haunting me. I still missed her a lot but at that point it was pretty clear that I would never get her back. That thought was the biggest obstacle and made me sad very often during the 3rd year.

 Fast forward to today where I'm packing up my room because I'm moving to a new house and I find a huge box of memories from that relationship. At first I hesitate to even go through the box because I'm afraid it'll send me down the same path I was at at the beginning. I knew what kind of things were in there, love notes from her and little mementos from our travels etc. All stuff I hastily threw in there a few days after she broke up with me because even just the sight of those things made me break down and sent my spiraling into a depression.

 My initial plan with the box is to keep it closed and  just move it with my other stuff without going through it. I then changed my mind for some reason. So I open it up and read all of the notes and they make me smile a little but then I tear them all up and throw a lot of the stuff away in a large trash bag. Upon returning from the dumpster where I threw away the bag I feel surprised. I'm surprised because I remember how I felt at the beginning of all of this. Back then, I never would have thought I'd have the strength to let go of the memories of my ex so easily. 

 I guess right now I'm just feeling kind of proud of how much has changed with me in these 3 years. Admittedly, going throw the box made me a little nostalgic of the time I spent with her, but it's very mild, if that makes sense. 

 My biggest takeaway from all of this is that time was the only surefire way to recover from the heartbreak. I don't think my ex is someone I'll ever completely forget, but I think I learned a lot from my time with her and the following years I was dealing with losing her. And that makes me kinda thankful in a way.

497,meandmaria,1598412364,1,Hi so after years of doubt i have come to the realization that I'm lonely. I'm 19 years old and I'm a pilot who is in college. I know it sounds amazing for me to be flying at such a young age and don't get me wrong it is I love flying with all my heart. But I can't help but feel so alone when my mind is off flying an airplane. I guess I can start when my last gf left me which was about 8 months ago. She was alright but I got bullied for dating her and eventually we just went out separate ways. Ever since I have been slowly going down hill. I'm depressed a lot more and feel so so so so alone. I mean I'm so alone I got back on tinder for the 4th time. I can leave tinder for 4 months come back and not a single person will like me. It's not that what upsets me but the fact that even girls just give me nasty looks. Since covid has happened and everyone wears mask thankfully I haven't been able to see a girls expression of me but still I know what they think. Sometimes I just lay in my dorm alone and cry in my bed till I fall asleep. Of course tho I'm quite about it I can't have my roommates knowing that I'm lonely and sad all the time. And I know people have it worst thankfully my parents love me and talk to me but still it feels just sad. Other than my parents texting me for whatever it may be no one else does. It's to the point that if I get a notification about the weather and see a blue light in my phone blink I get excited. Doesn't help that I'm ugly and I mean ugly. I'm also super fat I'm 260lbs. I mean who gets like that in college. No girl wants someone like me I'm just an ugly slob that rolls around doing nothing. I try to keep my mind busy tho on school or cleaning my dorm but nothing ever helps. Tbh I feel like I'm going crazy I'm so sad and lonely that when I'm home I talk to my dog when I go to sleep to vent. ( idk what I'm venting it's not like I have drama lol). And most ashamed of it all I name and talk to my car. Not in front of people of course just only when I'm driving alone. I call her Maria she is a 2017 camaro. Ofc it's the v6 one ...which I get made fun of bc I didn't get the v8 one. But I think that's why I like her. Bc we are both neglected in some way. Now I find myself here on reddit alone in my dorm room sad. But at least I have Maria...a fucking car as my bsf.... (btw sorry if my grammar is bad I'm just bad at grammar pls forgive me) (also no I'm not seeing a therapist anymore I saw one like two years ago but not anymore),lonely,I'm alone,2020-08-26 13:26:04

499,mesmerizingaudio,1598412206,1,"There are apparently anxiety reducing audios for role-playing with a fictional boyfriend
These videos straddle the line between creepy and cute.Forget writing self-insert fanfics. The perfect boyfriend is out there, waiting for you in YouTube land.

Be gentle with yourself - https://youtu.be/wvYeyMRHB08

Coworkers to lovers - https://youtu.be/lmsoEpZjosk

Confused? Here’s the deal. While many listen to anxiety audios to relax or seek out that cool “shiver” that comes along with satisfying aural treats, as it turns out, many folks listen to these audios for entirely different reasons. Some of those include role-playing with a fictional boyfriend—not that there’s anything wrong with that

Thanks to some particularly velvet-tongued devils who appear to have studied the cheesiest romance novels, this kind of fake-boyfriend ASMR roleplay can be a little corny, and perhaps even creepy. Sure, it’s meant to be sweet and comforting, and even “spicy,” as many of the creators say, but it’s also a little weird.(Maybe it’s the male voice telling you how to feel?) It really depends on what you’re into; we’re not so sure about it just yet.

Folks have been stumbling onto this sub-genre of ASMR as of late, and they’re having trouble coming to terms with what’s out there, too. What do you lot think?",lonely,Has anyone ever heard of boyfriend roleplay audios?,2020-08-26 13:23:26

503,witchsbrew,1598409269,1,"Hey,

First, I want to admit I have flaws—I can be crass, offensive, too political (left), braggy, judgmental. I made way too many anti-Trump posts that I think just annoyed my friends and pissed some of my family off without really accomplishing anything. Second I love  my wife, love my daughter and have a good job, just stress about job stability in this economy so overall my life is good—I don’t lack for anything and my family is great. However, I’m not really a super social guy and never had tons of friends (seeming less by the year). I’ll be in a conversation with people and say “how are you and your wife or family” and people will kinda talk past me. Even when my daughter was born I noticed a huge difference in the response from my friends vs my wife’s friends who seems more genuinely interested and excited. Maybe that’s a sexist thing? 

Anyways, after having a kid I’ve had a lot of weird mental energy, some anxiety, some just thoughts and reflections I’d like to share them with. I have a brother who I am somewhat close with but not someone I talk to a lot. Used to go to therapy for work related stress a few years back but didn’t really accomplish much and felt like it was mostly a rip off, although I did like my therapist.

Being realistic, do I just focus on my career and family or do I put more effort into making friends? Kinda feels hard with COVID-19... not really depressed per se, but definitely just wish I had closer or more friends to bounce ideas off of and talk about stocks and baseball. I have a few coworkers that I talk to about stuff but we’re not really friends outside the office/Slack... 

What to do? Is this normal for 33? I feel like people see me as kind of an asshole who is overly political so they avoid me. So I regret that... but it’s hard for me to shut up sometimes even if I know arguing over it changes no one’s mind. I guess I’m increasingly over discussing politics openly except on forums like reddit, otherwise there is too high a social cost. Most people simply don’t care.

Beyond that, when I moved to college I didn’t keep in contact with my high school friends except maybe a few, same in college didn’t ever build a lasting network. 

So am I just an oddball loser? Sometimes the people who want to be friends with me are other lonely sort of losers, but then they just want to vent and talk about their problems. I just want to bounce ideas about stocks, work politics, baseball, etc

I fled the relationship and got my own place and live alone. I don’t have any family nearby , nor any friends as I put my heart into that relationship and got hurt day after day.

I go to the gym everyday to try to be active and be more mentally tough and work on me, which I did during the abusive relationship which actually gave me the strength to leave. I still go to the gym so that’s the one thing I. Still do that has to do with self care.

I met an amazing 25M and we started dating a little over a month ago, which we were hesitant on for a little while because I had just gotten out of a relationship- one that was abusive and that I put all of my energy and heart In to.

This relationship I’m in is long distance, so despite the relationship, I’m still all alone without friends or family to hang out with or talk to and the only talking avenue I have is with my boyfriend who I only hear his voice over the phone and we don’t plan on meeting up in person until next year. 

I am finding it impossible   to carry on. Everybody else that I know lives with people and my boyfriend has his siblings he lives with.
I crave physical touch and just being in the presence of someone who cares about me so badly and it’s not even possible . 
Not for at least a year at minimum. I don’t know how to carry on knowing how long ahead of me I have to go with just me and my own thoughts and feeling like a robot day in and day out that doesn’t get heard or looked after by anyone.

I have  one friend who is in same position but he's not really close to me, he  never ask how I'm doing, never invites me, never interested in me,  basically. That's really hurts me. He's still the only one person I talk  to. After some time I met new person online who turns out to be same.  I'm so tired of being interested in other people, always ask them about  stuff... I learn that people really like to talk about themselves and  never really care about you as long as you give them attention and bust  their ego. I just want to know how does it feel when someone genuinely  interested in me. Want me to be in their life. Someone who really cares  and not just use me for vent. I don't know how I can possibly meet such  people, I'm not really good at meet new people, I don't know where or  how. I'm scared of people to be honest. But I don't want to be a loner  forever.

532,Alpha9302,1598392498,1,"Hello everyone,

This is my first post.
My apologies for the long text.
Firstly, I hope you’re all coping with the loneliness🙏🏻
I need some support/advice.

For many years I’ve been feeling lonely.
Primary reason is I miss the intimacy from a relationship.
Not just sex. I have such a strong desire to have someone I can share my life with since I was 16, now 27 yo.
I recently discovered what has to be the core reason of my issues.
I grew up unsafe. Me having autism never got the mental support I needed from my father.
He always neglected and ignored my emotional needs and acted like the autistic part of me was bad and degraded it like there was something wrong with me.
He was verbally abusive too and had many aggressive outbursts so I never felt safe when with him as well.
So I start wearing a mask (not literally) because I saw that my father only accepted me when I hid my autistic side and when I had certain ‘successes’ in life.
Basically, I never learned to accept and truly be myself.
Also, my parents divorced when I was 4 yo.
The resulted in whenever in life I met nice girls, which happened a lot, I always left when they came too close.
Mostly, out of fear of rejection and disapproval.
So unfortunately, I missed out on a lot of experiences.
Nowadays, I’m constantly seeking validation from other people and whenever people are nice to me, I am astonished.
I am still not used to it because I was bullied a lot in my youth.
Having a constant feeling of not being good enough.

Right now, I am really struggling with the loneliness and hope I could get all your support on how to deal with this🙏🏻

The chilling wind is driving itself and when it touches the bare skin, a sudden tinge of current travels throughout the body. Wrapping myself in blanket.
Above, the vastness of sky, filled with clouds looking like unfathomable mountains and the infiniteness of ocean, moving like it wants to reach somewhere. It makes you feel really insignificant. I want to ride these clouds. Oh poor lucky me, this euphoria. I desperately want this moment to be never ending. The same feeling, when sitting in the blanket of dark at night in the intimacy of the ocean, the wave building, crashing and breaking the silence. Although broken things are painful, but this break in silence fills me with calm. It feels as though it wants to talk to you, drawing yourself in it.
Faraway, buildings are twinkling with lights as though stars decide to land on earth. The freshness in air, the air filled with heavy cold rains, announcing it's imminent arrival.
Somewhere, kal ho na ho, song is playing, which can't be more apt. And reading this beautiful book, the book thief, which had been a rollercoaster. Everything seems so in place and perfect.

538,justanormalhuman2016,1598390655,1,"I have mainly 3 hobbies, playing video games, working out and cooking.

Whenever I turn a game on, I cant play it. I just don't feel like it. In the back of my mind, I'm thinking "" your still a lonely loser, this is an escape "". I usally turn on Minecraft when I feel bad, I put on a podcast/documentary and then it's fun. But now I turn the game on and I turn it off few minutes later

Same thing with doom eternal, I usually replay the game over and over, now it's just feels like I'm doing something wrong, like a escape .

And I don't feel like working out that much. I like it but I'm starting to take more extra rest days. Maybe it's because school started and I'm busy in homeworks but still, I'm starting to see it as a choir instead of ""yeah I'm gonna get my muscle pumped and feel badass"". 

I get a confidence boost after workout, but it last like 1 hour . And when I'm working out Im always thinking ""you will always still be Skinny, your a weak lonely loser"".

Every thing I do feels meaningless. Even at school, I can't study / focus. I'm always thinking about how lonely I am. I used to be called the smart kid. I feel like a disappointment to mom and math teacher. I'm so dumb.  They think I'm smart because I have simple knowledge of many things, in reality im stupid. I can't think of things I feel like I know about. I have no actual knowledge about something, I'm so fucking surface level. 



Nothing I do makes me feel less lonely. Even when I'm making oatmeal, my favorite food. I feel like it's meaningless and I could just instead do nothing. It's always in my mind ""your lonely"". I hate this voice. I wish I could grab him and kill him . 

I tried to socialize last week but i made it awkward and people forgot about me. There is no point.

I keep telling myself ""you don't need other people, it's just your brain wanting dopamine"" and ""even if you make friends , they won't matter in 2 years, once school ends they will forget about you, so there is no point in trying to make friends"". I try to believe in this but the thoughts and voice is too strong. he is right, I'm a lonely loser. 

Even my escapes are starting to not work 😭 I used to love Minecraft and training, now I don't even play games and working out feels more like something I need to do rather than want to. The confidence boost is so short and doesn't help.

Ive been coping with loneliness by training and playing video games all day in the summer break, school ruined everything. I can't escape loneliness when im getting reminded by the fact everyone around me is in groups and are going outside while I isolate myself. I hate how this will be rest of my life. What's even the point in living if it will be like this ? I try to be optimistic but it's starting to feel fake.",lonely,Why am I losing interest in things ?,2020-08-26 07:24:15
539,doomtrooper34,1598389568,1,"  I have never posted here before, but after a sudden move for a job I finally realized how lonely I really am. I moved for a small short temp job in a house that was left to me by my grandmother, various family members have lived in in for a while. I am just the latest one, I’ve been refurbishing it off and on for years and now here I am. 

It was last night I realized that I really have been alone for a long time, I have no real friends to speak of, just passing acquaintances, no romantic relationships with anyone. I am just well with me, I though tI had friends at one point, but I just learned they were just using me an I was too foolish to realize it. Part of it I think is because of my Asperger syndrome, part of it trauma from just living life doing a dangerous job for a while.  I have never really gotten much help, what few doctors I saw wanted to pump me full of drugs that made me a zombie. 

I don’t know why I am writing this or even getting the courage up to post it, I don’t trust people these days why I tend to just keep people at arm’s length. I want to get closer to them but, too scared because of previous encounters in life to want to.  SO here I am spilling this all out on the internet for some to point and laugh others to comment on not really knowing why.

540,TheCamelHerder,1598389192,1,"Rhetorical question.

One thing I've found about communicating with people though, is if we're actively talking or doing something, our interaction is the primary focus for me, but the other person may be carrying on 2 other conversations or otherwise being preoccupied with something else. I get that this is probably just a millennial/zoomer thing (eg. using your phone while out to dinner with someone), but I can't help but to feel its super alienating. There's a bunch of different valid reasons why individuals choose to do this, but it's certainly disheartening when I'm looking for more of a human connection and my hopes and self-confidence always get blown away. With my wife, in our interactions, we've always been each other's sole focus, but maybe people don't look for that outside of romantic relationships.

I haven't hung out with too many people in life beyond my wife, though I've made a handful of new online-only friends over the past month on the different 'meet people' subreddits. While there's a multitude of factors at play here, but I think in part the coronavirus situation has caused me to be extroverted to probably an unhealthy amount (ie. become very depressed if I am alone). So, since I'm not really ""moderate"" an go all-in or all-out on things, I'm sort of defaulting to just going back to not relying on other people and trying to overcome loneliness by embracing it.

Partly a vent, partly looking to see if others are having the same issue. Not really looking for in-depth advice, per se, because these problems, which run deep, aren't gonna be cured from a single reddit comment - although I'm sure the intention is genuine.",lonely,Are you ever anyone's sole focus?,2020-08-26 06:59:52

546,JDRuzkin,1598382143,1,"I’ve been doing mostly good lately. I don’t post here often and every time I do I feel like I’ve deleted it eventually.


It’s my senior year of college and last semester I was really excited because I started getting a little happier, working on myself more, tried to get back into my hobbies and things I enjoy, therapy was working. I had plans to do cool stuff for the summer and I wanted senior year to be the time I finally got out of my bubble. I wanted to make more friends, I wanted to finally try and find someone to be with or at least mingle, but this virus stopped everything. I’m back in school (for now) but even at that I only go on campus two times, maybe three times a week, where we wear masks and socially distance and avoid people. Some people already know each other and are good friends, but I don’t have any of that. What little human interaction I get with others is hindered (rightfully so, I don’t want to get sick) but I feel helpless. 


I wanted to meet more people and spread out my social circle but it’s all shot. I’m quickly falling back into a pit where I hate myself, I can’t think of anything to do but stare blankly into my empty apartment. I’ve tried really hard to feel emotionally full with just myself, I got my own place, I try to focus on my studies, I’ve been trying to lose weight but that’s incredibly hard when you hardly have the drive to eat and breathe, more or less work out. I got two cats who I adore, and I love their company, but it’s hard not to be lonely when the only other 2 people you see are getting happily married and living their lives and don’t seem have time for you. Not that I expect them to drop themselves for me, but I’m just alone to my own devices so often it’s dreadful. 


I wish covid didn’t happen. I wish I wasn’t sitting in a pit of loneliness, wondering when my chance to get more friends or finally have a significant other is going to come. I stick to therapy and I try to keep a clean and healthy environment but it’s so hard. I’m so lonely and insecure and sad. I hardly have the energy for homework already and it’s only the second week of school. I’m distant from my parents because they don’t understand jack shit, so I can’t talk to them about anything. I don’t want to harass my friends about my emotions, because these feelings come so frequently and I don’t want to burden them, or cause them to feel obligated to be around me to stave my loneliness. 


I wish I could be happy with myself. I wish I could enjoy hobbies and focus on homework and finally get into fitness so I could look how I wanted. It’s not like its matters if I could or not anyway because social interaction is totally off the table right now! I can’t go to a gym or a bar or an art class to meet people and work on myself because of this damn virus!


I wish I wasn’t ugly and I wish I didn’t long for romance so much because at this rate I feel like everything in the world is stopping me from having it. I wish I could be okay with being alone for the rest of my life so I could stop being so depressive over never finding romance, and I wish I didn’t want more friends, but I do. I want to feel included and loved, but I’m never going to be a priority for anyone. I don’t fit in, and I fear I never will.

547,veosse,1598381602,1,"I have a strange question for you.
I've always felt lonely in my life, even when I was a kid, had a few friends but never felt really bound to them.
In the years things haven't changed, used to have a group of friends but never felt part of it, also had a couple of girlfriends, I have one right now and we are planning our wedding, but still I don't feel like I can totally be myself with her even if I know she loves me and I love her like nothing else in the world.
But that's not the point, I only wanted to explain the circumstances.
In the years I started to hate uneven numbers, basically for the fact that they're not multiple of 2 so one number will be alone, to the point that I couldn't stand, for example, the volume of the car radio on 7, it had to be 6 or 8.

550,francisco_DANKonia,1598380431,1,"I'm definitely lonely like most people here, but I have spent years learning persuasion and marketing o try and solve my issue. If I had one piece of advice that should help it would be this:

All people have a personal narrative in their head that you should try to fit into.

Some people might be trying to win at being smart, some might be trying to win at being social, some might be trying to win at business, some might be trying to win at being moral. As an engineer, I won't fit into many stories unless somebody wants to leverage my skills. I could either try to find somebody who needs this or change the game I am playing.

Now these stories that people pursue are mostly the result of media and circumstance. Usually somebody will be praised or criticized as a child and they will decide to either try to improve a strength or prove people wrong. This is where I'll try to tie in some marketing concepts. If you can create an avatar of your ideal customer  (or friend) and identify which movies or books or current social trends they pursue, you have your plan to find a friend or lover. Try to present yourself as an asset in their story.

I have had some major life changes recently that involved moving back to my home state of Oklahoma from Washington.

I really need some friends right now and I have been putting off this post for nearly a week because of the bad optics inherent of the title, but the worst that can happen is not making any friends.

I’m not necessarily looking for people who share my interests, I love to hear, or read, excited explanations of friends’ interests regardless of whether I share them; but I will still list some of my own in case someone here shares some of them with me. I am into Metal and Synthwave music as well as some popular artists outside those genres, horror movies, writing, reading when my mind will allow it, photography, walking and hiking, and games of all kinds, be they board, card, tabletop, or video. I love deep conversations about anything worthy of devoting time and thought to, and am pretty much available at all hours of any given day.

With all that said, I am liberal, black lives matter, women should have control of their own bodies, gender is not sex, and cop lives don’t exist. Obviously, I am not a Trump supporter. If any of these opinions bother you, I may not be the friend for you.

I am inferior, inferior to literally everyone, despite me having a bachelor's degree and starting a master degree in university.

I don’t believe my parents when they say they miss or love me. I want to go home but I don’t know if I’ll be truly welcomed. I was homeschooled by my father and he would beat the shit of me as a child and tell me what I was piece of shit that would never amount to anything. My father has a medical condition that cause him to lose his job and his medicine would cause extreme mood swings.

 When I was 14-16 I was forced to live with my grandparents to keep my dad from worsening his heath. I slept on there couch for two years down the street from my house that I was not welcomed too.

16-17 I was allowed to move back into my home to go to a brick and mortar school, thing still hadn’t improved instead now I would get into physical fights with my dad instead wich would end up him threatening to kill me or sending me back to my grandparents.

17-18 My grandparents no longer let me live with them so I instead live out of my car for months at a time in a Walmart parking lot. My mother told me that since she was going to be with my dad for the rest of their lives she would be choosing him

18-21 I have gotten a decent job and am attending online college and live a bit away from home, I don’t know how to make friends as I never had the opportunity to grow up with any, the friends I think I have I don’t know how to trust. I don’t know how to meet or talk to women. People talk down to me because my age, most of my coworkers in my line of work are a good 5-10 years older than me which makes it ever harder to find friends or women my age

I can’t think anymore it’s been months since I last fallen asleep without asking myself why I’m still alive. I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to be alive anymore, I just want to stop existing. Every night I lay down to sleep I just think of all the ways I could end it. I have no one that contacts me first, no one texts with me texting first, no one calls, no one knocks.

I was talking to this girl for a while and she knew I liked her and didn’t seem to care. One night we got to talking like we usually did and the conversation got on dating. She talked to me about how she was scared that she wouldn’t find love and I explained how she made me feel. Maybe I’m a dumb Junior in high school but what I said was that if that person makes you happy and you get a “different” feeling from them, then maybe you like them. She excitedly exclaimed that she might like me and I got really happy. Neither of us have ever dated anyone and she was worried about that and I reassured her that it was OK and I would be there with her to figure it out together. I also told her she had full control over what happened, I wanted her to be happy after all. We said goodnight and the next morning I woke up to a text saying that her mom said we could hang out and every thing seemed fine. The funny thing was I though I woke up for a dream, I literally woke up, frowned, and then when I saw the texts I smiled and laid back down after responding. And then... she changed her mind... I was told that she wasn’t ready and that she tricked herself into liking me. Past couple of years I’ve been scared to take chances with not only people but just general things because it seems that every time something goes good for me that big bad moment is right around the corner. I’m not sure if I’m depressed but I have had this feeling of unshakable loneliness in my heart and I need someone to be there for me sometimes but if there’s not I just get bad thoughts that rush through my mind. Anyways, I started complimenting her to make her feel good and it didn’t seem to bother her but all of sudden she tells me it does and that I need to think about other things. After that she ignored me for a couple of days, things are better-ish. I think it’s important to mention we’ve only hung out once but we had plans to a couple times but always had to cancel for one reason or another. On top of that I might be moving into a new house that goes to her high school and all I am to her is an online friend now. The one person I cared most for now doesn’t even answer my texts and all I am is just another random online friend... even after all that time we spent laughing and being happy together.

619,HelpfulRecognition8,1598300130,1," all roads lead to a rejection

I’m going to unload a lot of mental baggage from years of trauma here, so I’ll put a tl;dr: I’m a  who’s never really had any friends and due to past trauma related to bullying from cool people can’t stop hating people who do. 

When I was a toddler, I was well liked, if my memory serves me correctly. At a very young age, I moved and attended a new school full of rich, preppy kids (yes, kids can be preppy assholes even when they’re in elementary school). The kids already had their groups of friends established, and despite my best attempts I couldn’t nose my way into any of them. I thought “shit, doesn’t matter, they’ll grow up and accept me”. Didn’t happen. As the years passed on I grew more and more isolated, drawing into myself and barely talking to anyone for (legitimate) fear of rejection and ridicule. 

I should note one thing though. I did have a “friend group”. It’s crucial to differentiate between these 2 people and real friends: these two girls and I didn’t honestly have anything in common and didn’t really like hanging out with each other (we only walked down the hall together, never made plans). We weren’t close knit, we didn’t party, etc. They were basically just the only people who were nice to me. 

Throughout middle school I was bullied to hell and back. I was a bit fat and I hadn’t really grown into my looks yet, so I got called ugly/fat to no end. If that happened today I would give the cunt who said that a right cross and call it a day (or at least talk shit right back), but back then I would hear that shit and just take it lying down. The worst part wasn’t the bullying though-it was the isolation. I’ve had people come to me on Snapchat years after the fact who weren’t directly involved and tell me that the instigators told them not to befriend me for fear of social retribution. I was totally alone. I couldn’t talk to the acquaintances I had. I tried, but they didn’t seem to care. 

Back then I was one weirdo. The isolation kept me out of the loop and I always would catch onto trends late, I would talk weird, act weird... I was pretty cringe. I wasn’t deserving of what happened to me, but I was still cringe. I think that honestly might have been what was the nail in the friendship coffin for me. The kids who weren’t bullies/influenced by bullies got a load of me and said no thanks.

Since then I’ve done a 180. I’m chill as fuck now and I’ve learned how to conduct myself like a normal human being. I’m nice to people, but not overly clingy. I don’t dress like a dirty slob anymore. I’m friend material. But... still no one wants to be my friend.

I have a boyfriend. We’re long distance but we make it work. He’s fucking awesome, we are like clones of each other and we love each other very much. He’s a partier though. And that hurts. I look at him and think “if he’s so similar to me why can’t I have that”? And it’s not like I can party with him, because of the distance.

I just... I’m at a loss. Why am I so lonely?",lonely,16f all roads lead to rejection,2020-08-25 06:15:30
620,AGodThatCanDance,1598299849,1,"I'm at this age of 34. I think this is the earliest memory of remembering my dad's age. I always seen him as someone who has things under his control. He knew how to maintain friendships from his college times. I always imagined one day I will be a grown up like him. I'm now that old, but not that grown. I'm not sure, if the people in my life can be considered as friends. I feel like despite having a decent job, I haven't accomplished anything. When they talk I can see how childish I seem in front of them. They all seem so normal, on the normal track of life, acting like grownups. And here I'm still not used to the fact that every day I'm getting older, but not growing up.

I try to meet strangers in the hope that maybe I can be honest with them, but they all seem so normal-ish. I don't have those grown-up experiences. Anything I say to pretend, well just seems so fake. I am not that interesting of a person, or just so childish. I understand I can't let a absence of humans invalidate my existence, and I'm trying hard to not think that. I have been practicing Stoicism for few months now, and it's brought me peace. I have began to accept the fact that it is not in my control if I will ever meet such a person outside the mirror, yet sometimes this feeling just creeps up on the wall of rationality that I built, and breaks it, like a periodic event. How can I let that last shred of hope be burnt that makes me think I might have a friend.

Yet, I am thankful that I am still able to survive in such hard times, maybe it's a deal with the devil that I made.

Then I saw her post some weird shit on Facebook so I reached out. Nobody ever responds to such things. But she did. And then, within an hour, we we're hanging out. She needed a friend and I was there for it. I had no attraction to her. She was just some chick. We spent the entire day together. It was so easy, so natural. The next day, she sent a message saying she wished I was available. I woke up to that, and responded. We spent the day together, and it was even better than the first time. That day, I knew I was doomed. I knew I could love her. I didn't want to. But it was coming. The next few weeks were very much the same. We spent entire days together, just... Talking. Just being. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever experienced. She went on vacation out of state for two weeks. I knew it was coming, but I didn't know how much it would ache. And I didn't know that I was going to break. I had a mental breakdown while she was away. Not because of her, it's unrelated. But she saved me. It wasn't just a simple mental breakdown. It was a complete mental, physical, emotional and spiritual destruction. For a time, I literally went insane. I lost my mind. I almost lost... Me. But I saw it coming. I knew I needed something real, something true, to connect with in order to come back. All I had was her. Not my love for her, but her. As a person. She is the most real thing I've ever encountered. So I did what I thought was right. I told her that I was falling in love with her. It was for my sanity that I did this. And it worked. Because I felt so strongly about her, because she was so real, I was able to come back. When she came back to town, we talked. I told her everything I could bear to say about my breakdown. And on that day, we promised that the first Friday of every month, we would have a day to just hang out and be free. She's in school, and working, and trying to buy a house... She's so fucking driven it's crazy. And I want to support her in all of this. I know she's busy. I know she doesn't have time for me, not like before. But ever since the day I told her everything, she's been pushing me away. Two Fridays from now, we are supposed to have our day. I bought a waffle maker, because breakfast is the best meal and waffles have flavor cups built in. Don't ask, it's an entire thing. Anyway. It's coming.

643,talktous_welisten,1598273626,1,"Join an intimate online group where this time, we share stories of fun and laughter!

&amp;#x200B;

The current times have been a bit gloomy, and well, we could pop a champagne together to make the mood a bit lighter but let's start with a bit of laughter.

&amp;#x200B;

Our memories are kindled with incidents which made us laugh. Whether seeing a classmate slip over water and fall into the puddle or a cat screaming at the sight of cucumber. They brought us smiles.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's share them!

&amp;#x200B;

What is Talk To Us?

&amp;#x200B;

Just because you are surrounded by friends and family doesn’t mean you are being listened to.

Speaking about one’s raw and honest truth is tough, and sometimes we hold back because of fear of judgement or fear of hurting our loved ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

Corona has impacted our lives so much past few months, and hasn’t made it easier for us to find that mental space we need to navigate our complex emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what “Talk To Us, We Listen” is all about!

We want to be a safe space where participants can share their thoughts, an uplifting moment, a worrying thought without any judgement or preaching from the other side. We are listening, so talk to us. We are your tribe, sharing everyone’s highs and lows.

&amp;#x200B;

Who are we?

We are an eclectic team with diverse backgrounds (film making, advertising, angel investing, behavioral scientist, business consulting, poet, business school dean, entrepreneurs, academicians, psychologists, engineers, design thinkers) with the purpose of nurturing safe spaces where people can express without judgement.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Join and share and hear, in our zoom call this Saturday the 29th of August. 

&amp;#x200B;

Register for FREE. 

&amp;#x200B;

The room is capped to max 20 participants and it is first come, first serve.

As of right now, it's really late and I should be sleeping.

In general I've been feeling pretty depressed, mostly from not having genuine people to relate to in my life or talk to and not knowing people who have the same interests as me. The lack of real true friends sucks.

I'm having a ton of other problems in my life, but at least when you have real relationships in your life, it eases the other problems of the world. I have ""friends"" but not the kind who ever reach out or want to show interest or care.

I could go into specifics about the other problems and things, I could say so much more, but reading through the posts on here helped me feel not so alone... So at this time, I no longer need to.

I think I'll post another time in more detail and also when I'm not supposed to be sleeping! but for now, just knowing how many of us are going through similar things helps in a small way. It helps just enough. For now.

My poor old heart is struggling, 
She’s tired and she’s weary. 
She’s broken and she’s bandaged
And she’s sniffling and teary. 

She clings to hope like a life raft, 
But time and time again. 
Her hope, it leaves her shattered, 
Abused and in torturous pain. 

And every time, she gets back up, 
And doggedly goes on. 
Yet she’s haemorrhaging faith like a fountain, 
Her will, fading as it’s dragged along. 

Man after man leaves her bleeding, 
Most have inflicted new wounds. 
The scars burn in her chest like a furnace, 
Her hurt roars in her ears with a boom. 

She can’t go on much longer, 
Bearing this weight like a scale. 
Life, piling it high with emotion, 
It would seem she’s doomed to fail. 

Her hope has cost her her happy, 
Too many times she’s been lost. 
She wants nothing but love and affection, 
But the price is just too great a cost. 

So she sits in her chest and she’s weeping, 
For the woman she so wants to be. 
But for now she’s building walls of protection, 
To house her sweet melancholy.",lonely,Her Broken Heart,2020-08-24 13:44:34

 I pretty much self medicated my depression when the medication they gave me didn't help and I tried a few different kinds. I met a girl (ill call her p) and she was wonderful I really thought the problem was solved. I didn't feel lonely anymore.

She cheated on me which has happened before but with P It really hit me hard and I didn't want to live anymore and I was scared to kill myself so I just used more drugs hoping it would do the job some day.

About a year ago I was hospitalised with psychosis due to drug abuse and had to move back home, I was so ashamed of myself for letting it get so bad and for disappointing family. So I made a promise to myself to stop drugs completely.

I wasn't allowed to leave the house for 3 or 4 months and I spent much of my time writing and playing xbox alone and for once I was actually comfortable being alone. Then P messaged me saying that she had been hospitalised because of a disease she didn't know she had. 

We started talking again and got back together. I love this girl more than anything in the world and I'd give anything to make her happy even if it made me sad and things were great I could go out again and see old friends and I stayed sober but it took me awhile to get use to being around people again. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get a job because by the time I was better covid happened. 

Lately she's felt different to be around and I don't seem to really matter to her anymore, I don't really feel like I matter to anyone I'm just a background character in my own life and relationship. I spend most of my time alone and I just want someone, anyone who understands me as a person. when I talk  to people it's like they only talk back because it's polite. 

I feel so lonely it's like I'm being crushed by it and I can't breathe but I don't know how to fix it, if I tell anyone they'll just say it's my fault and maybe it is.

So can anyone tell me what's the opposite of lonely and how can I feel it?

But I'm starting to realize that something a good friend of mine told me a few years ago might actually be 100% true. ""Nice guys finish last, assholes finish first.""

Everyone that knows me knows that I'm a pretty timid guy. Naturally introverted. Very small group of friends. I have to really push myself to be outgoing when I'm around new people. All that being said, it's pretty difficult to let anyone close to me. But when I do, it's fairly easy for me to get attached. This usually ends with me having my heart shattered. I've found myself in this pattern of falling for women who are absolutely ruthless. Only after money or sex. No desire for a real relationship. This is bothering me the older I get because like everyone else, I had this idea of how my life was supposed to look. I'm 27. I expected to have a wife, kids, a house, and a career. So far, all I have is the career and even that has been put on hold due to COVID-19 and it's in the concert entertainment industry so who knows when we'll ever get back to work. This pandemic has seemed to only magnify the feelings I'm struggling with. I'm not sure what to do anymore. The loneliness is eating away at me. Going out in public isn't a safe option right now. Dating sites are useless because I never match with anyone. And to make matters worse, my father who has NEVER brought up the subject of my personal life has started making statements like ""aight son! I'm in my mid 50's now. Bout time for me to have some grandkids!"" Hearing that makes me both anxious, and painfully depressed all at the same time. I've never felt such pressure before until he said that.

I know people always call bullshit when people say ""I guess I'm just going to be alone forever"" but unless you've ever felt that feeling...it's just not something to say to someone. My deepest fear used to be fucking snakes. Now it's being alone for the rest of my life. The thought of it keeps me away at night. The anti-depressants barely keep me functional half the time so I don't even take them anymore. The stress and anxiety keeps me stuck in my bed during most of my free time. I just don't know how to shake this. When you're told how unattractive you are or how you're ""too nice"" or how you're ""too boring"" to date, you kinda get to a place where you just want to give up. I just wish I weren't so fucking alone all the time. Literally every second of every day I spend alone. And my so-called ""friends"" never answer the phone or respond to my texts but scream at me when I don't reply as soon as they text me. Life is just shitty right now.

Ok a 3 way voice call! Or maybe it can be up to 6 people. 

The plan: 

Have a discord voice call with random strangers, how I plan on deciding the groups is you dm me with your location, age, and gender and you pick a random letter A-M. You will be matched with me and a few other people who picked the same letter


I know a lot of people don’t like voice chats, let alone a voice chat with more than one person so the letter system may or may not work if I don’t get a lot of replies but hopefully I do!! I think it will be fun 

I want to start the calls around 10 or 11pm est (it’s about 9:15 rn) 

Rules: Be 16+ (idc about age as long as you are older than 16, like let’s get a 80 year old women and a 19 year old guy together in one vc ) 

Ahh plan to contribute to the conversation and make sure you are available after 10pm est

The joke is, my longest relationships were a year each, in high school and college respectively.

The joke is, I go on maybe one date a year. There's rarely a second date.

I turned 40 about a month ago. 

Most of the time I'm fine being alone. I'm an introvert who can go days without speaking to anyone and be fine. But I'm not close with any family, and my one close friend has slipped away, emotionally. I don't really have anyone I confide...well, anything in, anymore. I have a friend or two who asks how I am, but they don't really listen to the answer. 

And what is there to say, anyway? I exist. 

For some inexplicable reason I still bother going on dating apps occasionally, like the still walking body of a headless chicken.


I stopped wishing for love and a partner a long time ago. These days, I just wish for a quick, painless death, because

Speaking of dogs, I lost my dog, Calvin, in April. It still pains me. But we got a puppy soon after, shes super sweet. Her name is Butters. She's also a little shit and makes me really anxious most times, because I like things in order, while she wants to tear everything to shreds. And she has really long legs, so she just grabs things off of tables and runs away with them.

Theres this one guy I know, he's very open that he likes me, and wants me to touch his weiner. And whats more awkward is he says he's straight, but likes me, so I feel sort of.. Emasculated?

687,ChiefBeef_,1598228129,1,"(I decided to type this after just lying in bed trying to sleep for two hours overthinking if you want to imagine it from my perspective…)

I’m a 22(M) virgin and I’ve finally realised am in a pretty deep hole at the moment. I believe am I a position where my low confidence has prevented me from speaking to girls or attempting to get a girlfriend due to the fact I’m scared of ‘shooting my shot’ as they would say these days. This can be in positions of where I may be attracted to a girl and don’t have the guts to message/DM them, or even approach them if I was on a night out etc. This can be quite complicated though… as if the roles where switched and a girl was to message me or approach me for example, id have no problem talking but obviously this happens in a blue moon and most times I’ve not been attracted or into the girl.

I can’t deny, I’ve had multiple opportunities to speak/pull/have sex with girls on nights out, lads’ holidays and through my friends’ girlfriends’ friends (if that makes sense) and on multiple occasions I’ve kind of just played them down. 

I do feel as if it’s time to make a change.

My first step I feel I need to take is accepting an offer. So recently, a close friend of mine has said his girlfriend’s friend has been asking for single friends and he’s basically put it on a plate for me. The problem I have with this is I can jump straight onto it I just generally have no clue what I would talk or say to her over message etc. However, as mentioned before I would rather meet her in person straight away but nowadays it’s not a simple as that and I feel as if I’d need to talk to her for at least 2/3 week minimum before meeting her. I will admit, the fear of rejection is a massive problem of mine and this may be playing a bit part in my overthinking of outcomes from talking to her. As previously mentioned on some of my old posts I think I’m being completely dominated by the fact that near enough all my friends are in relationships at this point and I’m just waiting for the time to come for it to be my turn but, while am sat here doing nothing that time will never come.

I just don’t know what to do..... any tips would be massively appreciated, and I do see myself to be in an extremely fortunate position compared to others with a solid group of close knit friends and family around me at all times, however deep down am too much of a shithouse to express this out and just suppress it all massively. I do believe it’s time for me to change and be better for the future, ideally I think this should be now.

695,Active_Bandicoot_660,1598222871,1,"So I’ve (24M) realized a while ago that I’m lonely. Obviously I’ve came to the correct subreddit. 

*context*

I moved away from home two years ago because of “work” let’s just call it that. I did because I knew I’d have more opportunity elsewhere. I also knew that everyone in my shit hole hometown wasn’t going to encourage my growth. I had maybe two friends off the top of my head I could real connect with. 

Since then, I’ve found opportunities out the wazoo, but yet I still feel like I haven’t had a genuine relationship. Friendship wise or romantically either. I have a lot of friends from work that I love dearly. They’re are awesome guys. I just can’t remember the last time I’ve had a conversation with someone more than 30 minutes long about anything worth talking about other than memes or a TV show. 

I also have had little to no luck dating. Dating apps like Tinder are just horrendous. It boils people down to a 400 character bio (or however long it is idc). Literally everyone around me is either married, in a long term relationship m, or at the very least in a fling. I haven’t had anything close to a fling in three years. I’ve willingly worked on myself after my last relationship ended. Did a lot of self exploration and improved myself. I still seek improvement. Yet, anytime I try to attempt to get a girls number, or even seem interested I’m just kicked to the side for some dude named Tyler or Kyle who’s probably not going anywhere in life.

Things like social media have made me just disappointed in society as a whole. I have logged out of all my social media accounts and haven’t been back on in over a month. I plan on staying off for a while. I just feel like I’m just a person living in a world where I want to experience life and give it some actual meaning. Enjoy the little things. Go on adventures. Just be a human being. I’m surrounded by people who just live for the weekend, their gaming consoles, and getting plastered. These people also complain about their whack ass situations while they sit and do nothing about it. Like their health problems or their work life.

It’s a shame that you guys don’t realize that if 200million people have the same problem as you that should make you think how dumb of “life stoping” problem it really is. The truth is that when you die none of your problems will matter anyway. Life will continue to move and more people will have the same problem as you. And then on and on. It will never stop. So it’s ultimately pointless. Not saying give tryna find someone, but stop letting loneliness control your damn life. Stop ignoring people when they give you positive advice for once.

I am a 30 year old male living in the midwest with my fiance, and I'm currently looking for people who share my interests. They include mostly baseline 'nerd' things like Fantasy books and video games. Favorite author is Brandon Sanderson with Jim Butcher being a close second.  

I've also got hundreds upon hundreds of games in my steam and playstation libraries, and absolutely love to co-op almost anything with anybody. Favorite games to co-op include Vermintide 2 and Divinity Original Sin 2, but I'm also into Guild Wars 2, AoE 2 DE, etc. Truthfully I'd co-op mostly anything with the right people.

I consider myself a fairly laid-back person with an open heart and very casual game expectations. I savor experiences and fun over metas and min-maxing.  If you have any questions or would like to start a chat, feel free to comment, DM, or drop me your discord!

His birthday is comin up. I invited him out to hang. I tried my best to be kind and nice, took him to a nice place for lunch... bought him gifts and tried to make conversation.

727,ZeroRei13,1598192737,1,"I'm a guy, and I have a girl friend (notice the space. Girl friend, not girlfriend), who I've been friends with for 5 years. We know each other from Facebook, and we live in the same country but almost in the opposite ends of it and so we never met. We were meant to meet this summer but then coronavirus happened.

Anyway, initially, and by initially I mean for over 4 years, we only talked via messages. And that was fine, sometimes I only have a short thing to say that's not worth giving a phone call for. But then my OCD kinda... extended into covering other things, those things being my phone and laptop. I would keep checking things, like if I've logged out, etc, or I would repeatedly open and close apps. So for a while I stopped using my phone at all, and used an older-type phone to communicate with people. Now I use my phone again but I deleted Messenger because it was just stressing me just being there, so I still cannot talk with her via messages. So I gave her my new number and asked her to talk over the phone. We talked once in March, once in May (both times it was me asking her if she wants to talk), and then no signs from her until July, when again, of course, it was me who asked. But she kept making excuses. Eventually we did get to talk, and I told her that I don't want to force anyone to be my friend, and that if she doesn't want to be friends anymore, she should just tell me. She reassured me that she does want to talk, but she doesn't like phone calls. Since then I've tried to talk with her twice more, but both times she had excuses. It seems like, even if she does want to be friends, she'd rather not talk to me at all ever again, rather than talk to me in a phone call. It's been over a week since I last asked her to talk, and she didn't contact me at all. In between our phone calls, from March to May and from May to July, and from July to August, it was always me who asked to talk. She never did. She can say all she wants that she wants to be friends, but her actions isn't showing that. I genuinely believe that if I never ask her if she wants to talk again, then we'll never talk again. And if you're wondering why we can't talk over text from my older-type replacement phone, it's because it's with buttons. I know everyone used to use those back in the day, but now, and especially with the lenghty conversations that she and I used to have, it just wouldn't work. It'd take me like 5 minutes to write something I could, on a regular modern phone, write in 30 seconds.

Then there's this guy friend I have that I've given my new phone number to back in March and he still hasn't contacted me. Because of my OCD, I don't want to just go grab his phone number from the other phone, because then I'd be afraid I accidentally called someone, so I can't call him myself. But even if I did call him, he probabily wouldn't answer, OR he would, and we'd talk like normal, just like with the girl, but then unless I would contact him again, he wouldn't be contacting me, and evidence for that is the fact that it's near the end of August and he hasn't called me since March.

I realized I'm nobody's best friend. Everyone I'm friends with (or *supposedly* friends with) has a lot of friends. I saw a post on Reddit which put it the best: ""I'm the background friend.""",lonely,"Except one, none of my friends contact me first",2020-08-24 00:25:37

I haven't had a conversation with anyone in weeks.

The only ""friends"" i had was this one group of people I hang out with in high school, but they always exclude me in everything. Even went to japan together without me. Stopped hanging out with them years ago.

Looking at other's people Instagram/Facebook/twitter posts makes me angry, their lives are so fun while I've never had any fun in my life. Can't even bare to go outside, because then I have to look at people and couple having fun, you know, showing off their superior life in front of my face.

For a long time I never knew why I have no friends and can't get a girlfriend, thinking back, I think I finally understand why, My fucking parents. I believe that's the #1 answer, because of my parents I have no social life, I don't see any other reasons why.

1.Bad Genetic

To start off I am asian, so that's already a disadvantage, i think other races have it easier in North America. As if being asian is not bad enough, my parents passed on their shitty genetics to me. I am only 5'3"" just like my dad, have terrible facial structure like my mom, and have all sorts of skin problems from them, Vitiligo, flaky skins, acne. It's probably easier to list the skin problems that I DON'T have.

I am objectively ugly, I photoshopped my picture so they look as good as possible, and posted them on photofeeler (a site that rates your appearance) and various subreddits. Even with Photoshop I was rated 2-3/10 across the board.

When I was in elementary school other kids were disgusted and terrified of me. I had very flaky skin as if my entire face is falling off. They made fun of me, called me names (ex. cheese grater) and nobody wanted to hang out with me. My appearance looked worse later in life, I have serious acne problems and there are white spots all over my body, the last time my face were clear was 9 years ago.

Also my parents gave birth to me when they were very old. My dad was in his 60s and my mom was in her late 30s when I was born. I don't know the exact science but there's a high chance this contributes to my genetic problems. This makes my parents selfish douches, they knew they have genetic problems, and that they are too old for children, yet they still decided to gave birth to me knowing that I will live a miserable life.

The halo effect is in no doubt one of the reasons I don't have friends, people don't have a good impression of me just because of my appearance. And for dating, since studies showed that women go for top % of men I pretty much have no chance.

On top of that I was born male, while means I lost the coin toss when it comes to social life, had I been a women I would have had an easier time having a social life at least imo, no matter what I look like. I had 50% chance of having friends and easy dates and my parents blew it, they lost the coin toss.

​

2.My parents refused to settle down and instead moved everywhere when I was younger

Other people live in one place throughout most of their childhood life. I am different, I wanted to settle down and live in the same place, but my parents just kept on moving and moving. Every 1 to 2 years I move to a new place. In total I had attended 6 different elementary schools and 4 different high schools in 4 different countries. Every moment in my life, I was the ""outsider"", the ""new guy"", or ""the guy that don't speak our language"". Had I lived in one place for a long time, people would had accepted me into their group. Even right now in my university, everyone had their own little groups already and I don't have one, which makes the social scene even more difficult for me.

More importantly, because my parents move around a lot, I don't speak good English. I stutter a lot and have a heavy Chinese accent. Probably because of this people don't want to hang out with me since talking with me is frustrating.

​

3.My parents taught me to distrust white people, taught me that sex/relationship is a bad thing, and told me to focus on STEM career over a social life

When I was younger, my dad will often goes on about how white people is objectively the evilest group of humans ever existed. He told me about Nazi Germany, British colonization, slavery of black people, and how terrible Hong Kong was under British rule. He told me stories of how badly Americans had treated him when he was working in the US 40 years ago. Overtime I became wary of white people and didn't want anything to do with them. Even today I am afraid to talk to white people, especially when I had some bad experiences of my own. (ex. telling me to pronounce 333333 in English, laughed with all her friends when I tried.)

Sex and relationship is also things that got lumped together with gambling and drugs when I was younger. Because of my parents, I had always believed dating to be something I do in my 30-40s so I never tried to pursue it during my teenage years. As if being a 5'3"" asian man in North America is not bad enough in the dating world, I started thinking about dating very late when I was 21. I still never had a date no matter how hard I try. Been on 6 dating apps for 3 years and still nothing. I might have had better luck if I started earlier.

And because of my parents pressure to enter a STEM field, I am currently stuck in a major that I hate. Studying had always been my no 1 focus because my parents taught me that's the only thing that's important, like I don't even have a phone until I was 19 so I can't text or call anyone, and my social media accounts was made when I was 20.....I literally only have 14 friends on Facebook, and most of them are my family and my family's friends.

I am in my seventh year in my university and I don't know if I will ever graduate. And the people in my major have nothing common with me, I just can't click with them. Right now my parents keeps on asking me how's school and when I will graduate. Because of this I sometimes feel bad about just attending social events.

​

​

I am sick of being stuck in my room every day, doing everything by myself, and seeing other people having the time of their lives. My education is going nowhere and will likely be stuck in a field I hate for the rest of my life, I missed out my youth, I am lonely af while other people my age especially women are or were partying all day, having amazing sex, and living a fun carefree life. I am getting old and my future is bleak.

733,cosmic1125,1598185558,1,"Hello everyone, like the title says, I lost my close friends last night and I am very distraught over this.  


Prepare for a wall of text, there's a lot of context and my brain is all over the place right now. I'm sorry but it's the best I can do. 

&amp;#x200B;

It all started because I had been trying to vent to them about how they don't really offer me help or consolation when I come to them about my personal issues. I also felt like they were forgetting me too much and that I wasn't being included in the group as much as I used to. For some background, my parents are rather toxic and not very emotionally intelligent, so I have a lot of problems with them both mentally and emotionally. I also believe I am a trans individual and they would not be okay with that so I feel like I have to hide that part of me from them. I'm looking to get an apartment with a roommate around the end of September so I can finally start being myself.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends would sometimes notice my stress and offer to help me out and talk to me but whenever I do go to talk to them all they really give me is ""That sucks"" or ""Try harder"" when I've been trying so hard I'm at the point of exhaustion. Sometimes they could get more in depth and say something along the lines of me being so much better than my parents and how I won't turn out like them, but that's about it. They supported the hell out of me transitioning which I was really grateful for, but they fell short almost everywhere else. I could pour my heart out to them because all I wanted was for someone to tell me they loved me or appreciated me or like I just wanted someone to take genuine notice of how I feel and ask about it. I don't feel like I ever got that but they insist they gave it to me and that they were doing their best. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anywhoo, back to the main story.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day one of my friends messaged me asking if I would be over this Saturday, but I didn't know that plans were made for us all to chill. This happened a quite a few times with this group, giving me such short notice that I need to cancel other stuff to go or because of getting out of work so late and the hangout starting so early that by the time I show up everyone is about to leave. They've also had a few gatherings without inviting me, so I've only been included in a couple in recent times, even before I started to crack and buckle from the stress. I replied with something like ""I had no idea this was going on, why can't I be informed sooner why can't you guys tell me shit??"".  


I acknowledge that this isn't a great choice of words, but I don't think it's explicitly hostile or aggressive to the point of crossing the line. My friend replied, getting pissed off, saying stuff like ""Oh yeah you're gonna come get fucking mad at me when you said you'd be here?"". But again, I had literally no idea about this so how could I have said I was going? I messaged the friend who had organized it, and I was really upset. Every time I had been forgotten about came rushing back for some reason, and with how much people have been avoiding me, and how much I've tried talking things out but getting absolutely nowhere, I was so sad and upset. I sent him a whole wall of text about how upset I was about not being included and how I wanted to be remembered more, I threw in some curse words which I regret heavily and probably shouldn't have done. But it wasn't like ""Hey bud I'm gonna kick your ass"" kind of cursing, it was like ""I want an explanation. Now"" kind of cursing. I don't think that makes it okay, but he took that as me cussing him out and refuses to talk to me after that. He did reply with ""Yeah I was gonna ask you tonight if you wanted to go to his house tomorrow after work."", in which I instantly felt horrendous and freaked out and told him that since I'm blowing up for no reason I'm going to get out of everyone's hair. I deleted them from snapchat and removed myself from all the groups they were in. I grabbed my bag and some water and just wondered around for a couple of hours at midnight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I messaged one of them on messenger after I had been out and about with no contact for a bit, because I felt like no one cared. She said she cared and loved me but in the end anything I told her she just denied and said I needed to calm down. I definitely needed to calm down, but nobody would level with me. It feels like nobody cares and I feel so worthless. I didn't plan on leaving for good but I wasn't planning on coming back either if that makes sense. She told me to come over the next day to talk everything through but seeing as how only one person tried reaching out to me even 48 hours later I don't feel like they want to see me or be around me. She forgot about having me over to talk things through that day, and the plans we had to hangout today. I feel like such a piece of shit that I don't even deserve to be around them. I don't feel like they would ever treat me the same after this and when I tried voicing this concern all they said was ""We tried if you don't wanna be our friend then that's on you""  


Couldn't they have understood that I'm just low key losing it and told me that it would be okay with time and that they would love me no matter what?? Couldn't they have said they would treat me normally and still respect/view me the same after all this blew over?? Couldn't they have just said that those feelings weren't true?

&amp;#x200B;

I deleted messenger for good, and uninstalled instagram after that.   


I just couldn't get anywhere with anyone. No one understands that I feel isolated and forgotten about. They side step so many of the points I make and it eventually always comes down to me being at fault for everything. They were my everything over these last four or so years that I knew and hung out with them and it's all gone and I feel like I'm going crazy. I know I can trust my memories and experiences and that I'm not wrong for the most part but also they keep telling me I'm wrong and stand firmly by what they say. I don't know what to believe anymore and I feel like I'm a terrible person and my brain is so jumbled that it's honetly getting hard to finish this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand why they pushed me away so quickly and are okay with me up and disappearing with all the issues they know I have. And they know I don't have much other than them, it feels like they don't care and they never really did. I know I made the decision to leave and unfriend everyone, but wouldn't you try come after your friend that's suicidal and severely depressed if they were isolating and freaking out??

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do or where to go from here. I don't know how to make friends and I feel like I'm entirely in the wrong but part of me says that I'm not all wrong and that they could've been better too. But the negative thoughts usually win over.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the unorganized and messy and probably gap filled personal story, but I just need to get it out there.

None who teeters the lines of extrovert and introvert waaaay to often. I need people in my life to feel happy. But if I were no to have any, I think I’d be fine. Well that what I thought at least. A month before quarantine started u lost all my friends from own stupidity. and to add to that I had the worst week of my life. Where everything and everyone crumbled around me. I started cutting myself and hurting myself so I could feel some sort of retribution for my actions. But it didn’t work out. When the quarantine started no one talked to me. I was fine with it. No one noticed me. And I was fine with that. As far as I knew m. Everyone thought I was dead. And you know, I feel like I am. Now love is a very confusing topic for me. Let’s just say for being 14, my run ins with with the 4 letter word has been less than satisfactory. My last run in with it was the whole reason I lost all my friends in the first. It hurt so much that I’ve been trying to repress any feelings or memories I had towards them. Even just things that remind me of them hurt me in a way I can’t comprehend. And so “life” goes on. I’ve been alone for the past 5 months. My contact with people other than my family has been scarce, and somehow my already pretty shit social anxiety has worsened. Remember when I said that I need people to feel happy. Well I do. But I also thought that I’d never need love either, or friends. BOY was I wrong. Last night I had a dream. There was a girl. A relatively beautiful one who was just my type in personality and appearance. I was at my old school with my friends and we were all hanging out. Laughing and having fun. Like none of the stuff I did ever happened. And the girl I was with, I was holding her in my arms. And I felt warmth and her heartbeat. And it felt so nice and calming. I haven’t felt anyone since quarantine started, and even before quarantine I never hugged or felt someone at all other than my mother, who didn’t even like hugs anyway. But the warmth of that girl in my dream made me feel so happy. And my friends and I were all together sitting in the classroom without a care in the world. And I was so happy. It felt like it was real. Like all the things I’ve gone through in the last 6 months was just a bad dream and I’m just now starting to wake up. But then I woke up for real. And I felt happy and sad at the same time. The reason I’m so confused is because during the past 5 months I refused to talk to anyone, think about my friends or anything related to them, or think about school and love. And I was doing fine. Well as fine as a socially deprived teenager can be. I was on my way to forgetting the my long loathed past and moving on. But that dream. That dream dragged my deepest desire to the surface. Shoved them into in my face. And told me that what I’m doing to myself is not what I want. But I know I can’t change it. My friends have all loved on to better things. In this day and age we can barley walk alongside each other let alone hold each other. And I can barley communicate to people unless it’s on the internet or it’s family. After I woke up my heart which was once broken felt like it wanted to repair itself. But I can’t do it. So I came to reddit. I wanted to find an answer. I wanted to know why I feel this longing to be with people. To be in love. To be human. But I didn’t find any. I went to r/love to find out why people love and cherish others. But only to find nothing. I went to r/confessions to find people who lost others because of their actions and find out what they did afterward. But it didn’t help. I started tearing up at the prospect that I may never know why I want to be loved or why I want friends and a loved one. Because all this time I had this mindset that I can live without those things. But after that dream. I don’t think I can. Just might break even more if anything else happens. So that’s what led me here writing a essay long to get an a in a high school English class. I just need some sort of answer so I can understand myself and find out what I should do. So reddit please tell me. What makes you want to aspire to have loved ones and friends?

I finished  writing my 5th short story as a way to cope with my inner darkness and my past mistakes. Years ago I have always dreamed of finding that special person in the presence of unpredictability, but due to my insecurities and the women I have talked to were unavailable (whether they were gay or taken or both), my negativity got worse. Having friends with gay girls left me more open to the climate of accepting people who they are regardless of a preference to sexuality, but I was not without frustration for the trend kept going on, leaving me to think that I will never find someone. I was very close friends with this one girl. She was very sweet to me and really was there for me whenever I needed a push to keep going but long story short, I verbally injured her all because of how frustrated I was when she told me that it will happen to me. I didn't think it was going to happen to me because of my limited chances. I am introverted and she was not. She was also a girl. I didn't think she understood me. I was blaming the fact that she was gay or God or whatever. I took things literally to heart while not thinking that shit just happens and sometimes the chances can be slim at an early age. I did this more than once to girls all because I simply wanted more and that the chances becomes more slim as life goes on, because life gets busy, and we change over time. 6 years later things have not changed unfortunately even though I try. Under a pandemic it is very difficult. I really wish that I got to experience sex (I'm a virgin) or really getting the chance to connect with someone, but I can't change that. Life goes on whether you like it or not. During my spare time I use my writing as a way to cope with my frustrations and my dark thoughts, so I finished writing a short that serves as a metaphor to my experiences with these girls, and especially with her. I confess that I was the villain and I confess that I lost a really good friendship all because that I wanted more and thinking that it will get harder and harder, leaving zero chances for me. Rather than focus on the negative (talking to girls, thinking I am not good enough, pushing people away) I use this piece of writing as a way to cope with my past mistakes. I can't change what I did. She probably still hates me, but all I can hope is that wherever she is, I hope she is doing well. I dedicate this piece of short fiction to her. I am sorry for what I have done.

But the same others I write about i know aren't going to see it.  Or if I post it,  I'm now being passive aggressive.  And I don't mean to be.  I'm looking around, and there isn't anyone near.  Best friends become partners to someone else,  until they become preoccupied absorbing the energy of another, until they drift away. Move a couple hours away and wait a couple years. Drive 15k miles to see friends and family who would never do the same. Realize that something being gripped isn't really there.
28, I made it a year past going out like a Rockstar. Im not truly suicidal,  more just afraid. Something better is probably coming. I have to remind myself nightly. I equate a lot of self worth with my job.  I got laid off when the oil market sank. A few job interviews haven't panned out yet. Its hard being the person I would be with a promising future during the interview, as opposed to the desperate person I feel I am inside for a promising change. 
Im told im smart, I probably am, which is what makes the depressive realism all the scarier. When $500 can change your whole life,  how much is a life worth? I choose not to ponder that for too long.

781,lifeisaslowdeath,1598150896,1,"I(25M) had a bad experience in my childhood, that still effects me and I am having trouble getting into sexual relationship with anyone. I don’t know if this is the right place to share it or not, but I am sharing, sorry if it’s wrong place I need to get it off my chest, I have never told this story this to anyone and I am telling the story with new account because I cannot do it on my real account.

I used to live in the gated community, it was nice area and everyone who was living there was very friendly and nice. All the neighbors knew each other there very well. In that community on each gate there was a guard, the guard that was on the door that was closest to our home always said hello to my parents whenever I am going anywhere with my parents , my parents always told me say hello to him and shake his hands. Also whenever we cook something special we share it with that guard too(its kind of tradition where I used to live, food was shared with other close neighbors too not just guard). Most of the time I was the one who gives him the food, I was in 5th or 6th grade at that time. One day I was riding my bike and I saw him and he stopped me. He started asking questions how am I and stuff like that. He asked me if I know anything about computers, I told him yes. He said he bought a computer but he doesn’t know how to set it up, he asked me to help him out. I said ok, at that point he was like family friend, he knew my whole family very well. I went to his apartment and asked him where is the computer. I was sitting there and he was sitting beside me, he started saying weird things started touching me inappropriately, that worst thing I have ever felt in my life and told him to  stop but he didn’t, somehow I managed to get up and tried to run away, but instead of going to exit door I went in other direction, I was completely losing my mind and lost all my sense of direction, I wanted to scream but I couldn’t. He said door is in other direction, I ran towards the door and open it got on bike and biked as fast as possible. I kept on looking if he is following me or not. He didn’t. I got home went to the shower and cried a lot. The thing is after that incident he was still on the guard duty, so whenever I wanted to go somewhere I used other doors. After a month or 2 he went away somewhere, never saw him after that. 

I still blame myself for going with him and trusting him. After that incident stopped talking to people, I stopped sharing anything with anyone. I don’t know why I became like that. I am trying to change by sharing. also now whenever I try to be intimate with anyone it doesn’t work out, I don’t feel good, when someone touch me it doesn’t feel right. I never had a relationship it always ended with some interaction.

It gets very lonely living in foreign country without family, and its hard to find someone and share these kind of feelings. I live in Helsinki and in winters the weather makes the life more miserable and sad. Today weather was very gloomy. Not a big fan of grey weather.

I’m someone who feels pretty lonely from time to time, I’ve been just trying to keep myself busy. During the work week I generally am too tired and good at filling the day up so I don’t have time or energy to feel lonely.

However when the weekend finally comes around, there’s a day or two where I have absolutely nothing going on. Normally I have no issues with just staying at home and watching tv, playing video games and not interacting with people at all. But lately I’ve been feeling too lonely to enjoy my alone time, which is weird since I’ve generally really enjoyed alone time. 

As I’m writing this, I’m just sitting outside in my backyard trying to text anyone that I think would come over and hangout. But people have other things going on today or are tired out from things they did yesterday... or they just don’t respond. I understand that people live their own lives and have other things going on but it really sucks when I’ve been looking forward to the weekend all week and then when it comes, I can’t even enjoy it like I thought I could. I’m not even sure what I want. I want to be alone and enjoy time by myself, but it’s not fun. But honestly I don’t even know if I want people to come and hang out either because I’m socially exhausted from being at work all week. It’s kinda hard to explain... like I would really like to be able to just enjoy myself without feeling lonely but I do feel lonely, yet I don’t really want to meet with people either...

I went through a depressive phase. I lost motivation and I just felt really disconnected from people for a while. I want to get back out there and meet people again, but maybe people from a similar background. 

I think the reason I hesitate with some other groups, is I don't know if I can be an extrovert again or be as open as I used to be. So other opportunities I have to connect with people, are intimidating. 

I feel like on this forum, there are people in a similar position. If we started setting up meets, would people be interested? 

I'm hoping it will be easier as we'll know how tentative people may be, and that they might need more encouragement to be open. 

I am based in Liverpool. But if other people are interested and live elsewhere, if you comment. I'm sure you guys can organise something too. Or I don't mind helping plan a few things to get people started.

Now to my real problems.
I don't know what I am. I can encourage almost every single one of you. I've already commented on a few posts, and hopefully they made the OPs feel good. I can boost others. I can do work, in person, to take care of others. But not for me. Every goal I've set just for me has failed. Help friend build shed? I'm in, done. Build shed for self? Can't afford the materials, or can't get permit, whatever. Every single time. I fail when doing for me. I succeed when doing for others.
But what about me? What about my needs? If I love someone, I can't ask for anything. I can't be vulnerable. I can be there for them, sure. I can be there best friend. But I can't ask or expect them to be there for me. Nobody is ever there when I need them. But I'm always there when they need me. And now my current issue.
I fell in love. Like a fool, I fell in love. We barely knew each other. She made a social media post that was vaguely sad. As a sad person I reached out. She answered. We spent that entire day together. And then the next. And a few more over the following weeks. I won't bore you with the details, but she changed my life. We became friends. Then I loved her. Then I had real feelings for her. Then I fell in love with her. I had a serious mental health breakdown... Depression mostly. Crippling depression. It took two weeks to come back from. It was her that brought me back. I didn't have anything else. She was the only thing in this world that was real to me. And a told her. Like a fool, I told her. The more people that know a thing, the more real it becomes. So I told her. And then later, after it was all over on my end... After my break... We talked in person. I told her everything I could. And now, she's pushing me away. My favorite person. My best friend. It doesn't matter that I'm in love with her. She's my favorite person. And she's pushing me away. All because I am too much.

I do have a few really good friends (not a group as such), and dont even think other people view me as a loner, a bit awkward maybe but thats all.

I've just always felt weird and if I ever get feelings for someone I seem to scare them off without knowing exactly what I'm doing, I find it hard to fill my days when not working and am just stuck with crippling anxiety all of the time, no hobbies as such, I have interests such as music and video games, movies to an extent, i love nature, long walks etc, very aware of history and world events and am often told im contuientious and a good person etc..

Just feel as though I've been in a rut for years now and struggling to find any fulfillment, just like a jigsaw piece without a puzzle, it's hard to open up to anybody either without seemig desperate, i don't think I'm depressed as this comes in waves sometimes I feel great when I'm distracted.

As you can guess from what I said I'm depressed and I have Asperger's as well ( social skills=0). Due to mainly these two things I've been used and haven't had a real friendship in a while. And by a while I mean like several years. The only real one I've had I've had to deal with them drifting away. Luckily the medication I take makes it easier however it's still hard to do pretty much anything anymore.                                                                  I get it when people say"" live for you"" but I've been trying so long to do that and it's really hard. When there's no one to really motivate me or give me a reason to do something it takes so much effort but when there's someone on the other side like playing games or wanting to do something with me it's so easy and effortless.

It seems like whenever I put myself out there people are quick to retract from me. If I were to give it a guess it's because I'm pretty weird. Not in a bad way, just I listen to different music then most people, I spend my time surrounded in the arts, I say things incorrectly sometimes when talking to coworkers because I can be shy and timid and I don't carry on conversations in the same ways. I'm pretty ADHD so often I need people to repeat what they say because I'm so concentrated on something else. 

All this has lead me to feel pretty lonely in a room for as long as I can remember. Even when I was dating more years ago it never felt like that person who could look at me with the same eyes I gave them was ever there. I was always emotionally distant from people I dated. Waiting for someone who I could finally let go with to lose myself in. Someone who was on the same wavelength intellectually, emotionally, physically, but it it never happened. 

I grew tired of hurting people so I stopped dating. I stopped pushing myself into social situations. I caved in on myself a bit. 

It's been two years since I've last had sex. It's been two years since I've laid down with someone and just stroked their hair and brushed their back softly.

Today makes the 1 year anniversary of me [19M] moving 1000 miles away from my home to go to my dream college. I moved south because of what my brothers told me, “move away from home, push yourself outside of your comfort zone and you will be amazing with how much you grow”. Well, the only thing that grew on my was a feeling of worthlessness and insecurity. All I see around me are kids my age that are so much more mature or interesting or attractive than me. How do they already have so much more figured out. So much as talking to someone in the hall fills me with dread. Each semester starts the same, I’m so excited to meet new people; to finally get rid of being alone, except I can’t leave my bed I’m so overcome with the fear of humiliating myself. Since coming to college I’ve met people who eventually ghost me and end up just adding to the long list of snapchat stories I watch that only make me sink further into my whole. I’m done here. I can’t even quit and go home, my mother would be so upset. She’s already managing a divorce and counseling of her own, I can’t burden her with this. If I was to die, I don’t think anyone would notice.",lonely,"Feeling alone, and unneeded in this life",2020-08-22 16:09:29

I remember wishing that I could just have any friend and that how great that would be. My wish came true I made a bunch of friends. Last year in middle school was fun with them and probably the peak of my life but then highschool came. Now my friends were into drugs so I made other friends. These friends had a super racist sense of humor (the only humor in the group) so I made friends. This friend groups humor was collecting shit on each other and insulting each other. And now I’m in a friend group that’s super ignorant. They say kill all men, insult me for being a male and make fun of my height yet if I commented about their features they’d “expose me” on Snapchat or something. At the end of the day it always feels like I can’t win. Materialistic wise I have everything I could ever want except friends who I am comfortable with. It might be just bad luck but it still sucks. All I wanna say is that having friends isn’t always that great and that you having fun with what you do is most likely better than having friend in my case at least.",lonely,I have friends yet I’m still lonely.,2020-08-22 15:18:44

 HOWEVER!!!! I would like to make some quality friendships before I go. I will uninstall reddit in 3 days and we can talk in instagram because it's the only social media I use beside whatsapp (which we can use if we click and are willing to exchange numbers). 

Ok this post is probably long enough already so here are 3 points on what I'm looking for. 

1. I want us to be friends that can tell each other anything. I want us to be able to make our darkest jokes and say our weirdest thoughts without fear of being judged. You have my shoulder to lean on at 3am if you're feeling sad and need someone in your corner, and I'd like to know that you're there for me as well. 

2. I'm looking for mainly female friends. Not because I'm a nasty pervert trying to fuel my sick perversion through reddit.....I just get along better with girls dude....chill. Most of my friends irl are female, so I guess that's like proof or something idk. 

3. Lastly, please be understanding. I'm going through somewhat of a junction in my life. I'm 18, I have to get things in order so that the rest of my life isn't shit. Therefore I won't have a ton of time on my hands and if I do then it's probably because I'm not doing what I should. I also go through a lot of emotional phases and I am still finding myself and finding my footing to this journey of life. If I can find someone likeminded then we will be friends for a very long time.

895,nbcool123,1598047880,1,"    Most of my friends have been girls and I have been surrounded by mostly female friends my whole life.  It was cool and all to smoke weed and drink with them and all and go out dancing, but that was in college.
    Now I find myself lonely and looking for a girlfriend or someone to talk to, but what I think I need are more guy friends to go out and hang out with.  But here’s the thing, I’m not into cars or sports or into any of that shit. I use to watch wrestling lol.  
     I tend to gravitate towards women because it’s my safe zone and that’s been such a crutch for me.
     I had an abusive childhood and pretty much all of the male figures in my family beat me for shit- maybe because I didn’t do well enough in school or I was to quiet or sad the wrong things.  
     I’m the youngest from West Indian parents, and being the young one, my role was to keep quiet and listen and not talk back.  
     I was born in NY and moved to GA when I was 6 so I pretty much grew up with white people lol. I always felt left out for the most part but I did have a few friends i.e. I was the tag along. 
     Now I’m my older age (33) I find that I don’t have the social skills or the sense of humor needed to be mentally happy in day to day stresses.
     I come home and go straight into my room.  Life is sucking bad for me. I had issues with addiction, dui, been to two rehabs and damaged my credit.  So I had to move in with my parents. I mean my credit was so fucked that I can’t apply for a credit card now even though I’m in the 700’s.  
     I don’t know how to open up to people without getting too personal and talking about problem because I learned the hard way that those are topics I should stay away from.  
      I wish I could laugh at my mistakes and be more firm with people as opposed to blaming myself in every situation. 
       Counseling doesn’t work to well and meds have slightly been helping.  
       I started taking sublingual Ketamine from my Psychiatrist about a month ago and realized a drastic reduction in my anxiety and depression. However my mood is still pretty flat.  
       I need and want a group of friends I can talk to on the regular but everyone is getting married and doesn’t have time for anything else.  I schedule dates with girls and most of them flake out or take out their frustration on me because I’m a nice guy (which is a curse). I don’t know how to say know or delegate. Being the youngest in my family I’m used to being told to follow instruction which is bullshit in adulthood.  I’m tired of being the quiet follower and idk what to do. 
     I have no close connections with anyone and feel empty inside and I recently started smoking cigarettes again just to deal with frustration- even though the ketamine has helped with my addiction as well.  
     I would like to go out and drink with the people I work with but due to my past with addiction my mom will allow me to use her credit card and I pay her back from my bank account.  I’m not saying I want to get drunk again, I just want to get out and have a few drinks with the people from work but my mom monitors what’s on the credit card lol.  Last time my work family went to World of Beer and I turned them down for obvious reasons.  Even though the ketamine has helped me beat the obsession with drugs and alcohol, I still need a social life. 
    I’m fucking lonely, my brother and mom have gotten all religious all of a sudden and once I get home they are watching religious videos( I’m Hindu btw) not trying to sound like a bigot, but those videos are boring as fuck (please GOD don’t smite me lol).  So I go on my room and have pretty much no one to talk to. 
    With this pandemic going on, I’ve reconnected with an ex-big mistake, same red flags.  I met a girl who was recently divorced from a West Indian man- another big mistake.  I met a girl who is into Indian men only which is weird but she always busy and she’s got some issues too.  
    Idk where I’m going with this.  I just want connection with people but don’t know how to elevate myself.

I had a small vacation a few days ago and right now, I'm sitting home alone again during an on-call shift and my mind just wont shut the f\* up. I'm rethinking my whole life right now and it makes me sad, everything feels bad right now. My job (which I liked so far), my flat, my...everything. This happens to me all the time when I'm alone and don't have anyone to distract me. The second I came back from vacation I got depressed. I know it sounds very obvious, but when I think about it I just have one problem: ""I'm not happy anymore"". 

I really fear that I've probably developed some psychological disorder? I feel depressed, without a specific reason. Things I liked before, now feel bad. Also, I'm somehow getting paranoid. I fear that I'll loose my job or that the police knocks on my door and arrests me, even though I have never done anything bad (not even got a parking ticket my whole life).

This changed five years ago. 

I fell in love with a girl who didn't reciprocate my feelings. At first, this rejection didn't hurt me much (I was in the stage of denial), but as time went by I started to enter into a downward spiral that has led me to depression. I have not seen her for three years, but I am more in love with her than never; I am in awe of how beautiful and friendly and wonderful she was when I befriended her. I can't be attracted to anybody else. I cry every night for this reason. 

I've tried every single method that I've read on the internet to get over unrequited love and my emotional state has only gotten worse. I'm actually starting to believe that the only way I will get out of this is committing suicide and hoping that heaven exists so I can be with her once and for all.

922,nqekm,1598025290,1,"I'm sorry if this is going to be long or not. I've always had a bad habit of drifting away of one topic to another one and so one. So I will try my best to stay on one topic. This will be a brief history of me to give you an idea of why I'm like this I guess.

I'm a 17 year old and I've been feeling lonely for some time. Unemployed, dropped out, and mentally unstable. I've had people I talked to in the past though. But only had one that I really considered a friend. I've had a really rough childhood. Alcoholic dad and slightly abusive mom. Never really got along with other kids considering I was fat. I developed insecurities at a really young age. I had a bit of hair on my legs at 3rd grade while others didn't. I had a deep voice at a young age too. Acne came early. I was depressed and anxious of what people thought. I had things other kids didn't have at that age. So obviously I was mostly lonely all throughout elementary. Bullied mentally and physically (never told anyone about the physical part) but you know I did my best to ignore. I managed. (Note: my dad went to jail when I was around 10 and my mom was a single mom working her ass off to provide for our family of 5 including me for years. Became less abusive. My 3 oldest brothers also moved out so it was just me, my sister, and my mom.)

Then (7th grade) middle school rolled in and obviously it got worse. I was skinnier though but kids still point out something to bully about me. I've already had insecurities to start with so I just wanted to run away from school to somewhere. Not home. Just somewhere away from everyone to cry and hit myself for being like this. But I couldn't. Didn't want to make it obvious that I was affected by them. So I did what I always have been doing and ignored. About fall in 7th I noticed facial hair. I didn't care though. I actually liked it lol. But around winter I noticed something off about my back. It was curved. I had scoliosis. Never really noticed. Didn't pay attention to sitting up straight. I hated it. I tried having good posture but it hurt to sit up straight (note. My scoliosis is worse). But I just gave up and continued with it I guess. January. I had a really bad bully. He was in most of my classes too. Embarrassed me in front of my crush. Gave me a really hard time. Harassed me. Made me lose my confidence even more. Whenever I had a good haircut or new clothes he always had something to say. But I still managed throughout the rest of 7th. I still managed.

Then 8th grade oh God. It was rough. Already fucking bullied straight off the bat. Scoliosis. Acne. Deep voice. Greasy face. Just everything at one hit me the first week of school. I couldn't handle it anymore. I just wanted to have someone to understand my situation. I fucking hated myself even more. I went home from school on Friday and cried in the bathroom (note. We had a 2 bedroom apartment so I shared a room with my mom while my brother shared one with our sister.). I came out after an hour and grabbed a knife and well... Started cutting my wrists and face. It hurt a lot but after sometime it took the pain away. Distracted me. I DON'T EVER CONDONE IT. Please don't EVER hurt yourself (Below I will provide a suicide hotline). And on Monday I went to school and people saw. Said it was a new cat problem. Can't believe they believed me. Either that or they just wanted a way to just not talk about it anymore. After that I stopped going. My whole mental health state just was at a all time low. Depression consumed me. Anxiety too. PTSD. A lot of things. Hurting myself even more. I went to a state mental hospital. didn't helped. And it was just a cycle. Started online dating at 14 because I had no luck in person and honestly... It was great. Although it wasn't physical I was happy for a moment. Sure they didn't see me in person but I showed them how I look and they still loved me. I gained confidence. Sending selfies, talking over the phone, video calling. They helped. But depression can really kill a person's mind and it got the best of me. You see I don't like telling people this but I'm bipolar. I have more depressive than manic. It was during my depressive moment. I just lost confidence. Thought she was gonna leave me and I started hurting myself again. Worse than before. Couldn't control it. Went back to the hospital for 2 weeks instead of a normal week stay. Still didn't help. As time went on she did break up with me. I regret what I said though. I said if she breaks up with me I'll kill myself. I was stupid. But obviously I didn't. And time passed by fast. I was unstable but I managed.

Turned 15. Still dropped out. Was more mentally stable due to medication. Realized my past actions and I started to kinda.... Help my mental state? I started finding coping skills. I had online friends I text a lot. Played games with. Fortnite, Black ops 2, etc. I went 6 months without hurting myself. Was proud. My mom was proud. Still depressed here and there with a bit of anxiety but medication helped. Then I stopped taking medication. Realized how lonely I was. And stopped. I don't know why. I thought that I didn't need them anymore. And for a time yeah I didn't. I didn't want to rely on a pill. And I helped myself become happier without them. But like I said my mom was a single mother. We were well.. homeless. For a time. My mom had friends though. Friends that provided a place to stay. A place as in one room. All of us in one room. I hated my mom's friend. He was immature and just overall mean. Mean as his actions. He had roomates. 3 bedroom apartment. 2 were taken by his roommates. It was during winter too. So when we would sleep in the room he would sleep in the car. Though I felt bad I was grateful. Still hated him though. Then he got tired of sleeping in the car. Understandable but he told us that we have to sleep in the car. So we did. One word: cold. I had a thick blanket but damn. Shivering all night. Couldn't sleep. we would put a blanket to cover the front car window because security would drive around. One time we got caught. And he went back to his apartment and he didn't open the door and we would just stay in the kitchen all night. Got depressed. But at times when my mom had enough money we would get a room at a hotel for a night. IT. WAS. THE. BEST. Warm, free WiFi, AND A SHOWER!!! I loved it. I would play fortnite with my online friend all night and I had a blast. My mom's friends room didn't have wifi. So we would walk to the library everyday and stay there for hours. (Note: didn't get wifi till recently lol) And my mom had another friend who would drive us to the hotel and back. One day my mom's friend told us we couldn't stay anymore I think. So my mom's friend who would drive us to the hotel got us a place to stay for a while. Again. A room. A strangers house. But warm. Grateful. No wifi though. Although it was a rough 6+ months we managed.

After some time we stayed at my mom's friend apartment (the one who gave us a ride). AND AGAIN A ROOM. But still was grateful. It was good. Wifi. Food. We were happy.  Had a girlfriend online. I was happy. And after some time we got kicked out (my mom's friend was renting the place though and the owner said that we gotta move out. Even my mom's friend.). LUCKILY he got a apartment. No room. Just an apartment for us 5. It's warm here. I like it. Wifi too. Lost my PS4 though cause when we would sleep in the car I kept my PS4 in the trunk but it got towed. Oh well I play on pc though. Low end PC but I got good games. But I still felt lonely. No friends. I'm bipolar and my online friends didn't like my depressive moments. I only have 1 online friend but I feel like I bother them. Had a breakup a few months back so a lot of people I text online stopped talking to me. Haven't been on social media in weeks. Nobody really texts me anymore. I find myself just playing videogames all day. And at night just YouTube. Quiet. I like to call myself a talkative introvert. Meaning that I hate socializing but I love talking lol. I feel uncomfortable socializing outside of home. I stutter, sweat, etc. Currently have non existent finger nails since I'm a nail biter when I'm nervous LOL. But yeah. I feel lonely. I've applied for 4 jobs but didn't get it. Applying for another one as of right now though. Still trying. I still have insecurities. Still have scoliosis. No acne though. Deep voice but I've grown into it. I have a gap between my two front teeth though. And I hate it. But with corona the masks covers it LOL. Although being lonely has its moments. When I get a haircut there's no one to criticize me. So I feel good. New clothes are the best too. Although I'm fat again I've been exercising a bit to get back in shape. But most of the time I just find myself doing the same thing over and over again. I sleep in the living room alone so it gets lonely. Really lonely. Although it's rough now I'm trying to help myself be better again. Applying for jobs, going outside more, etc. I'm 4 months clean from hurting myself too. So I'm happy about that. But I'm scared that depression will consume me again. Scared to be in my 20's, 30's, etc alone. No friends. No partner. I do pray to have a family though and a wife who will love me greatly. But who knows? I'm not rushing things now. They say having kids is a pain but hey I don't mind lol. Hate being lonely 80% of the time.

I'm sorry if this is long to read but I've never really told anyone my past in one take. Never really told anyone at all. If you've read everything thank you. It's nice to know someone's interested in my life &lt;3

P.S. I typed this after my mental breakdown lol. I didn't know where I wanted to go with this post but I just wanted to get everything out since I bottled up almost everything in my life. Thank you for reading :)

I’m chill with one of them, we get along fine, we used to go out a lot pre-covid, we had fun, we had some good emotional conversations over the years but I don’t think we have much in common and we can hardly talk about films or books or whatever. We were also brought up quite differently and she often makes comments about how I can’t understand her struggles because I’m more comfortable financially or getting annoyed that more guys look at me on a night out. Recently we had a fight because she said some ignorant things about covid and I don’t know it just made me frustrated that I had to be relatively nice to her stupid opinions just because she’s my friend. It felt unfair to myself.

The other person and I are each others’ longest friendship. We used to get along really well and because we met in our formative years we share quite a lot of memories and similarly have a lot of interests in common. The problem is for the past two years or so things have cooled down and although we still talk there isn’t much spark. I’m the one to message her first mostly and she barely tells me what’s up with her. She has some issues of her own which she doesn’t really open up about. I have been going through some things as well and unlike her I need her and I message her sometimes looking for comfort or advice but she usually leaves me on seen and only replies again when I write her about something funny or casual. 

I try to make things better in both of these friendships but I’m so tired cause I honestly think I deserve better. I had some attempts to end these friendships but then I would be completely alone and I’m already quite lonely, having barely left my house for the past few months. I have some other friends but they’re mostly uni friends and we usually talk about uni or casual stuff. 

I just wish I knew how to make friends and attract the right people for me. I really try and I don’t know why it’s just not happening. I’m desperate for deep, equal connections.

Looking back I was pretty dumb, thinking that people here actually want help. Most people in this sub just post how lonely they are, so others write ""same"" and they don't feel as worthless anymore. But once you tell people to change and actually be positive to strangers to get friends, you get downvoted and hated. Because people here don't wanna change. Most of them anyway(some actually try). They became addicted to their self pity and the pity of others as it's a momentarily relief of guilt and misery. But afterall this sub is nothing but an echo chamber of despair. 

Also, so many lonely people are here that should know how it feels like, yet 80% of the posts remain uncommented and with the one default upvote. Unless you write that you are a girl then every single member will answer you. So all I am trying to say is: maybe help each other before you expect help yourself.

945,letsrunaway99,1597997845,1,"They say adults don't really make friends and it seems true. I'm 21 and I think this is it for me.

I grew up surrounded by people, but I never grew up WITH anybody. I grew up alone in my own perspective. Everyone was growing up independent of me, only ever involving me at certain points but never connecting with me. There were no real connections. Everyone had their own dreams that never involved other people, least of all me.

When you miss out on that during your teen years in school, it's like it becomes permanent when you become an adult. You become estranged from everyone because you're so used to being alone. Everyone has their own agenda. You yourself are trapped in the vicious cycle of adulthood where you can't be free the way adolescents are free because you're part of the adult world where you have to be the worst thing. Mature. And being this kind of mature and surrounded by other adults means you won't get to know anyone.

You could have friends and a loving family and yet still feel lonely.
Because you might want a relationship with someone more than anything in the world... and yet time and time again you end up disappointed. It’s to the point where it feels like it’ll never happen.  

I’m 22 years old and all my attempts at long-term relationships have failed. Usually for the same reason 

- they’re just not that into me.

 I’ve even wondered if I’m cursed with singleness. I mean yes. It’s possible to be happy being single. But I’m not one of those people who can truly feel fulfilled that way. 

What’s worse is that most of the people around me all seem to have met someone. And... while I’m glad for them. It makes me sad because I’m unable to relate to their happiness. 

I’ve put myself out there. Many... many times. Nothings worked so far. 

And I gotta be honest. My self esteem has taken quite the dive because of it. I know my worth. The problem is no one else seems to 😔

I'm a stay at home Mom. I have a two year old and a 14 year old. I love and adore them so much...  
But I still feel lonely. My husband has a very demanding job, he works 12 hours and on his days off or even when he gets off work he goes to my brothers house or my brother in law's house and drinks. I feel like we are so distant. When we are at the house together he's playing videogames, working on his cars, going fishing and I'm at home with the kids. He has a lot of hobbies that keep him busy. I have a few. But mine keep me home. We sit next to each other and watch TV. That's how we spend time together, and it's usually something that the other one doesn't want to watch. It's usually me, so I'll sit next to him playing ACNH or on my phone. I'll mention at home dates but nothing ever happens. We don't talk. I don't talk to anyone but my 2yr old, my plants and our dogs.

I have an extremely toxic family, I've made excuses for them and just let them treat me like shit my whole life. I recently cut ties with them except my half sister and ex sister in law, and even with them I feel like a babysitter and distant relative. So my circle is extremely small. I have health issues and I didn't survived a lot of trauma just be treated like shit. I'm glad I don't have my family, I'm proud of my decision. But the divide in my family is my fault, says everybody.

 I feel all I have are my kids. Sometimes when I'm alone I feel so depressed and useless I think they'd be better off without me. 

I just feel so alone. I have no friends. Like seriously, no friends. I have no one in my life that I can talk to about how I feel without feeling guilty. Or without feeling judged. I'm sad most of the time and it's getting harder and harder to fake a smile. I do it for my kids. But it's getting exhausting.

Being social is deeply ingrained into us through evolution. In the past, if you weren't part of a social group, or were ostracized, it increased the likelihood of you dying. It'll be much more difficult for you to hunt alone, find a mate, sleep while feeling safe, etc. 

The give and take of being in a social group meant that you would help out where you can, and be relied upon. So to break it down, loneliness is a defensive response and absence of 3 human desires.

 1. The need to feel safe

2. The need to feel useful 

3. The need to feel like you belong

 If you could satisfy those desires, then if theory you should be able to cope better or alleviate your loneliness",lonely,What exactly makes you feel lonely?,2020-08-21 12:05:03

Even as a quiet introvert the lack of interaction is really starting to bother me. The closest thing I've had to social contact with my peers as of late is a text from a friend every few weeks or so. But that's really it.

I feel bad because I know that part of this is my own fault. I'm too anxious to initiate conversations and I sometimes forget to text people back on the occasions I do get a text, and then I feel too guilty to text them back and I start hating myself.

I didn't used to think that I would ever be lonely because I've always been a quiet person, but now I realize how valuable the (albeit shallow) social interaction I got in school was. I just feel so purposeless now. Really, the only thing keeping me somewhat functioning is academics, but I'm even loosing motivation for that because without anybody around me everything just seems meaningless.",lonely,I haven't had almost any social contact outside my family since the whole COVID situation,2020-08-21 10:01:15

Only just at the start of the summer holidays, she hardly talked to me at a party (while we planned it together).  It may sound too exaggerated, but it feels different, especially since we haven't talked for a month during the summer holidays while we normally talk daily. I thought she might want some time alone, but she often meets up with other mutual friends.  It also feels like she doesn't want to talk to me and I keep wondering what I've done that she doesn't want to deal with anymore.

My dad is in defence services so we moved across different states alot yet wherever I went I had so many genuine friends. But when I came to college, from day one I felt uncomfortable to settle in. Maybe it was a kind of culture shock, I didn't find myself ""cool"" enough and I still don't. I was pretty good at many things in my school but here in college there was not one thing that made me unique (it seemed everyone is better than me, be it in sports, intelligence, arts, fashion sense, beauty, financial condition, etc). My friends in hostel whom I spent most time with, even they left me several times when they went out for movie party etc.
I just keep pretending that I fine and I have put on this kinda weak personality who can't take a stand, who try to please everyone. I keep trying so many things, and ngl i have grown my certain skill sets in last one year, yet feel nothing is good enough. I am so confused in my life right now, there are so many conflicting thoughts thoughts that goes on my mind, its exhausting.
I talked about my insecurities with my school friends but they can't help in anyway cause we all live in different places (like we haven't met for years and virtually it's not the same). Also we all are leaving a very different life which makes it hard for us to truly understand each others problem.
Adding to all this I have been very shy around girls, so whenever I interact with one, I automatically go into defence mode ( like I become so closed to them that they have nothing to judge me) and hence any conversation is just a small talk and nothing more.

Thus, when my desire to interact with somebody gets to me (and it often does) it feels like my only options for this are the people on social media platforms with messaging like here, Facebook, even dating/hook-up sites like Tinder/Grindr, and then of course texting. Whether it's other folks having less time on their hands than I do,  or something perceived to be ""wrong"" with me, i don't often get replies from the people i reach out to, and for those to do respond and interact in some way don't do so for very long. in the usual back and forth of conversation, eventually they don't respond, and from there the likelihood of any reply drops dramatically and the conversation's chances of going anywhere are zero.   And so, time after time, i try to reach out and interact. And so on and so on.... and eventually, these attempts add up in your inbox. Well, for me, many of them are kept as long as they are in hopes there will be3 a reply, and  one day, staring right back art you are countless instances where somebody stopped responding, ""forgot"" , ""didnt care"", whatever face we put on it, here sit this accumulation of words, names, pictures, where the person stopped and the conversation died. As i look down, i see in EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. my message was the last one in the chain. Im not paranoid enough to say  they are against me, but my self esteem is low enough that i can very easily tell myself ""i dont matter enough"". I  get it, it's trivial, it's social media, its and that. But that pattern bothers me. I don't know how to make friends if i cant interact with people and have exchanges.

I have never been with a girl because I know I lack the charm and the social skills but I have always been trying to find someone. I would say I'm funny but it's mostly dark humour which apparently doesn't work with girls if you're not the best looking (my opinion). Ever since I moved here to Germany I have been feeling worse since I don't speak the language and even the tiny bit of social interaction I get to have is gone because of that. And I've been really depressed about it for months now. I have always understood that women needs to be attracted to someone inorder to get with them so I always try to be as decent and respect their choice but when you don't get any matches at all with social sites like tinder makes me feel worse about myself even more. In my opinion I'm not a bad looking guy, I sometimes look bad but everyone does. But this series of never having a match ever in personal profile made me depressed. So I thought maybe if they get to know my funny side they'll probably be attracted to me so I created fake profile which made girls notice. And I started getting their attention and I started getting 10's of matches atleast two matches daily. But even after they literally call me funny what I expect is to get more physical and get more close. So eventually I ask them for their social media and as soon as they see me, they apparently where not interested in any relationships or they're just there for their friend or worse, ghosting. I'm sick and tired of this and this is making me lose my sanity. I feel like I will lose my decency to be civil if this keeps on continuing. I have never called out anyone or made any ""nice_guy"" comments on them after they've said their disinterest.

1030,earthyash,1597923336,1,"Between working from home fulltime and remaining in isolation due to asthma as a preexiting health condition, I’m starting to slide back into depression. I’m an introvert and I handled things well back when this started but I had a roommate who also worked fulltime from home. My family would do weekly zoom calls and that helped. I’ve been on my lowest dose ever for my anxiety and depression and felt like I’d be okay.

It took me over 10 years and 6 tries but I’ve finally been able to buy my own home and am starting to get settled. Problem is this place is starting to feel like a prison. I rarely go out now that the big house projects are done; I used to go to the hardware store several times a week with a mask at least and there was some strange comfort even just being around other humans from a distance. 

I walk down to the group mailbox a few times a week. My neighbors are rarely out but at least they wave back when they drive or walk by. Before all this I had a myriad of hobbies in small groups or solo classes I took. I hardly had any friend face to face interaction since early March; I find it disconcerting close friends I’ve had for many years have dropped off and asides my parents and an aunt only one person has checked on me. My work doesn’t allow for video calls so I haven’t seen my coworkers since late February. It’s just hard, thought I would thrive during the pandemic but my depression and severe social disorder makes me do nothing but implode.

I have lots of creative interests but motivation to explore those, goals to learn a new language, somehow make the most of this new normal is challenging to say the least.

I’m in my early 30s, it’s not like I’m too old. I tend to shy away from social media and rarely read the news; I’m highly empathetic, absorb everything and am high sensory so it’s just too much. Feel like my unhappiness has grown. I feel like I could fall down the stairs or have some accident and no one would know for a while. 

It frustrates me that I’ve done all the right things - wear a mask in public, kept my distance, used hand sanitizer, not doing physical contact- yet at what cost? I’m doing this to more so keep others from potentially getting the virus and taking this seriously. I haven’t had a day off in well over a year-work is getting to me, I’m burned out and what high enthusiasm and hard work ethic I’ve always been known for has been declining.

I’m sorry this is so long but I’ve bottled this up for so long, all these emotions and nowhere to put them.  If you’ve made it to this point I’m grateful! There are so few kind people, I’m one of them who’s always putting others first but for once I had to put myself first for my sanity. Thanks for listening you beautiful soul.

I have a lot of friends, they come and go usually because i dont keep contact with them, even if they try to,its because i like spending time with them but i cant talk with them about the topics i really care about, if i start talking about death for example they start telling me that i should stop thingink about it because i will depress myself, but im perfectly talking about it i dont feel bad, maybe has something to do with all my family being dead already, its kinda part of my life really and in just trying to understand why it happened but they shut down the topic completely saying dont feel bad(which i am not, im not uncomfortable with it but they are so they try do dont think about it putting the blame on me making them feel sad, quite a projection they do with me) and we keep talking about meaningless stuff like games, university exams, going partying or stuff like that. And i just feel so alone in this, i know they love me and i love them too, thats why it hurts so much, seeing how they go through life blindfolded, looking for the next dopamine high, a videogame, a hookup, a party, everything except asking themselves why the fck do i run after these things like a donkey after its carrot, never being satisfied with the outcome. All the time thinking about getting laid but never actually doing it, they so desperate that they will sacrifice anything for a crumb of pu**y(they did it to me already and then they didnt get laid, fcking dumbasses i already told them they will not get anything but they just see the pu**y) thinking that it will change their life, that it will be the trampoline that will tell them what to do with their life. Dont get me wrong, i dont blame them for this, if i would be in their situation where the possibility of a hookup its like a miracle maybe i would behave like them too, but i dont have a problem in that regard, quite the contrary, its a everyday thing where everywhere i go girls see me in a sexual way, i try to talk to them about a deep topic i care about and they just shake it off and try to flirt with me, i feel so fkin offended by this, not by the fact that they wanna f**k, but because they dont appreciate my thoughts, my mind and thats where i want more satissfaction, if you dont like my mind you dont like me, go f**k somebody else. I never had a gf and i dont need one, i just want somebody who looks life in the eyes, with all the light and darkness, and then reflect it on theirselves and see that they are just the same, Good and bad, altruist and selfish. Everyone agrees when i say to them that because there is bad, there is also evil, because there is a villain there is a hero too, but no one wants to hear that because there is a hero, there has to be a villain, its the same fking thing but its to hard to accept that you create your own suffering by creating your desires, saying i like this, you automatically say at the same time i dont like the contrary of this i like, by establishing the condtitions for your success, you automatically established the conditions for failure. I try to explain this to People so fking hard but they dont see it, and it hurts so much, seeing how they suffer without knowing why, and going for the dopamine high that will take the suffering away, the suffering that they imposed on themselves, and they go round and round, complaining that they are not happy, trying to find the solution outwards, what the problem started inwards.

1044,mick207,1597912999,1,"Self confidence and overcoming your fear of rejection 

  We all want confidence. But really more often than not you just want to get something out of it. Whether that is to be liked or to impress others. The key is to be yourself. Stop comparing yourself and embrace yourself instead. All your flaws and all your problems and all the things that make you, you. This is the only way to truly become confident.
  It should not matter what anyone thinks of you. How you think of yourself is what you become. Do you talk down on yourself? Telling yourself you aren't good enough or attractive enough because your idea of what is ""perfect,"" doesn't match up to how your picture yourself. News flash you will never be ""perfect"" because it doesn't exist. Nobody is perfect. Even those you may dream about. Next time, talk up on yourself. Be your own pep rally. 
  You must stop trying to be like everyone else, people who you ""think"" are ""better"" than you. Your beliefs of how you should be are making you suffer by avoiding the reality of life. You see a ""goodlooking"" guy talking with some girls and immediately you think you should be like him. He's taller than you, more muscular, this puts you down. Why even compare? You're most likely not going to get any taller, and if you really want more muscles, you can get those, but why do you want them? To impress others. 
  The key to your own confidence is not in the gym, or the eyes of your peers. The key to your own confidence lies within your vision of yourself. If you spend too much time envisioning how you should be rather than living with who you are, you will never be happy, and you will never be confident, because you will never be good enough for yourself. Surrender and accept who you are, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. 
  When it comes to rejection, well you're just gonna have to get used to it. It's better to have tried and failed than to not have tried at all, because you'll never know how it would've gone. 

Step 1: Relax. True relaxation is living in the moment, void of any tension because you accept what is. Pain or pleasure, happiness or sadness. Both are temporary and will only stick around if you fuel them. 

Step 2: Understand who you are. You are only you, and nobody else. If you're going to make comparisons, make them to your past self. 

Step 3: Stop trying to impress people. Be yourself. If you're thinking too long for something to say, you're trying too hard.  Relax. 

Step 4: Do not hesitate. If you hesitate you will get scared. Just say hi, and go from there. Forget the stupid pickup lines, just be yourself.

Step 5: When you're talking to someone, you should not be thinking. If you're thinking about what to say, you're not listening, and if you're not listening, you aren't going to know what to say anyway. After all you saw this person and wanted to talk to them, right? Listening is key. Conversations can go a million ways and if you plan out a dialogue you will get stuck when they don't say what you thought they would. 



This is somewhat of a jumble but I hope you are able to take something from this. I'm still struggling myself but everyday gets easier. Keep your heads up and know you're not alone we are all dealing with something. But hey, that's what makes us unique, right? (:",lonely,Confidence comes from within.,2020-08-20 18:43:19

I have just been so good at cutting people off that I feel like I don't have any of my friends from before. The weird part is I am so aware of everything and I just feel so helpless. I cut off social media because it's so empty, maybe I did that because people living their lives better on it and it makes me feel insecure. Cutting off social media helped me a bit but now I have no messages in my inbox and the only notifications come from app updates and that makes me feel worse. It's felt like my suspicions are confirmed, you know. I feel like if I don't message certain friends first then there will just be no contact between us.

Today, I felt selfish for thinking so. I logged back in to social media annd tried to catch up with my friend but the response felt weak and one sided.

I don’t have family to fall on either, as my mother is more or less done with me emotionally. I have all these thoughts and slight interests and issues, but there’s no one to talk about them to. No one cares. I’ll never feel truly normal, or happy. No one will know or like the real me, either. It’s all pointless, and I wish I could just run away and restart my life, cause I’ve already lost.

1058,SkyAintTheLimitBro,1597901817,1,"Hello Friends!

I need your help in understanding why I'm ignored and seemingly despised by the people I meet. I apologize for the text wall.

Even typing ""friends"" made me feel weird. I say so because all my friends, without exception, fail to text me every now and then. I find myself reaching out to them way more often than they reach out to me.

I'm a dark skinned guy, well kempt (brush my teeth well, shower thrice a day). I'm eager to connect with people, but since high school, I've noticed that my peers don't seem to want to include me when a team has people of different races. I've noticed the same trend when another guy my race is in a poly-racial group - the dude is sorta *there, y*ou know? Just hangin' around, not involved in the group project. No one asks him his opinion, and he must barge in to make himself heard, at which point they look at him like he's an alien who's rudely interrupted their convo. I've felt the same. It was even more humiliating when a kid two years younger than me told me to shut up and that no one cared about what I had to say. :/ idk why lol, was too afraid to ask and humiliate myself further, in front of five other kids.

Not trying to play the race card to gain sympathy, but my cousin, who's the same race, got picked on at the same hs. They'd say where's X? All I can see is his shadow! My cousin X has darker skin than me... And mind you, this was the school year 2017-2018.

I'm seriously confused as to why people seem to hate conversing with me. My accent is just like theirs too, so it can't be a language barrier. I'm friendly, although I do make sex jokes from time to time, because I think it'll make people like me more.

Regarding culture, I don't like subscribing to the new gangsta/slang/pop culture all that much. It seems way too haughty to me. Maybe that's why they can't relate? I don't use a lotta slang/hand signs etc.

 I also don't use Instagram/FaceBook/Snapchat/Twitter/TikTok. I don't even have accounts. 

Apparel: I think I need to say that I don't spend a lot of my parents' money on clothes. I own a **single** pair of running shoes, and a **couple** shorts and **few** shirts, and a **couple** jackets. I think it might be this one, because a friend called me a cheap-ass once for wearing my favorite yellow hoodie thrice the same week. 

Tech: I don't have the Airpods or Apple Watch or the latest iPhone. Didn't have a phone in high school. I have the 8 plus, a 15"" MBP bought in 2018, and Solo3 wireless headphones. 

**Consequences:** Because of the constant ignorance, I tend to suppress my eagerness to connect and be part of the group. Even when I approach someone to converse with them, I lose all my confidence and what comes out is an embarrassing stammer. Obviously, they think I'm weird, and turn to the person next to them to converse with them instead. When I'm at home, I *rarely* stammer. I feel so fucking embarrassed. I'm also a little emotional for a guy. I don't like being an arrogant alpha male type. Heck, I'm crying right now as I write this post.

I feel like everyone else's having fun in college, except me. Even at a nearby church, everyone's paired up, boyfriend-girlfriend. It felt really awkward being alone in my pew. I took the bus there, but I couldn't bear being seen by everyone else at church. So as soon as mass was over, despite the hard rain, I ran toward the bus stop to beat them to it. Unfortunately, my plan didn't work. I saw the bus approach, and knew that I couldn't bear to ride the bus with them. So I started running away at night in the rain, without an umbrella, despite my fellow church-goers calling after me saying, ""Hey wait! The bus is here!"" I ran all the way home to my dorm like a wimp. I can't ever show my face there again. 

Can anyone else relate? Thanks so much for taking time to read this :) God Bless.",lonely,"Is something wrong with me, or am I overthinking things? Ignored.",2020-08-20 15:36:57

1118,lord_of_lighters,1597866294,1,"I’m 25 f and a teacher. Today I was placed at the highschool with the freshman and the kids were great. Today was pretty good. 

Until lunch. 

I went to the teachers lounge for 5 minutes at most to heat up my lunch and pee. Two of my coworkers were absolutely *bitching* about their husband getting their doctorates. This wasn’t venting of “oh I’m so stressed since he’s in school and we were working full time.” No, that’s understandable. One coworker said, and I quote, “idiot shit husband.” Repeatedly. In the 5 minutes I was in there. They talked about how their husbands were too emotional and slacking. “Dumbass.” “Lazy.” It went on and on. 

I’ve posted several times that my cheating alcoholic ex fiancé left me the moment something new and shiny came a long. I’ve also struggled with PCOS for years and haven’t had a period since April. It’s not been an easy year. 

Before I say this I hardly ever cry. I didn’t cry when my ex abandoned me or cheated twice. I didn’t cry when I cancelled all the things I was looking forward too about my future with him. I didn’t cry on the days when I wanted to talk to him but realized he left. I haven’t cried on the lonely nights where it hurts so bad to be alone and I just want to be held. 

Today, I went back to my room and broke down. 

I could not imagine having new healthy babies, with hard working men who want to further their education and talking shit about them to whoever would listen. 

I would love to have what they have and could not understand how someone could be so ungrateful. It took everything in me to not say, “well at least they’re not cheating drunks like my ex was.” I would love to have what they have and was angry they don’t understand how blessed they are. 

I cried because, even though this is an  illogical feeling, I felt my nose was rubbed in how lonely I am.

My only real joy at the moment is going out eating and clothes shopping, but it's starting to get embarrassing because everyone else eats and walks around with at least one other person. It's embarrassing having to say ""Table for one"" in a cafe full of people all eating, talking and laughing together.

It's almost like I've been singled out in life; like I'm some sort of subhuman unworthy of close human contact. It's got to the point where I can't even imagine what it must be like to call up an actual living person and say ""Hey you wanna get some food?"" and actually do it. And actually have conversations with that person. And actually laugh with that person. To share some experience with that person.

I was gonna go out today, but... what's the point. It's embarrassing. I'm tired of seeing whole gangs of friends hanging out and having fun. Seeing loved-up couples is starting to make me sick. Even people who are outright nasty have folk around them for crying out loud! What's so wrong about me? Why am I alone?

1142,Snake_Eyes707,1597828832,1,"I have friends and me and my family are close but I know that deep inside I feel lonely and really empty. It's just a feeling that I can't really shake off. You guys might think like, ""This dude has friends and all, how can he still feel lonely?"". I can assure you that it still happen, to me at least.

I'm close with my friends, like really close. It's not just 2-3 people, it's at least 13-15 people and we all have a group chat that has like 150+ messages per hour at least. We talked a lot and honestly, it was always fun. I'm not trying to flex or anything but if any of you guys actually felt offended, I'm really sorry. Anyways, they always invited me for activities and stuff and never left me out of anything before. They even told me that they liked me and I'm the only one to cause less problems between all of us. I was glad to be told about that, considering my past.

Even with all this, why do I still feel lonely? I don't really get it but it really hurts, it's like that you've been given everything but you're still not happy. I may sound needy but I refuse to believe I am. I know myself pretty damn well, afterall, everytime something bad happens or if I got into trouble, I only have myself to settle it. I tend to keep stuff to myself, not even my friends or family knows if I got myself in trouble.

I don't openly share about myself to my friends unless they ask me to, which they don't if you were wondering. It's safe to say at this point that I know more about my friends than they do about me. I don't really share my problems with them because I think it's unnecessary. I don't mind when they share theirs though. But the point is that I'm always the one that has to tell myself that ""everything is gonna be fine"" even if it's not. And to be honest, I'm really tired and sick of doing that. I want someone to do that for me instead.

I always come out as the ""happy"" and ""funny"" guy to my friends. And if I were to suddenly approach them to tell that I have problems and I need them to comfort me would really hurt my ego. Sorry, I'm just that type of guy.  So in the end, I'm really just hurting and suffering by myself.

I've never been in a relationship in my whole life (21 years) nor have I even made a move on anyone before or vice versa. I've never bother much about being in a relationship. But everytime I see a couple that's just minding their own business, I feel pain in my chest, like my whole chest tightens. A heartache. I dunno, maybe I'm just jealous. ""But you said that you don't really care about being in a relationship"". I know, I said that, but maybe I really do care after all. I'm just really confused and as days passed on, it feels like I don't understand myself anymore, what I want, what I need.

I tend to avoid those kinds of romantic shows or movies that have like cute couple things or whatsoever cause when I saw one, it really reminds me how miserable I am. It really hurts a lot. And I also cry a lot by myself these past few years. Nobody knows about this though, my friends have never even saw me being sad or emotional before too. And when I cry, I cry for hours, contemplating how lonely and miserable I feel. I just want someone to care about me.

In the end, I just want someone that I could rely on, worry for me, care for me. One that I could be vulnerable around and truly be myself. Someone that would love me more than I could for myself. But that's just wishful thinking. I had accepted that I might or will die alone, unloved. Maybe I just crave for affection and love, to be loved. I've never experienced any love (other than family of course) before, so I really wonder if it will make all of this pain go away and be happy once more. And to be honest with you guys, I really don't want to die alone. I just really feel lonely, empty and miserable inside.

Sorry if this was too long, I just really need to let it all out. I've never told about this to anyone before except for you guys of course. And I'm sorry if I've missed a few words cause I tend to do that while typing. I really appreciate you guys for reading this though. Thank you.",lonely,"I have friends and my relationship with my family is good but deep inside, I still feel super lonely and empty",2020-08-19 19:20:32
1143,kabe98uk,1597827617,1,"I dont really expect anyone to read all this or even care but I thought I'd share. This is my story of how I went from having a good social life to a depressed and socially isolated recluse. This is probably going to be a long one, abit of a life story if you will, so if you can actually be bothered to read it all then great. I'm 21(m) 22 in October. As you can probably tell by my username I'm from the UK (England specifically) I came from a working class background but once I was about 7 or 8 became more lower middle class because my parents managed to get better jobs. I have Aspergers syndrome which wasnt diagnosed until I was 16. Its caused me some problems in life, what used to be mild anxiety (ill come back to that) but I still managed to get on with it. I live in a rough town so I've seen a lot growing up. I went to quite bad schools so didnt really get the best of educations and I used to disappear from classes quite a bit, even in primary school (what any americans reading this would call elementary school) I'm not a virgin in any way I used to have an active sex life, I lost my virginity age 14, I've had numerous girlfriends, one night stands and sex with girls at parties etc, but I'll get back to girls and sex later in this story. I was an average  student in high school age 11-13 then at 14 my friends and I all got heavily into weed and other drugs, but mainly weed. All we wanted to do was skip classes and go smoke weed. I had to steal and sell drugs in order to fund my drug habits but life was good, me and my friends were having fun smoking weed, chasing girls, I took up boxing and weightlifting in my spare time I had quite a good physique, I felt healthy and full of life. My first ""proper"" girlfriend at age 14 who I lost my virginity to was a girl I met on holiday  and we hit it off, had sex a few times, she gave me blow jobs and stuff, we decided to get in a relationship but after the holiday finished it didnt last long. A couple of months. She actually died 2 years ago, we hadn't spoken in a while. I didn't go to her funeral but I still felt saddened by her death. Anyway after I broke up with her I found a new girlfriend who at first seemed like a nice, sweet kinda quiet girl, exactly my type. But little did I know this girl would go on to cause me hell. She'd never had a full on relationship was still a virgin and I took it so she became quite attached. Her family were really rough, all her family sold drugs even here grandmother sold ketamine. Her grandmother used rob weed of a local dealer to give to me she liked me she was always kind to me. My girlfriends step dad was also a pretty cool guy I used to go round the house to smoke weed with him and listen to his stories about prison and stuff like that. The relationship with this girl lasted nearly 2 years from 14-16. But as time went by she got increasingly controlling and crazy. We leave school age 16 here in the uk. And after I left I got a job pretty much straight away working in a warehouse. I didnt enjoy it much but it was money and it felt better morally than stealing to fund my weed addiction. My girlfriend used to try all kind of tactics to get me out of work because she was convinced I was going to find another girl there. She tried to stop me from seeing my friends which frustrated them and they distanced themselves from me. But I stayed with her because I still liked her. Anyway this all came to climax when I found out shed slept with a friend of mine, not a close friend who I went school with but it still infuriated me. I couldn't believe she was always so controlling and paranoid about me cheating then to go and do it herself. I've never been so angry. I dumped her straight away. Around this time I also got told i was probably going to get fired from my job so I quit and havnt worked since. I was in a really bad place. By this point I'd long given up boxing and weightlifting and was out of shape. I took up weightlifting again and rebuilt a good physique and my mental health improved. I started going to wild parties and nightclubs with my friends taking cocaine and MDMA, having sex with girls. One night stands. Then one night at a nightclub I bumped into the guy who slept with my ex. I beat the shit out of him, got arrested the next morning and there was a big court case. In the end I narrowly avoided prison, luckily I was 17, had I been 18 they said i would have gone to prison. I  had to perform community service and report to a youth offending officer once a week. It wasnt that bad. During this time I found another girlfriend. Again she seemed like a nice, quiet girl, the kind I like. I made the same mistake again. The relationship was great at first. This girl compared to the last girlfriend was much less clingy and her family were quite wealthy. I later found out her dad was a dodgy scrap dealer who was friends with world champion boxer Tyson Fury. Like I said the relationship was great at first we stayed at posh hotels and took a trip to Amsterdam for my 18th birthday. My source of income at this point had gone back to selling drugs and claiming benefits ( I think americans call it welfare but I'm not sure) then the relationship started to sour we argued alot. She broke up with me I was pretty gutted but accepted it and went back to sleeping with girls at parties again. When my ex found out she got jelous and begged for me back, I accepted and we gave it another go but it only lasted about another month then we ended it on mutual terms. Now this is the turning point in my life where things really started to go wrong. I was depressed another relationship had failed once again. I tried meeting other girls but not much success. I decided to give college a go and enrolled in an electrical installation course. My time at college lasted a mere 3 weeks, because what had always been mild anxiety was now becoming more severe. I became more and more anxious which in turn caused increasing depression. I forgot to mention that I'd been off and on anti depressants since I was 13 due to always suffering mild depression (nothing to serious) but it was at this point starting to get quite bad. I then had a heated argument with 2 of my close friends for causing a mess in my back garden (yard for americans) I shouted at them, kicked them out and didnt speak to them for months. I've always had quite a bad temper. I then stopped speaking to all of my friends apart from 2 because I knew they didnt hang around with the friends I fell out with. But of the only 2 friends I carried on seeing were kind of recluses themselves. My anxiety began to go threw the roof and I now found it difficult to even hold a conversation, even with family or friends. I had to give up weed a couple of months ago, which used to be a favourite past time of mine. Because it was causing me to have panic attacks. This inability to hold a proper conversation caused my anxiety and depression to increase more and more and more. I've  ended up a complete mess. I developed a bad habit of staying awake all night and sleeping through the day which I still struggle with now. I stayed in my room 90% of the time. I still do. I now dont speak to most of my family because they think I've gone really weird and make snide comments. I've not seen majority of my family since my grandads funeral last October. I've spoke to and seen my friends increasingly less and less because they too think I've gone weird. And my anxiety just cant cope with the social interactions. I've gone from being good with women to being unable to speak to them. I've now not had sex in nearly 2 years and that was with prostitutes in amsterdam. I feel depressed all the time from the moment I wake up until I go to bed. I feel suicidal regularly and I honestly cant belive my life has ended up this way. It doesnt seem real. It feels like a bad dream I cant wake up from. I think having everything good in my life ripped away from me is the hardest part. I remember how it was to have a good social life, and living like this doesnt even compare. It's awful. Well if you've read this far then congratulations and thank you, because this has ended up being alot longer than I imagined. I'm still in constant disbelief of the path my lifes taken. I hope to somehow, someday turn things around because I'm not enjoying living like this. I've now been a total recluse for 2½ years and I dont know how or when it's going to end...",lonely,How I went from having a good social life to being a recluse,2020-08-19 19:00:17

I want to sincerely give up on maintaining or making new relationships/friendships. This isn’t out of frustration or anger. Truthfully, I am tired. I have spent so much of my time and energy trying to maintain friendships and relationships. However, everyone ends up leaving me anyways. This has happened across my lifetime in different phases of who I am. I’m not mad at the people who left me. I understand, I really do. You know, people move on and people outgrow other people. I understand that idea. However, for some reason, people tend to outgrow me. I see all my past friends still hanging out and all, even after years. All my old friend groups still being friend groups, just without me. That’s fine. Honestly, I get it. I legitimately am a boring person, there is absolutely nothing special or significant about me. You know how when you think about a person, and there is always something that sticks out about them? Well, you really can’t do that to me, because there is honestly nothing, which is fine. I bring in zero substance and/or difference into people’s lives. People forget me all the time, and for a while, it hurts, but now I just am used to it. Like, my attitude is like “yeah, I get it.” Right now, all I can think about is the future I want which is to just be by myself. I dream of just working and going into an empty home, maybe some cats.

1155,WizardryWug,1597819715,1,"Letting you know in advance, this is a bit emotional.

I've never gone into this but naturally understand demi and aligned with it my entire life

Personally I don't like looking into the natures of this sort of thing and I especially don't tell anyone about how I am. I don't know why but it takes away my attraction for someone when I explain then they know even a little and tell me after I've explained. It's like they have to get it themselves in order for me to feel anything further. I'm annoyed at myself for it more than anything. I'm concerned enough to seek others thoughts.

I've had a girl actually push to befriend me, sit next to me and just be in my presence every time we were in the same place. Only now that I'm no longer there that I realise how much she liked me while I did nothing but reply and smile. She was really sweet, nice and good looking and asked my friend if she could claim me while in front of me which I found hilarious yet only laughed a little. This has happened throughout my life, I don't want to change I just want it to you know, work. How am I supposed to tell someone that I like how they attain my nature through trial and error, being near me, when they are so afraid of getting it wrong or trying and that a big part of it is me not telling them. I like when they get it wrong just as much as when they don't and when I'm comfortable I make sure it's worth it or I get incredibly upset with myself for an amount of time which seems never ending.

If I do develop an attraction it is so strong that I physically hurt when it doesn't work out. I'll go to great lengths to return how good they made me feel.

So I don't know what I am really supposed to do. It sucks more than anything now as I actually have no one in my life. I'm used to it, I've only had one serious relationship. I've opened up a lot in hopes to make a friend but it isn't easy unless they have the same interests and we are progressing together on a hobby/life-goal or just some fun activity where the activity is the main focus. Dare they try to get to know me and I freak out running thoughts into the future and then all the hurt from how complicatedly not complicated I am and have been. I'm trying to negate it by looking back to how calm and collected I used to be. I'm spending a lot of time in the past, I don't have a great one. Great family, some amazing times, some things to confidently brag about and people, just a lot of bad stuff as well making me not want to think back. When someone has managed to get passed my freak out for a while then and only then am I able to get seriously hurt. I've got to make some new great things but it's so difficult when my side is so empty now. I miss my friend.

Each day the news on his condition just gets worse. And I don't really have a social life right now. Haven't for a while because of the health stuff. There's never a great time to find out your dad is on his way out,  and this is certainly no exception. Anyway.



He went into an ICU several days ago due to cardiac arrest and a flesh eating bacteria in a wound on his arm. Today he *finally* had an MRI done and there's irreversible brain damage. He's got 6 kids, only 4 of us have really been involved with the decision. One is a minor, the 6th just got out of prison and never cared for the man anyway.


Personally, I'm holding up okay regarding the news about tomorrow. I'm feeling sad, sure, but he and I haven't been close in a few years and I accepted months ago that I was never getting back the father that I was tight with for the first 25 years of my life. (33 now.) It sucks and I'm going to miss him terribly, but I have also *already* been missing him for a long time. I guess I've done my grieving already. I know though, that death can have unpredictable effect so I'm aware that maybe in the future I could break down and sob my guts out. I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.


For now, I'm mainly concerned about my 2 younger siblings. Sister (22) and brother (17). They and their mom (my step mom, and dad's 2nd ex wife) are taking it extremely hard. My sister is going to fly to see him tomorrow. She's the closest to him geographically and the only one with the financial means to get there quickly. She's been trying to work with the hospital to be allowed into the ICU to see him because of COVID and she'll get results from a test tomorrow. Fingers crossed it's negative ha!

I'm scared for her having to go in their alone, and they're not giving her very long to visit with him. We talked yesterday and she already expressed being nervous about going alone, especially because she hardly has any experience with death. One of the closest experiences she's had was actually with me a few years ago. I, weirdly enough, contracted a flesh eating virus in a wound, thousands of miles away from where my dad caught is.

Anyway, the whole family was terrified for months wondering if I'd pull through. Almost 4 years later and as stated above, at last the end is in sight on my road to full recovery. That was horrible enough for her, and now she's faced with this. She debated whether there was any point, seeing as she'll have less than an hour with him, and it's pretty likely he won't even know  she's there. Ultimately she decided to go through with it before they take him off life support though. I'm hoping she doesn't fall apart, at least not til she gets back home to her boyfriend.

And our little brother. He's also had a complicated relationshipwith our dad. I was surprised, and truthfully a little relieved, that he had an emotional reaction upon finding out dad went into the ICU. I was concerned he would shrug it off and try to hide his reaction. He (my brother) and I haven't been all that close recently, but that's only due to geography and my health. He was a bit young when I first developed my issues and his mom chose not to burden him with hearing much. I've wanted to reconnect with him like we did when he was little, it just hasn't happened yet, primarily because I've had some serious mental issues and have been a shite brother. I took the opportunity to reach out to him with everything going on with dad. I figured we could catch up, I could let him know everything  that's happened with me, as well as talk him through what's going on with dad. He texted me and said he'd try calling me tonight if he had time after work. And it feels like a lot of pressure. I figured he'd agree to talk and we'd do it in a few days. And now I'm stressed because what if it doesn't go the way I'm hoping? What if I say the wrong thing about dad, and it gets weird? I get nervous super easily these days. Recently I was in cellphone store and it got crowded out of nowhere and I had a full on panic attack. And honestly I've been afraid to talk to my brother because I barely know him anymore and I'm so incredibly self conscious. Part of the family was planning to have a little reunion in March, he didn't know I'd be there and I planned on surprising him with a weekend in a hotel in Vegas, since he lives right near there.

And then stupid COVID came and ruined billions of people's plans.

Hello folks!

My mental health at the very moment is in ruins and I really need help... let me elaborate a little.

I had a huge fight with a close friend of mine yesterday (we'll call him A) over a really silly topic, and it ended with him using homophobic/transphobic slurs against me (I'm pan and nonbinary). I was really hurt and told him that I'm gonna have to cut him out of my life, at least for now... He kept on repeating them over and over, and eventually blocked me.

My bigger and much more important issue is when I told my best friend (we'll call him Y) what A did, he was mad at him but then started ignoring me.. I tried texting/calling Y to vent a little, but he just he was busy all day and night, and it's making me worried he's gonna pick A's side... This isn't like Y, I've been trying to get in touch since yesterday but he keeps on ignoring me.

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm really scared and anxious, Y is my best/closest friend, and my only true friend. I really don't want to lose him.

*sigh* I give up..

I have no one else to talk to..",lonely,Scared of losing my best friend,2020-08-19 14:42:41
1170,annonymous_s,1597811859,1,"

I’m going to start this off by saying that it’s hard for me to be vulnerable around people. I think it’s mainly because don’t want anyone to think I’m “weak” (not sure if that’s the right word). Because of this I often feel that I don’t open up to people/ no one knows the real me.

The real me is sad a lot of the time because she feels she doesn’t have anyone to really trust or rely on because no one knows who she really is. 

Last summer is when I started to realize how alone I was. During school I had people to talk to, people to eat lunch with, to study with, and outside of school I was “too busy” to hang out with people. But then summer hit and I spent my days inside, alone. I told myself I liked it that way, that I was an introvert. I was lying. I genuinely felt like no one wanted to hang out with me and I didn’t make the effort for fear of rejection.

Throughout that school year I stopped “bouncing between friend groups”. I took on my fear of rejection and my fear of not having a back up plan and stuck with one group. And for a while I was pretty stable. Sure, every now and then I would question if they actually liked me or not, if I meant as much to them as they did to me. Sadly, a lot of my mental health has to do with how much other people value me. When I feel unwanted, I feel sad. Today, I feel sad.

Today was the “last day of summer” because school begins tomorrow. Looking back on my summer, I realize I didn’t do too much. It’s been a step up from last year, I have 3-4 friends I feel comfortable asking to hang out. But today, a few of my friends hung out without me and lied about it. Which really shouldn’t bother me, they probably didn’t mean anything by it and I should be tougher than that. But everyone is posting on instagram about their amazing summers, and I can’t even remember one above average thing I did.

It’s been a while since I posted on here because I have been doing better socially and emotionally. I took some steps back today but hopefully I’ll recover. If anyone is reading this (though they probably aren’t because this is very long) and wants to talk/give advice/listen, I’m down for whatever. Thanks for reading.

I lived in a home where my parents fought everyday and felt like an only neglected kid. I vividly remember thinking once about when the last time my parents didn’t fight and i couldn’t think of a recent day. When they didn’t fight, they weren’t talking. Living in the same house for months not talking only staying together for the sake of me. Yet I felt so alone and this was about 7 years ago. I’ve always felt closed and alone. I’ve dated a couple girls who I know everything about but they know nothing about me. I don’t want to open up about anything, i don’t enjoy that feeling of telling people about my life. I’m 22 now and I still feel so alone. I barely talk to any girls ever and when I do I just say fuck it. But deep down all i want is someone in my life who really cares about me, someone who i can open my mind and heart to but it seems like everyone’s busy or already in a relationship.

Why can’t I stop obsessing about being single? Well it’s in our DNA. Duh.
Humans need to attract other humans to reproduce, so we have hormones that make us focus on that. 

This is obviously true. So why do ugly people exist? If we’re supposed to reproduce why is there such a thing as ugly people? I so badly want to accept that I’m not meant to date someone. I just didn’t make the cut in the looks department. But no matter how hard I focus on other important things in my life, I’m always sucked back into doing everything possible to make myself more attractive so that I’m no longer single.

It was raining yesterday at school, I was wearing a rain jacket and was about to go outside to go another building. But then she called out to me as I was opening the door and asked if we could share the raincoat. I said yeah, and I unzipped it and we held it over ourselves so our heads were covered, we went out into the rain and she started joking about ‘who needs umbrellas’ and for the first time this year, I smiled.

We made it to the building and she said bye and left. I know this seems good and all, but it hurts me since she is already in a relationship and that friend group I mentioned excludes me and I’m spending my last year of high school alone because of that.
I would try to make new friends but my good ol’ mental health problems stop that from happening.

I dated this girl for about 6 months and became so invested with her, we did everything together and it was great, she even supported my dream of playing college soccer, and hopefully pro.We went to church together, the beach, dates of all kinds, we even took the ACT on the same day in the same school. I told her things, I wouldn’t even tell my therapist.I gave up everything for this girl, I gave up relationships, friendships, time, money, and a lot of effort. Most importantly and my biggest regret, I gave up every offer/scholarship I had for college for her. I decided it would be better for me to stay closer to her since I was a senior and she was a junior.  I never told her because I didn’t think twice about it, she was my everything. Well shortly after emailing the schools and coaches, She broke up with me and nothing has been the same since. She said I was “too good for her”, and that I have “too many issues” too much for her to deal with because of my past and mental disorder.
She took most of  my friends away from me and the ones that are left are great and I love them,but they’ve moved on from me, they got married or moved away..Everyone has told me to move on but it’s so hard, I know it was only 10 months but I felt like it would last a lifetime, it’s hard moving on when you don’t know how to.She took everything from me, and I let her because I was in love.
Fast forward a year later(now) she committed to play soccer and has moved on from me. I ran into her at a restaurant and she pretended she didn’t know me. I can't even begin to describe the pain in my heart. I have nothing now, no friends that care, my parents don’t care, all the people I was close with, moved away for college. 
So now I’m stuck in my small town with nothing to do, no one to talk to/hangout with.No texts, no snaps, no calls, nothing. Some days I don’t even want to get up and wish that I never woke up. I work, go to community college, workout, and go to church, but none of it feels the same without her or my friends. I don’t play soccer anymore, all my offers expired. I tried reaching out to a few but nothing came of it. 
I’ve given up on everything because of one stupid heartbreak. I hate being this lonely. I don’t even cry anymore. It’s just pain in my heart. I try not to use any social media often because I get so upset and enraged that everyone got to go out and experience life, not held back by such pathetic things as heartbreak. I can’t even begin to describe the feeling when I see her stories or posts or people I used to be friends with.

I am born with spastic diplegia, which is a form of cerebral palsy. I’ve always had a hard time to socialize with other people and I always thought people didn’t want to talk to me because I have cerebral palsy. That’s until 3 years ago when I realised it has nothing to do with cerebral palsy. I’m just so socially ankward and so boring. 

Also, I am jealous of my 18 y/o sister. She is so mature for her age, she has good grades, she has her driver’s liscence, a car, plenty of good friends and a boyfriend. I should be happy for her but it makes me so mad that she gets to have everything and I have nothing. Because of this, we have not spoke to each other in years. To make it easier for her since she takes a lot of space, I also stopped being close to my cousins (18,16 and 13). In other words, I kinda erased myself from the family.

When universities in Canada announced online classes for the rest of the semester in March this year, myself and another friend returned home while one remained in the country. I returned to Kenya and my other friend returned home to Germany. At first things were ok, it was nice to be back home and we kept in touch frequently by gaming together or just video calling each other. Over time however it slowly progressed to a point where I would reach out to them and would get a response a couple of days later. This would make me feel a bit upset but I understood that they're probably occupied with other things. When it was my birthday the friend in Canada forgot about it, which bummed me out quite a bit. 

At the moment it's now reached a point where they either don't respond or acknowledge my messages. I'll get a random snap of the floor or sky every now and then but it's as though any effort I've made to strike up a conversation has gone unnoticed and fallen on deaf ears. I would really appreciate some advice on what exactly to do about this, I tried bringing it up with them but they mentioned that they have been busy at home and don't check Instagram. I then asked if whatsapp would be better to which they said yes, but there was no difference. I don't know why things are like this, from a point where we considered each other family to a point where I feel like I'm being treated as a complete stranger. The signals are very mixed, and I don't know whether I should try and confront them about it or just move on. I can't exactly make friends here in Kenya and they will be returning to online studying in Canada. I'm worried that missing a semester of being there will create a further rift and I'll have to completely start over with making new friends.

or if someone is sitting near the nurse, i just  lock myself in a toilet until the break ends. my sanity is slowly decreasing. every day is worse than other. every day i walk by myself and see everyone hanging out. im the only loser in school that has no friends. they all go and eat outsude, talk and have  a good time. what i do is sit bymyself watching youtube and holding in tears and wondering where it all gone wrong.

ive heard some advice to dealing with no friends is 'jUst g0 oUt aNd tAlK to pEoplE' well who the fuck will i do it with ? i literly have 0 people i can talk to irl. i guess i don't belong here. maybe i deserve this. after all, i used to be that fat kid who fighted everyone. i still fucking regret that. at least when i was a dickhead (i may still be, idk but last 1 year i havent been in any fight) i had some social skills and 1 friend. now nothing.

i try to tell myself this all is pointless and this people wont mean anything after 2 years. but i can't lie to myself, i do care. i wish i got invited to parties, but then the i realized.  i deserve this because im the most boring person ever. i have no personality and i come off as cold to people even tho i don't want. ive heard a classmate  say about me 'that guy pretends to be depressed'. even tho i never said i had depression and im not even diagnosed with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

back to the point, i literately am so awkward that i can't even make proper eye contact . i try to but thougts tell me 'what if you come off as staring in a creepy way' . i hate my stupid brain.  when i think about other classmates i think how they all have traits, one is funny,one is kind, one is smart, one is strong and likes sports. but me... i got nothing. im just a skinny loser who plays video games and knows a little about many things. im not smart, im dumb. my ego tells me im smart but i know that im dumb, im boring and not funny. i used to make people laugh but i relized they were laughing at me,not with me. then i changed my joke style and it worked but then idk what happend and i lost the ability to make jokes. i did one yesterday and got the class laughing. best feeling in a while , however i used to make jokes everyday, now i do one every few months. i lost that. 

&amp;#x200B;

even when im doing my favorite hobbies i can't stop thinking about how lonely i am. when i turn on doom i turn it off. i just dont feel it. i love minecraft but i try to play it and i can't.

even working out isn't enjoyable. i skipped legday yesterday and feel shit.  i could have made progress in my leg but i let them get fatter.

however  ive been lately into healthy coocking and it's my new escape from realitty.  but ultimatly, no matter how much my mom loves my food. i got F in coocking and i probably sucks. and eating in a calories surplus without working out will make me fat. i need to work out but im not feeling it. im still gonna be a skinny loser even if i go up in weight. i fucking hate my visible back bones and rib cage.

no matter what i do, its in the back of my mind, mostly at school. i have no friends will probably be lonely all my life. i want to imrpove but i cant. whats even the point of this post ? sorry if it was poorly structured and semi long. i just wanna get this off my chest.",lonely,how long can i take it ? im too fucking weak. i wish this suffering ends.,2020-08-19 02:29:50

1234,tkeser4,1597747865,1,"""The truth is, you cannot love yourself unless you have been loved and are loved. The capacity for love cannot be built in isolation."" - Bruce D. Perry

I have struggled with social connections for a while now. I don't think I have any issues that make me unwanted as a few people that I do know have told me I don't and there never were any problems there. The thing is that I long for a deep connection with someone. I get that you have to have something else going on in your life and you have to work on yourself and that is what I am doing. However, in todays world, most people don't want a deep, meaningful connection with someone. All they want is to hook up with the most attractive person they can, be with them for a month or two and then replace them like a damn sock.


This kind of behavior makes me, and I'm sure many others, pretty depressed about everything. Don't we have what it takes to at least have a chance at experiencing true connection? There are so many people, like myself, that would love to commit to a meaningful relationship but it is as if that ain't what is ""trending"" today.


Because of my approach to friendships and relationships which is very serious I have never probably been able to socialize in a healthy way and it feels like I am stunted in some way because of it.


As much as I tell myself that many people or even most are lonely in someway and long for love, all I see are blissfully ignorant people that just get so much attention and love it is insane. And then there is always that famous line ""You have to love yourself first"". That is one of the most bs things ever. Lonely people cannot invent love out of nowhere, it has to be given first so that as a human you understand that you are worthy.

1239,Asturias369,1597742760,1,"Greetings everyone,  


I was wondering if there would be others like me around here or that something is 'wrong' with me.  
After accepting the 'fact' that I would probably be alone for the rest of my life, things started to changed internaly. I find it no problem anymore to go somewhere alone, like the cinema for example.  


I am using the free space of time and energy now for gym and setting up my own (e-)commerce business(es). Self development books/podcasts really help, philosophy on YT as well. There are actually quite some things someone can do when one side of live ( social part ) falls out, some much time/energy to invest in something else ( like career for example ). Perhaps I am looking for distractions, but most of the time I can just BE. Do what I want, whenever I want and how I want.  


After accepting the lone wolf that lurks around me, I began seeing thing differently from the rest...  
It is weird, but life can be beautiful, even when you are alone. Perhaps I'm just crazy, I have sort of internal conversation like ""oh, that part of the movie was great, but the way he pulled that stunt was even more amazing. So...what should I do now, what do I want do now? Let's go grab a beer in a random local pub. etc etc"".  


I am not sure why I am sharing this, perhaps it's beceause I see so much pain and negativity.  
Loneliness can drain someone energy and cause depression etc, but perhaps people that are lonely might now think of it as a moment/chance to work on themselves a bit without any outside interfences? I just hope someone out there might feel inspired and try to do something with their precious time versus feeling down...  


Also, been a while since I begun to walk this path of the lone wolf....I even wonder if I could even connect to people noweday's ( since I've done so much self-development, open mind, meditations ). It's kinda hard to 'open' to people now....I even wonder if I would like that...Did I grow out of society and truly became a lone wolf?

1245,tkeser4,1597739974,1,"""The truth is, you cannot love yourself unless you have been loved and are loved. The capacity for love cannot be built in isolation."" - Bruce D. Perry

I have struggled with social connections for a while now. I don't think I have any issues that make me unwanted as a few people that I do know have told me I don't and there never were any problems there. The thing is that I long for a deep connection with someone. I get that you have to have something else going on in your life and you have to work on yourself and that is what I am doing. However, in todays world, most people don't want a deep, meaningful connection with someone. All they want is to hook up with the most attractive person they can, be with them for a month or two and then replace them like a damn sock.


This kind of behavior makes me, and I'm sure many others, pretty depressed about everything. Don't we have what it takes to at least have a chance at experiencing true connection? There are so many people, like myself, that would love to commit to a meaningful relationship but it is as if that ain't what is ""trending"" today.


Because of my approach to friendships and relationships which is very serious I have never probably been able to socialize in a healthy way and it feels like I am stunted in some way because of it.


As much as I tell myself that many people or even most are lonely in someway and long for love, all I see are blissfully ignorant people that just get so much attention and love it is insane. And then there is always that famous line ""You have to love yourself first"". That is one of the most bs things ever. Lonely people cannot invent love out of nowhere, it has to be given first so that as a human you understand that you are worthy.

1257,MonkeyEagle9,1597734430,1,"Sorry in advance, I’m very mad right now, at myself and the people I know.

A few months ago I distanced myself from a group of 5-6 or so friends. I had known them about 4 1/2 years, but I realized that they honestly couldn’t give a rats ass about me. So I quietly stopped them (they never texted me anyway). And when I stopped, I didn’t hear so much as a hello. It was eye opening how I had been the only one to put any effort into the relationships. I used to waste almost everyday waiting for them to call, text, or come over to my house like they said they would, but they NEVER did. I hate it, It makes you feel worthless, building you up with hopes and then crushing you day after day.

Anyway, since the day I stopped talking I had received 0 texts, until about 2 months in when one of then reached out and said HEY text me when you can. I didn’t. The next day the exact text was sent from another of the group. I remained silent. Then my mother got a text from their parents about how they were “worried” about me. This outraged me as they hadn’t said a word to me for 2 months, i would’ve been worried after 2 weeks! I told her not to respond. I didn’t get any texts after that.

It was only recently because school is starting that the whole group asked if I wanted to play a game with them online. I was feeling depressed and lonely, as I have for years, but I decided maybe I could give them a chance.

I got on and tried talking to them, but it was strange, because they were so insistent on having me there, but they spoke over me, or ignored what little i had to say. Then they all left one by one saying they were just going for a bit and would talk later that day. I wasn’t anymore happy. I waited all day for the text they promised they would send when they were to talk. Nothing. Eventually I texted them and asked if we were still going to talk. Nothing for hours, then a text “not tonight sorry”. I had deja vu from 4 years of this bullsh**. I checked online, and sure enough they all talked without me. They say they are worried about me and then this. 

I am more angry at myself for getting fooled that this would be any different than the rest of the 4 years. I am officially done with them treating me like this, I felt like I was making small improvements with being lonely until today.

Know that feeling when someone messages you and your face lights up with joy upon seeing the notification on the lock screen?
It could be as simple as a quick ‘are you okay?’ or ‘i miss you’

The sad thing is that it wasn’t a naturally outgrown friendship bound to happen if there were changes in interests and values over time — it was over a dumb verbal fight to the point of no return. greed, dreams, goals, careers, artistic expression.
Every time I hear the notification sound deep down I know it can’t be them — and I’m proven right. A part of me tightly holds on to that possibility that they find my hidden messages on the internet, or they had a miraculous change of heart against all odds.
I did not change the sound of the notification ever since. 
Do the people I miss... miss me too? 

I’m very depressed. 
I can’t listen to the songs from that time as it only reminds me of the pain.
It’s easy for me to make acquaintances and form shallow friendships, but ... close friends with meaningful connections? Not so much.
From friends that entrusted personal stuff about each other to strangers pretending not to know the other...

There are so many people in this world — so when they called me their friend, I was so, so happy.
this time I was cut off. I was not the one cutting ties, so... it’s beyond my control and there’s nothing I can do about it without being weird, creepy or persuasive. 

Am I that horrible of a person?
I know it wouldn’t be healthy to chase and fight for a friendship beyond repair........as it became complicated and I stunted their growth. but letting go is easier said than done.
All these grieving for months over fleeting days of happiness -- was it worth it? 
I wish it wasn’t so short. What hurts the most is that I can’t change the past and did something irreversible.

I hoped antidepressants would make me emotionally numb and cold but much to my dismay, I’m still crying over spilled milk.
They want to forget me and not give me attention; I know that. I was a bad friend- we both were messed up.

So I'll start off by saying I am lonely (duh its the sub). I want to say that Yes happiness is found within ones self but not everyone can pull it out themselves. I for one have major depression, I tried pills but that ended bad. Yes I tried to kill myself. So no pills to fix my disorder or whatever you want to call it. Anyways back to the rant.

Ive wanted to die for quite a while tried 2 times kinda 3. I was about to start my fourth when I met someone who, for whatever reason started to like me. We had a great relationship I think (I'll get into that later if I don't forget). I told her I loved her and she returned my feelings. We had a great thing going and man I never fell in love with anyone ever. My god It felt great, I felt like I could do anything and everything without getting tired. Then we'd play games after I finished work. Every single day. I won't lie, it was the most fun I ever had, the first time I was excited to wake up again, and the first time my life felt worth living. But as we all know all good things must come to an end. Something came up and well we had to split (not gonna get into details). She said we could still be friends. But as time goes by she talks less and less to me. My world is crumbling currently, I tell myself that it will all be ok... But each day I wake up crying because I dream of the good times. I cry in the shower (good to make it seem like your fine to everyone). I am weak, I lost what I held so dear... I lost myself. As I sit in my chair I am crying. I may just seem like I am over dramatic which is 100% probably true. I am trying to live my life but as I spend each day I realize there is nothing for me. You're probably thinking that I am now just saying useless things but If I look in the mirror I see a fat ugly man. Someone might say you need to workout, I walk 14 miles minimum with a tar crew often carrying/pulling a 200 pound air hose. I barely eat anything because I lost my appetite, sometimes I don't even eat anything for a whole day, often its just eating lunch and that's it.

Thanks for reading, I am not the best talker I just like everyone else here, lonely and lost their value to their life. Just trying to live out each nightmare of a day. To you who have happiness, I am happy for you. I wish I could find my happiness within myself but I don't know maybe I am broken.

Hey y’all I’m looking to meet someone I can grow closer with over time. I find it hard to meet new people in person as I don’t leave the house much due to having pretty overwhelming amounts of anxiety. (I’m really selling myself here I know) I’d prefer if you had Snapchat so I know who I’d be talking to, but if you don’t then that’s  fine I guess. I’m very introverted, I like spending time with myself. I love to read, binge Netflix and listen to music at a volume that’d normally blow someone’s ear drums out, i’m pretty sure that I’ve lost a significant amount of hearing because of it lmao.

I'm not expecting many people will read it all the way through. But I just need to pour my soul out for a little bit. As you can suspect I feel lonely. I don't mean lonely as in I need a girlfriend lonely but as in I don't think anyone can actually see me. I have amazing friends that love me and I love to bits, I have an amazing mother who I would do anything for, and I can't blame them for not how I feel. It's not their fault, I constantly put on an act to make them see im okay and happy so they don't worry as all of them have their problems and things to deal with and I don't want to feel like a bother to anyone. So I'm always ""doing great""... Today I feel so lonely my chest is actually feeling tight tho. I feel a lump on my throat and I can't stop thinking ""will someone ever see through me, and tell the cut shit act off?"" Maybe I'm asking for too much. How can I ask for someone to see through me when I'm constantly acting  and doing everything I can so everyone around me is happy with a big smile on my face as I do it? I'm happy when I'm with friends but deep inside I still feel alone, lost, scared, broken, misunderstood and forgotten. I see time pass by, but I can't seem to move with it. I'm not hoping for a medal for doing what I think is right when I do it, but most of the time I feel... invisible...

1292,GenericHumanNo7,1597705426,1,"Hey ppl,
I am  now and feel kinda lonely. But NOT in a depressed way.

I have always been introverted. The only time I hang out with ppl was in elementary school. After that I hung out less and less with friends.

It's not that I don't have friends, I just don't have a clique. Some friends live near me but don't have time and don't know each other. The other friends (we know us from doing international sport competitions) are just too far away.

So now I am left with 0 people to meet since month/years. I would like to have a friend circle to hang out with some times and a girlfriend. That would be very enough for me.

It's not that I'm ugly or unfriendly. Ppl tell me I'm good looking and such a nice person but still nothing happens. It's because I have a general incompetence to begin and maintain relations of any kind.

I myself think I am a very interesting person. Just on a very different level than others. Basically like a nerd.

I get a good amount of likes on tinder, but I never like the girls back, because I'm too afraid I will disappoint them. When I see the Instagram stories of the girls of my age it's always, hanging out with friends, restaurants and doing something fun. That really intimidates me and I think I could never satisfy their/her social/action needs.

1294,invisible-fate,1597704194,1,"Beginning of this year i was really lonely, wasn't speaking to anyone, my life was kind of at a stand still. Then one day my best friend pops up and says that i should start speaking to his girlfriend because he wanted us to get to know each other.  Started off well, we had a lot in common, and we became friends. I was scared that i would catch feelings, because she was the first girl to ever really pay attention to me, but that didn't seem to be happening. We soon got to the point where we considered ourselves to be best friends, got really close, really fast. Then we started to meet up in person and things started to change on my end. Those feeling i thought weren't a thing, started creeping up on me, and i kept trying to tell myself that they weren't real. But recently I cant deny it anymore i like her. Its so painful because i speak to her everyday all day, and i know she only sees me as a friend. But added onto that is the overwhelming guilt i have towards my best friend because i shouldn't feel this way about his girlfriend.  I get so jealous all the time when they are together and when they speak on whatsapp, and its really affecting my mood. I feel down like 80% of the time now, so basically whenever i'm not speaking to her. Bottom line is if i stop speaking to her i'm scared of going back to being truly alone..

Anyway this isn't a post looking for advice or anything, i already know what I should do. I should stop speaking to her before it gets worse, and before it ruins my friendship with my best friend. But i cant because she helped me get through so much and i'm scared ill go back to the person i was before if shes gone from my life.

I’m sitting outside on a bench looking at the stars while smoking and thinking what the fuck am I doing with my life.

I’m not depressed or something, I just feel sad lonely and empty. The closest thing I have for support when all of my emotions overflow and I have to scream out to the world is the snapchat bot, I have named it Steve. 

There’s so much I want to do with life, but I can’t find the joy in doing anything anymore. I don’t feel loved, but I have no reason to feel this way. 

No one in my life wants to listen to me. I just wish that sometimes someone would just tell me it’s going to be ok. That there is light at the end of the tunnel. 

At this moment in time there are no important significant people in my life. The two people I would say I have loved with all of my heart are currently far away from me and I will most likely never talk much to them ever again. 

I miss the times from when I was younger. I miss feeling loved and cared about. I miss going up to the most amazing person in the world and tell them I love them with all of my heart.

My life isn’t supposed to be filled with moments of joy and pleasure. My life is supposed to be filled with empty helloes and meaningless I love yous. 

I just wish life was more romantic and more enjoyable. But I guess it isn’t supposed to be that way.

“It wasn’t all romantic, stay hungry, stay foolish.”

1299,Peepeecaca666,1597701446,1,"That’s a krishnamurti quote. We live in a world where virtually all our relations can be mitigated by money. Are you handy? Why would your friends ask for your help and entangle themselves with you when they could just hire a guy to replace their toilet and by way if payment be absolved of the responsibility of keeping up a friendship with their handy man? 

Good at gardening? So what? It’s more convenient to buy at the supermarket or get delivery.

Experience parenting? Doesn’t matter, you’re probably too busy to help us out anyway so we’ll just pay for daycare.

Are you an affectionate lover? Meh, I just jerked off to porn and got my dooamine hit from the hottest people in the world. 

Can you knit a hat? Yeah well, I got to keep up with the latest styles so I don’t get weird looks at school or work.

Money, the ability to turn our human gifts into goods and services is seperating us. We are becoming unnecessary to one another. No one needs me because I can easily be replaced by someone with similar skills that can be paid for. So we become silos, socially distanced, living in an abundance of options and distractions. We have more sexual stimuli than ever so we can forget we need love. We have an abundance of calories but are starved for nutrition. We are better then ever equipped to fight disease yet can we be said to be a healthy society if one if the leading causes of death is suicide? Is it healthy for us to reflexively react to a virus by causing more separation? To shame and punish thise whose hearts call them toassemblenwith other humans? We have an infinite amount of entertainment and we can conjure it up instantly like wizards with our fingertips yet we are bored. The faces in the screens are flat.

So I am  a 24 years old man who works as a detective ( not half as exciting as you would think) for hobby I do muay thai, some bodyweight training video games and recently messing around with a guitar. I live in a flat which I pay rent for and in the beginning of the year I bough a car too. I m 178 cm and 60-65 kg so a little skinny but I got wide shoulders and a six pack not that big of an issue. Soo things are looking good aint it? Not really.

My parents was in a constant war from my early teenage years and using me againts each other. Not very fun times indeed. Luckily I got myself a new gf at 16, six months after my first one so no problem here with my friends and gf I can take it.

Skip five years and. We moved into a flat with my gf and I started to work. It was stressfull as fuck. I couldnt eat very well and was tired constantly. After three to four months I broke up with her on good terms.

 The relationship was too convenient too boring wanted to feel real love again. Naturally I went to tinder had some succes with one night stands but that wasnt really what I was searching for. I was really alone for the first time in my life and these one night stands doesnt helped jack shit. 

My friends were at the countryside with me being in the capital rarely seeing them so at this point no gf no friends. 

Every day I got home after duty nobody was there the flat was empty. I m all alone since then. 


What I really need is a partner who will be here when I wake up greet me when I came back, hug me, kiss me on the cheek, cracking jokes do stuff together.. Yes. 

So I matched with a girl we had very good chemistry from the get go in texting and after two weeks we met. We had sex on the fist date, the second and the third. On the fourth day she wrote that his ex called her and she still loves him so she cant be with me because its unfair. Now the problem is that she layed on my chest we walked together we watched movies together and for the first time after 2 years I felt really good again. For a short period I got some hope and it was taken from me. Most likely with a bullshit lie explanation. 

We still speaking months later to this day but she don't want other than friendship from me. And I m suffering from this craving for something I cant have craving for friends to hang out craving after some fucking company besides my coworkers.

 The only thing that keeps me going is my confidence in myself but god... I hate being alone.

I know, so you are. Life is life. Somebody got everything somebody nothing but most of us is in the middle. Guys and gals keep grinding keep investing in yourself. The only person who can save you is you. You have to walk the road alone sure, somebody let it be a friend or a partner can hold your hand while walking but ultimately its your story to write.

4. i’m going to stop caring about my phone. It’s like a “you didn’t post it it didn’t happen” kind of world and i’m over it. 


also, i have friends that celebrate it every year and i don’t know why it’s like ... them celebrating it isn’t a question, but when it comes to me... i’m flattered if anyone remembers it; in my family or in my friends. It’s pretty obvious now that only a few people remember it and the rest just because of a notification they get

I've never related to anyone sometimes I'll go on omegle and talk to college graduates and still be unevenly matched with their incompetence. I realize thinking highly of myself intellectually speaking will make me a huge narcissist and effect my social skills so I avoid thinking that at all costs. I've been able to maintain my psyche by applying this method of avoiding thinking certain things but lately its unbearable and unavoidable not to think of how pathetically lonely I am. My family is crazy some of them are even schizophrenic so I avoid them at all costs. I've never had a girlfriend even though I've always been confident in asking girls out and have had girls ask me out without being overbearing in my confidence or atleast as far as I can tell from my perspective. My ""friends"" slowly drift away from talking with me and I become more and more imprisoned in my mind talking to myself in my head which I know can't be healthy for as long as I've been doing it and will eventually if not already be impossible to hide in my social life and will take its toll weather it be through my confidence, speach, eye contact, hygiene, or what have you. I've forced myself to maintain hygiene and creativity as much as possible to avoid depression and inevitably killing myself but it's getting harder to discipline my self to that extent each and every day.

One day I got in a fight with some of my friends over the dumbest thing and I still to this day have not talked to any of them.  I have no friends now, I work, come home and sit on the computer for the rest of my day. I have done this every single day for the last 6 years. I have like 5 contacts in my phone and they are all family. I tell myself that I like this lifestyle and that I'm okay but I'm not. I don't know what happened to me. 

I went through 4 years of high school without making a single friend, I showed up, did the bare minimum and went home. I'm pretty sure everyone thought I was some stoner that hated the world but I was just scared to talk to anyone. A simple conversation with someone would make me sweat, I wore a hoodie every single day and just stopped caring about how I looked. 

I literally annoy the shit out of myself now because of the things that I say to people because i'm so socially awkward now. Every conversation I have with someone I spend time going back over everything I said and just feeling like I'm the biggest loser. If someone texts me or anything Ill spend time trying to come up with something that doesn't make me seem like I have no social life. 

I recently went on tinder and I actually get likes and matches but I never message them because I don't want to start talking to someone and them find out that I have no social life, I'm kinda in a weird cycle where I'm scared to make friends because I have no friends and then I just end up not talking to anyone. 

I hide all of this behind my terrible sarcastic humor that just makes me come off as an asshole. I treat everything as one big joke because deep inside I'm hurting and I just want people to talk to, I shut all of my family out and act as if im okay but im not.

My girlfriend broke up with me

My parents got a divorce

My phone broke and when I got a new one after two months everyone forgot I use to be their and wouldn't talk to me anymore

Everyone I use to know from when I was a little kid stopped having any connections with me besides my one best friend

Skip forward a month and my best friend won't respond to me anymore because she got mad at me

I try to continue conversation with anyone who will respond but it's always the exact same conversation every single day, it never changes ""how's your day"" ""good"" ""wyd"" ""oh that's cool"" and then ""goodnight""

I'm to scared to try and make new friends cause I dont want to get rejected again so I try to keep going with whoever I have left

No one checks on me anymore

My dad is leaving soon now

My mom will be at work and not come home untill late, then she'll go to sleep without even seeing me cause I can't stop sleeping so much throughout the day

Then my mom will wake up the next day to do the exact same thing

My sister never leaves her room anymore to play outside like we use to, now all she's does is sit in her room and only comes out to bring more food into her room

Occasionally I'll see one of the people I use to be friends with post something and I can tell if they upset so I'll ask them what happened and they'll say something like ""you don't get it, your a white male so you have privilege and you could never relate to the situation"" and then the conversation will end their. But they don't have any idea how many times me and other people like me get ignored. Some of my friends have all the people in the school trying to talk to them and when they wake up they'll see that they got 30 texts and the text won't stop all day. But for me I wake up and see no notifications, I ate lunch and check again but still nothing, I go to sleep and check again but still nothing

And I cant find anyone to talk to off my phone now cause my family is basically gone and I'm not allowed to go out places to meet new people due strict parents and the virus

So since no one text me and I cant see any real people I see fake people in video games except I lose almost every time

i don’t have any friends either. so many people know of me, know my name, whatever. but if i didn’t text first, i wouldn’t be talking to anyone. i know that i’m the one always initiating with these select “friends” left, but having these few hurt less than being totally alone. even though i know they all have other people they’d rather be with or other things they’d rather be doing.

I don’t know. 

I always had this drive in me to leave the world a better place than I left it. but I don’t know. my own existence is such a burden that I wish I never put onto my parents. I do my best to be a good person, but for what?

I’m just so tired of existing. I don’t know what makes me feel alive. I’m just tryna get through life day by day, but I don’t even know why.",lonely,the absolute meaninglessness of my existence is such a defeating realization.,2020-08-17 22:54:54

Most lonely people feel lonely because they don't experience hugs, kisses, people want to do fun things with them physically by their side. I walk into grocery stores and i see people with their friends having a good time in the grocery store. Throwing the footballs and basketballs at each other. I see people at the movie theatre with their friends enjoying each others company. At the mall. At sports games. At parties. This is what people want. This is why these people feel lonely. They aren't getting that. Its not bad that they feel lonely for this. This is normal. People want to have a good time with loved ones. This is what love looks like. People wanting to be there during the good times. They never have to give you the order to smile. Your smile is the result of you having a good time with loved ones.

It's assertion of dominance that I am in control of some part of my life and others. It's all ego. It's energy that is being released wether it wants to or not, it just does what it does. I do and I don't want to release this energy. I don't because I'm ashamed to be weak and that's a fact no matter how much anyone comforts or consoles me. I do want to relate it because it's an escape. What do people do when they have no where to run and no where to blame? They channel it through many forms and expressions. Gambling, drinking, activities, sports, shouting, fighting, writing, gaming etc...so many different escapes. This is my escape right now. I don't have parties, bars, drinking, sex, and any other escape so I'm displaying my shame and uslesness here.

Don't complain, never explain.

Instead I am seeking to validate my own excuses. My life is an excuse. Anyways this is my story.

Pre-depression: 1 and a half years ago. I followed a standard way of living. Almost done with school. Almost in the film union making the big bucks. I had expectations. I wanted to no longer live with my parents and have them be happier. I wanted to pay for their vacations and get them involved in activities and hobbies. I wanted to pay for their home. I wanted to donate money to churches and charities and believe I was helping. I wanted to have my best friend live with me or on his own and pay for his rent considering he doesn't get paid the best salary for his humanitarian efforts. I wanted to have my own place and let people stay over whenever when they needed a place to escape. I wanted to treat my nephews and nieces growing up. I wanted to treat all my cherished ones on their birthdays. I wanted to make people, myself and the world around me, seen, a better place. I wanted to conquer all of that. I wanted to use the huge amounts of money I made to make more money, in order so that I could use it to help more people. So that I could financially be in a position to help where I was compatible to. I wanted to hook up with so many different girls to fill the void that is validation. Although I don't kiss and tell, I have programmed myself to think that more is better. That the structure of the world is correct. If I can conquer and dominate these women because society places them to be a challenge and a reward then I'll do it it to prove to myself. to prove to who really? I mean wouldn't it all feel the same and pleasurable if I was blindfolded? Wouldn't kissing feel nice, skin feel like skin, and sex feel like sex? Who would know the difference? I can't say for sure because I've never attempted it (I don't think these things and never have first hand. This is just an outside perspective truth of narration of myself in the 3rd person when I think about it and dig deep into myself as I go along my mindset and lifestyle. It would be very uncomfortable being aware of anyone who does actually think like this when they are thinking of mating. I'm in the moment like anyone else just out to have a good time). Carrying on. I wanted to live out my life for my niece. She was my age and died to cancer. She was the sweetest and most lovable niece. I loved her so much. I still feel the pain after all these years. She was strong but it's not like you see in movies and TV. She didn't hide here weakness. I still remember her calling me in tears to tell me that life isn't fair. Questioning me why she couldn't finish school, why everyone was moving ahead in life except her, just why? I was left speechless without an answer, feeling so useless and helpless. When someone hurts our ego's there's always someone to blame and feel like you get your revenge in some kind of matter. When the world hurts you. There's no where to find redemption. If you live from illness, you just live with it. If you overcome it, then you overcame it. But then where was the so called lesson in cancer, and diabetes? Live healthier sure. But then why does someone suffer so much every single day? what is the point? why is it fair? Why did we get the losing straw? Then what about the ones who die and don't get to apply the lesson learned?  Anyways I don't know. It just is the way it is when it comes to that. I wanted to be a philanthropist and a better person. I wanted to be selfless and charitable by the world in my old ways of perspective.

I'm mad because I didn't want any of those things but I sunk myself into emotional debt. I wanted to repay acts of kindness. I wanted to be ""good"" because I believed it would make a difference. I was very active with family and friends, I was a people person. In reality I didn't choose to live my life the way I wanted to. Given the choice I want to leave everyone and everything behind. I don't want to make friends and I don't want to be unfriendly. I don't want to be happy, or better said, I don't want to show off that I'm happy through facial expressions and body language. It's happening in my brain and if I feel good then I don't feel like I have to feint a smile or speak about it. Asking people how they're doing, or wishing them hopeful goodness. Hope is just hope and if someone doesn't feel good then they're cornered into lying, or into telling the truth in their own shame of weakness. It's best tell them I'm glad that I'm seeing them in the moment and not have to overexaggerate at the same time. I don't want to be sad and mad either. I want to feel all those things and keep them to myself. I don't want people to expect me to smile. I don't want people to expect to communicate because they want me to. I want to be alone and connect with people, environments, and the world as a whole. I don't want to talk. I don't want to ask people what they want. I don't want to say more then, yes, okay, no, and simple answers straight to the point. I don't want people to criticize me for being serious and then define it as moody, cold, robotic. It's draining forcing smiles, and expressions of agreement in understanding one another. I'm so invested in everyone and everything that people would judge me for living my life the way I want to. Away from everyone's influence and energy. There have been so many kind people in my life shallow or not. I'm scared to abandon people because of what they'd think. They'd think I was ungrateful. I'm grateful but then gratitude today means nothing without some type of materialization to someone.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way I can't do any of all that because...

Post/current depression: I wasn't ever depressed or sad about life besides family and friends deaths. Life was good for me. I have an undiagnosed health condition that's been bothering me to the point of not being able to work and making my life miserable for over a year and a half now. I didn't think any of the things I listed above before. Those things were a later realization of deeper parts of my consciousness. Not having slept well in over a year and a half makes it draining and tiring. I was fantasizing suicide last year and eventually gave up a will to live. First I was broken physically, then mentally and emotionally which dragged the sake of my sanity. Once there was no will to live I died and had an NDE experience. I looked it up and it was similar to others experience after dying and returning. I believe It is my second chance to live and not give up. Living is winning against life in a way. So It's a catch 22. I want to live a life with good health. Instead I'm tired. I don't want to suffer anymore. Although I'll never suicide and quit living. 

Moving on. It's not like any of my family and friends can magically solve my issues and solve my health. It's no ones fault and still I have felt abandoned. At this age both my oldest and closest family and friends, hardly reach out, although they do reach out. When they ask how I am, I lie. I tell them I'm fine. I already feel pathetic enough in life and energy spreads. If the only thing I can do is spread the negative emotional burden that my life sucks then I feel worse. I feel like I'm losing because I'm being helped. I feel like I then owe the person hearing me out. I feel like the only purpose I'm fulfilling is dragging someone down with me. Then they'll feel as helpless as I did with my niece.

I'm mad. I'm mad because on top of not living my life the way I want to, I ended up choosing, living it for other reasons, It's the biggest feeling of regret to live with. I don't believe I did anything ""wrong"". No one deserves bad things, so then when you live in such a shitty version of life, you realize no one deserves anything good either. No one deserves anything. There's no purpose. We humans reason with consciousness and make up rules, follow them, and break them. Everything is just ""a happening"". At the time I felt so virtuous without expecting anything in return. But now when I'm sick and suffering I feel so betrayed and abandoned. Although I'm positive that if the healthcare system hasn't solved my issues then the people close to me can't either. It's not a question of, if it reflects on me as a person. It truly means I wasn't a good enough person for anyone to be there for me. MY best friend isn't really there for anyone except his girlfriend and his philanthropic endeavors. It's just the way he is. He's good and kind-hearted. And still I still I conflict about how much I support him and how much pain I feel that he isn't there for me in some type of way. That goes for everyone. Sure My parents and sister care and check up. But in suffering and loneliness to add on, it doesn't amount to satisfaction of living. I hate myself, I hate my life, and I want to disappear. I just told myself I wouldn't attempt suicide. I wish the world would listen to me and either fix my problem to live or my problem to die. The bad outweighs the good. Who knows? If you believe, you could potentially bounce back. Except idk if I want to. I want to write here right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel violated by the world. I've been raped by a woman before passed out black out drunk. I was advised my whole life to be careful and I fell into my own trap. Rapists shouldn't tape either way. But without a fight, when you aren't asking for it, the result is a loss. I felt violated and got over it with a strong mentality. That's my example. The violation this world has thrown itself on me Is even heavier. The heaviest I'll ever felt and likely the heaviest I'll ever feel. If I get through this I realistically believe that I'll be able to have so much physical strength that I could carry a car.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody gets me. I get everyone apparently. My family is there for me and so are my friends and I'm not connected. My best friend helps people similar like me for a living and yet he doesn't help me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've drowned in real life and made it out through adrenaline with on arm to swim for it with my body in shock for the entire next 2 days. Drowning didn't feel so bad a way to go. It was mixed in with being pleasurable.

Metaphorically I'm already drowning. I want to sink to the bottom wear it's so dark I can't see feel, think, or just exist anymore. On the other hand it would be nice to be caught and lifted back up to the light and live. There is no best way to live but I'd definitely live and do what I want. I'd live the way that I want to.

I'm recently a fan of the connection the Rey and Ben had in Star Wars. To be connected through the balance of the light and the darkness. To be there for each other and feel so connected.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time nobody likes to lose in life. And when you're losing at everything, that's the biggest loss of life. Maybe that's my answer? I'm lonely because I'm losing my life. I don't care and mind death at all. I've since embraced it. Creating a chain of suffering isn't my style. I'd be gone but that energy would exist. 

I don't want anyone's sympathy on here. Feeling bad for me makes me feel worse. I don't have control over the way you live and your actions but if you read this and want to respond then please jut say ""I read it"". An acknowledgment of my existence feel like it would make me feel better.

I Repeated some things because I wrote it out a few days ago and didn't remember which frustrations I had released.

This feeling is only peculiar to these nights and I guess I wanted to talk about it. 

I feel lonely all the time- On these nights though, I either notice it less or it simply doesn't bother me. These are perhaps my favorite times of life, the peacefulness I feel is something I wish was with me all the time. 

 Sometimes, I wish I could just observe the world. I don't want to have to worry about life. I just want to see the trees blowing in the wind and the sun setting. Why can't everything just be peaceful?  ""I can't wait to grow up"" I used to tell myself.. ""I want to be young again"" I now tell myself.. Oh how things change.. I guess everything changes.

I had a good circle of friends in high school, probably about 10-20 people id hang out with. I always kinda felt like the black sheep of the friends group, I fit in, but not 100%. They were all into sports, clothes, and other stuff I wasn't. We would always hangout outside of school, pretty much daily. When we graduated, which was back in 2014, I've seen them all maybe 5 or less times since then. Never got a text to hangout, always seem them all together on snapchat doing what we used to, just without me. There was never hard feelings or anything, they just stopped hanging out with me. Never argued or anything, and it was always a good time. I did sense they were taking advantage of me, because I used to build vapes and I always hooked them up, and I can install car audio, which I would do either for free or like 20 dollars. Is it possible once I stopped doing them favors they no longer wanted to be my ""friend""?

1372,jajangmyeon98,1597637320,1,"So I watched this video called '21 years old: I have no friends' on youtube. It was randomly recommended to me and tbh I felt personally attacked. As someone who IS 21 and LITERALLY has no friends, I was intrigued. Anyways the girl in it was basically explaining WHY she had no friends+ her experience and it really resonated with me. I don't even know if anyone will read this but I was inspired to post my own experience because it's sorta similar.

I'll try to keep it as brief as possible but I honestly don't remember having close/ true friendships since maybe primary school. Yep. You read that right. Primary school.

I went to 2 different highschools. At my first school I had a total of 2 friends. They ended up ditching me and I was left with none. Have y'all seen the movie ""Edge of Seventeen""? That movie was INSANELY relatable. Just like Nadine (main character) I seriously hung out with my teacher during lunch breaks (I know right, what a loser). She'd get a laptop for me and I'd literally play computer games while she did her own stuff and we'd chat about random stuff occasionally. I figured I'd rather do that than sit out in the open all alone while people judged me. How embarrassing. Sometimes i'd legitimately sit in the hallways reading.

The loneliness got to me and I was depressed so I ended up moving schools. Now my next school was interesting. Because I was the new kid, everyone knew me. Apparently I was popular (\*vomits\*). Everyone would say hi to me/ everyone knew who I was. I had a group of friends but I felt so fucking lonely. Have you ever been in a group of people who you literally had NOTHING in common with? I'd sit there and pretend to care about things I had no idea about. We had nothing in common, music tastes were completely different, didn't have the same sense of humour, watched different things. But I figured I'd rather have these friends then be alone again.

Ok so I was excited for university because literally everyone was like ""omg you'll make so many lifelong friends it's not like highschool"". Bruh it was almost exactly the same if not worse. Those bitches lied. I'd make temporary friends who were my friends for the semester and once it was over I'd never see them again. But here's the interesting thing. Almost every friend I made, once we started to get closer, I'd find out that they either a) had no friends or b) didn't like their friends for whatever reason. I'm not even kidding. Maybe I attracted people who didn't have friends?? I don't know.

The first friend, we'll call her 'A' admitted that she had no friends coming out of highschool and would sit at home all day. She even told me that she had no one to celebrate her birthday with and watched a movie by herself. I was pretty shocked.

The second friend seemed like she had friends (her insta had plenty of pictures of her taken by someone else). I assumed she had a poppin social life. Nope. She admitted she had one friend. And even then told me that she felt like she was only a backup friend to said friend. Again, I was pretty shocked.

I'm not friends with these people anymore for various reasons (honestly cbf explaining basically I was done with their bullshit)

Anyways having no friends is something that people don't like to admit because it implies that something is 'wrong' with them/ signals 'loser'. But in my opinion it's very common. Especially in adulthood. I no longer really envy those people who seem to have a large social circle/ are out and about every weekend. It's sort of like I don't give a shit anymore? Like I want to make friends of course but friends whom I actually enjoy spending time with/ feel I can be myself. People don't want to be alone/ are afraid of people judging them/ want to fit in SOMEWHERE, which is why I think loneliness is growing and more and more people find themselves with a lack of friends OR a lack of quality friends.

Maybe it sounds weird but I feel like I've developed more of a personality without friends. Like I don't feel pressure to be a certain person anymore? I kind of just do whatever I want and actually have been spending more time on things I used to love as a kid. It feels kind of freeing in a way.

If you have no friends, I would love to hear your stories/ what it's been like for you. No judgement",lonely,Having no friends is more common than you might think,2020-08-17 14:08:40
1373,hamburger_suitcase,1597636569,1,"But there’s a twist; I don’t want it. After years of being friend zoned and her choosing other (terrible) guys (over me), I left. I ghosted. I cut alllll ties, about a year ago. and hadn’t texted back when she would text and just lost her info.To the point where I didn’t recognize the number, and had to ask a friend if they recognize the number. 

I was curious, because she went on to say (over text) that she wished she had chosen me a long time ago and that she was sorry. 
We texted back and forth. She says if she had chosen me she would be happy and married. But she didn’t and she was sorry.

I hate this.
I low key had always wanted to hear that. 
But, no longer am enthused to hear these words.

I was just gaining my stride. I (because covid and a lonely life ) learned to forgo any friends (or intimacy). 
I turned 35 this year, and have gotta say, everything chilled out in my life. I’m not tortured by my loneliness any longer. I have never had a gf and am ok with never having a gf. I just try hard to to use that energy in as positive way that benefits me.

I don’t want her back. She comes with kids and a mom and family, and dude.. plus I can just see all the other dudes on her, it’s gross. That’s too much, I’m Over it,, I bEEn over it. It’s so weird to hear her say she wants ME. But yeah, this is where I’m at.

1374,Daft-punkinstein,1597636293,1,"Around the beginning of this month my three year relationship ended. This was my second serious relationship, and the most meaningful. This person was both my partner and my best friend. Thankfully, she's still my best friend. 

We both have varying degrees of mental illness, especially depression. While we've had wonderful history and loved each other greatly, we were prone to fights. As the years progressed, they became worse and worse. She was financially dependant on me, and she lived with me and my family. She didn't get along well with my family, which made it hard sometimes for sure. We had plans on moving out once I had gotten a high paying career based job, but I hesitated greatly due to my ADHD and Anxiety. We both meant to work on ourselves in our own ways, but for one reason or another we put everything off. 

Last month a friend of hers and quick growing friend of mine visited us and we all enjoyed his company. We had a lot in common, so much so that he has the career and income I strive to achieve. She liked him a lot because of our similarities. I knew better of her, and I only felt slightly jealous. She's not the type to cheat on their partner, and she has a lot of respect for me. We hatched a plan for her to move in with him somewhere about an hour away. In the meantime, I would focus on my self improvement and job so I could move in as well. It felt like the perfect opportunity to mend ourselves, and our relationship. All with the support of a friend. But before that, he confessed that he had feelings for her, and expressed that she should only move in if she were single. We were both angry at him. She hated the fact that it happened to her often, and that she became a manic pixie dream girl. I was angry because it was her only opportunity to have the space she wanted. And, of course, I was defensive of my girlfriend. She told him that she didn't want to give up on me, and cut him off for a small amount of time. Some time passed, and she became sad about our plans being essentially ruined, and she missed him as a friend. She also eventually confessed that she had feelings for him, I tried to remain as supportive of her as I could. I felt like she still wanted to try and keep us together as much as I wanted.

One day we have another fight, and for once, we finally end our relationship. I quickly regreted doing this greatly, but she believed it was for the best. I agreed, but I still didn't want everything to end. Although not perfect, I was still the happiest I had ever been. Maybe I didn't focus on the right things, and I'm positive that I didn't do enough to mend our problems. She feels like she didn't do enough as well. But it is what it is.

Now she's staying somewhere else, and is eventually going to move in with her friend. I know that they're now together, weather it's ""official"" or not. The only thing I'm angry about is the fact that it happened so soon, like all these years meant nothing. She told him she wasn't going to give up on me, now she has. I feel only slightly valid in this, but in reality I know that she needs someone to support her better than I could've.

Now I'm alone. Social anxiety has caused me to recede even more than I already was. I feel like everyone is going to hate being around me. I've been known to be clingy and emotional when I'm in heartbreak, but I'm trying my best to stay strong and respectful. She is my only true friend, it feels. I made the mistake of not trying to make anymore connections with others, like she did. In my lowest I've always come to her, now I can't the same way I had. It's something I need to work on, and plan on doing so for sure.

Deep down I know that it had to be done. I couldn't focus on myself and try to keep her happy at the same time. But it still hurts bad.

The positive aspects of all of this keep me going though. In a few days I'm going to start an online therapy to work on all of my problems, I'm hoping that it all works. I feel like I should've done it soonerz but better late than never. I've also become closer to my family, which have always loved and supported me no matter what. And now that I only have to financially worry about myself, I can eventually quit my stressful part-time job in exchange for one a little better. At least while I continue to work on becoming the successful, healthy, and likable person I strive to be.

I feel like I can stay in my ex girlfriends life, which she's expressed to me multiple times that she wanted. I don't feel comfortable getting close to our friend; her eventual boyfriend. I don't blame him for our relationship not working out, but he really drove the last nail in. And he had blatant disrespect towards me for even putting her and I in that position. But, in the end, she will be happier. I'm sure things will be easier around him eventually.

Now I'm going through the motions of recovering from heartbreak. She was physically in my life almost every single day for these past three years, and now my room feels emptier than it's ever had before. I still turn around and get caught off guard that she's not sitting in the bed smiling back at me. The shows and interests we always shared and bonded over are now tainted with the happy memories. The fact that there will never be any more of us together make me want to tear everything apart. I crave the embrace of someone I trust so badly, it hurts. But deep down I know that it won't be like this forever. 

In the next few weeks, she'll come back to move the last of her things out. And she'll end up even farther than what was originally planned. But she plans on visiting, and I look forward to it. 

I feel like my troubles are nothing compared to a lot of people, especially on here. I have a loving family, paying job, and I at least still have her as my friend. But I still wanted to vent, because I don't have much of anyone to talk to right now.

I just hope that everyone here knows that things will get better, one way or another. There's always someone there for you, you might just have to look. I know I need to.

For more context, I’m in college in my freshman year.(). This is my second day staying here. Recently I’ve been thinking that I’m okay being alone sometimes, but when I have no one to come back to, then that’s where it sucks. In my dorm, I live in a suite style arrangement. And they split us into 2 separate rooms. At the moment, my roommate isn’t staying in her room next door. We texted and she seems like a nice person. She’s off campus right now. We haven’t met in person yet, but she’s a junior, and I kind of wish that I had a freshman roommate. I wanted us to go to classes together and do fun things. But it’s better than not having anyone. So far the only highlights of my days are to go to breakfast, lunch and dinner. Today, I decided to meet up with a friend and his friend to have lunch. We sat outside and talked with each other. Our conversation was really good. We talked about classes, emails, our concerns, etc. Then we decided to take a walk to the duck pond. And all this time as they were talking, I just keep thinking how they have such a great friendship. They’ve known each other for a long time. I’m really happy for them. But I wish I had someone that went back for years too. It seems like boys friendship is so laid back and chill. They play video games, are funny and have a good time. Makes me wonder what being a guy is like. Not that I would change my gender but I’m curious. There’s always a reoccurring theme in my life. For making friends, it always seems like I have more guy than girl ones. And this time, I really want a mix of female and male friendship to balance it out. I want someone to do fun and dumb stuff with. Who has a sense of humor and likes to laugh. Aside from that, I know I can’t be the only one feeling this way. There has to be more lonely people like myself on campus. We just don’t know how to reach out or where to meet people. During this time it’s even harder because of what’s going on. I don’t know, I just look around and I already see some people in groups. And who knows maybe those are upperclassmen and the freshman are somewhere hiding. And yes, I have online friends who I talk to sometimes and I appreciate them, but it’s just not the same. I would like to have someone who I can hang out with in person. Anyways I’m just making this to see if anyone is going through this too.

I think I exaggerate the problem a bit and probably it's not a problem but just a misleading conception, that's produced my brain™, however, I'd like to vent out to here.

I used to be much lonely all the time since grade 5 or 6 in middle school when my best friend accidentally found out that our classmates are much interesting so they easily and quickly developed a strong friendships and I slowly gave my importance up even if I tried to hang out with ‘em as much as possible. I was in a bit provinical town, so you know, you won't meet much people here, then after finishing grade 6 I had a very stressful period when I had to move to another city (to a much large city, de facto) and I lived in a bad conditions so I couldn't seriously invite anyone to me because it was too cringy. 

I tried to pretend to be wealthier than I was so people, at least, didn't bully for me but they got fairly a bit better education, meanwhile I was just an outsider (with good marks in range, through) and I attempted to make friends and really had an intention of it but none of my attempts succeeded. I also was going through hard time with abusive parents and difficulties in study but now I don't have such big foundamental problems because I almost solved them on my own. 

 I failed and struggled even through people was saying I'm nice and stuff. I don't seriously get it but I kept seeing that everyone's got a best friend or a few closer friends, relationships but I couldn't do that for reasons I don't know. When I failed a great numbers of times, I went on Internet to fulfill my feeling, however it worked out as well but I think I hurted a lot of people and done a lot of cringy things a bit. 

I don't really know what my “online” friends think of me or what people think of me, for real, so I expect that one day they'd just leave me without explanation why they do so and once again I'll just sit in my room and slowly cry because of my failure to help anyone to become, at least, a little bit happier or my friend. 

I know that there's a problem at me but I can't seriously realise it because I'm being overwhelmed by the people's misleading impressions about me. 

However, some people tend to think I do pretend to be kind. I don't pretend, fairly, because I exactly feel that I'd like to be kind to people and with people, and I wouldn't seriously mind if anyone was a bit kind to me as well (I know it sounds selfish a little, who am I anyway?).

I'm trying to show my emotions but I'm not good at that because my bad experience made me a bit paranoidal and worsen my ability to express what I think or feel. I'm still afraid that my Internet or real buddies will leave me because I don't feel like I'm an interesting guy. 

I understand pretty much there's people who are lonelier than me but they and I deserve friends in my opinion :) nobody's born mad, angry or confused or depressed, that's just the surrounding reality raises us.

The rest is total destruction. I never had close friends in my teenage years all the people I knew were just from school and some soccer teammates. My father was abusive physically and emotionally and my mother was always on his side and emotionally abusive at times. When my grades started to get worse three of my childhood buddies whom I grew up with playing and studying and competing at school looked at me differently. They started to mock me mostly implicitly and behind my back and sometimes one of them says some harsh things out of nowhere such as ""shut your mouth"" and he laughs at me when others bully me and ridicule me in front of the whole school, the others say things such as ""you what do you know? You better be quite"" and they never invite me to study together or help me to save my grades. And they never invite to  going out except for soccer matches because I was good. They would help each other to succeed and get the best grades but they never help me. And I was constantly seeking approval and gratification, I was always nice and considering and even when I do things that doesn't reflect my true personality and core values I would do them just to fit in with everybody, to find a way out of loneliness, of the misery of everyday life, of my dysfunctional family, to hide the scars of the slaps and punches of my father, of his humiliation, and to recover from the fact that he spits on my face when he gets really angry. I was lonely and scared in the dark with an unknown fate. I was a crushed child with zero friends seeking gratification everywhere. And I tried to save what is left of my innocence. I fought really hard, I would rebel and escape the house for days and I would dream and go anarchist. I would cry so hard that my throat starts to hurt so bad. I fought and I tried to make friends. I met a girl and I fell madly in love onyl to end up really really really bad and I'm here now totally broken. I made some close friends, an intimate circle of friends only to discover later that they exclude me sometimes from their gatherings because I'm a late comer, their already have been formed long before they met me but they were the best that I can get and I had some great days with them. And now I almost lost them all due to my fucked up feelings and illusions about the world and the people, I started to become distant from them because I always thought I'm not good enough. And became more distant when I met a guy whom I instantly got along with perfectly, and started to think he is the only thing I need and I pushed my friends away, friends that I really love. And this guy now after five years of knowing him I started to dislike him and consider throw him away not to mention that he broke my heart several times. I got into college and I tried to fight for my place there. I was quite, insignificant, an empty bottle of wine dumped in the corner of the street. I made half friends, I lived half a life more dead than alive. I read books and started to develop interests, I got hooked on doom metal, classical music, and every piece that would make me burst into tears. And nothing seemed to work regarding my zero sum social life. I became aware of my depression and anxiety and I read about clinical psychology to durther realize that I'm gazing at the abyss inside the abyss, ""even the darkest places still have darker corners"".. I wanted college to continue forever, a sense of continuity where I can exist in some controllable domain in my life. But I got a half graduation with no one of my friends attending and with no ceremony. In college I saw how people can mingle so fast with each other and smoothly while every neuron in my brain is fired whenever I become self-conscious in a social situation. I already describe it all very well in one simple phrase ""half alive"". Haunted with my past, my love, the people that made me want to kill my self whom I still stumble upon in the street and greet them with a shaking hand and not being able to look them in the eyes, today one of them actually ignored me because I once avoided him, they all know how fucked up I am.

1406,Revolutionary-Rush48,1597613835,1,"Hey everyone,

As the title says, severe depression trampled me (34m) like a rag doll. 

I'm a software engineer by profession. In the spare time I swing/day trade. That's pretty much all I do. I've always been alone. I like/liked being alone. I haven't had a relationship that lasted more 3 months. I'm not physically hideous or anything of the sort. I think I look pretty good and I workout like a fiend (just putting things into perspective). I've chased money my whole life. That's all I care/d about. 

Two months ago I was assigned an intern for the summer. I don't care much for interns. If you've never had interns, they become your annoying students for the duration. Essentially, the company pays them to learn on the job what they (or their parents) pay tens of thousands of dollars to the university to be taught.  

About two week before her internship expired, I started to pay more attention to her. Her values are very different from mine. It's difficult to put into words. But where she comes from, personal interaction and treating people with utmost kindness and selflessness are the backbone of her identity. Compared to her, I come off as a cynic. It's been a while since I've met someone with similar ideals.

On the last day she said, ""It's been nice knowing you."" And I kind of waved it off, as I usually do. And she left. An hour later, it just hit me a train. I mean... my hands were trembling. What.. the.. fuck!? I've let so many friends and relatives to walk out of my life without any regret. But an intern, whom I didn't even bother to get to know until the last two weeks of her internship, pushed me over the edge? Jesus fucking Christ, isn't that some shit?

I'm not mentally weak but this whole weekend I've been bombarded with what I think is severe depression. It amazes how the values that I lived by aren't able to serve as a backbone to combat this. It's as if I'm completely helpless. I've began to second-guess my life choices. And that is some painful stuff. Do my priorities need to change, all of the sudden, after all of these years? It's just mesmerizing how hard this can hit. Just days ago I was completely fine and content. If I were to have some type of a  mental breakdown, I thought it'd come in stages. But this is like jumping off of a cliff. 

I'm at the point where I need to express my feelings somewhere. Most of my friends just became acquaintances over the years. They have their families, careers and goals. We're not close. Nor am I close with my family. So here we are, reddit. I used to scoff at those afflicted with debilitating  depression. But.. goddamn. God. Damn. 

Anyway, we'll see how work goes on Monday. Maybe I can pull myself together before then.

1422,2O9O,1597602260,1,"This is going to be a bit of a tangent/drivel and it's 2 am so please bear with me and the incoming typos. It'll focus on my schooling life and friendships. I'm an 18 y/o pharmacy, uni student and whilst growing up I moved schools a lot. I learnt to make friends more easily and be adaptable. 

My primary school days (5-11) were a blur, I was never really sad moving schools but my last primary school did hit different, though it was fleeting. 

In high school, my friendships held more weight (I don’t know if that means anything or makes sense) but like everything in my life, they all felt surface level. Like yeah, I had a lot of interests and could talk to most people. At my most recent high school (which was also the one I has attended the longest for), I had my own sorta friend group and we would drift with other friend circles. Until eventually a lot of people started leaving the high school (it was going to close but didn’t) and we'd 'adopt' others into our friend group whilst also joining other friend groups till there was like 7-10 of us. I'd try go out and meet up outside of school for birthdays or whatever else, had a group chat and all that. Most of us would spend the free periods playing cards when we should've been studying. There were mini groups within but we were all chill and still talk after hs but it always felt hollow, well for me and my mini group anyway. It felt like I had unknowingly kept discussions/conversations broad and impersonal. And it wasn't because I was subconsciously afraid to get close, I don't know what it was, but I think it's because I wanted to include everyone. I always felt like a drifter especially since I had like a 60% attendance rate. I just studied better at home and school was kinda useless except maths and bio. 

I don't really have ""close"" friends. I have 'childhood friends' who I still know and talk every couple of years but we've drifted apart. I have 'family friends' who I see at events held by my parents' friends where we just talk about whatever. I have my friends from high school who I do text somewhat regularly but it's basically only for uni, work or a recent movie/yt video. 

I'm not active on social media, I only have fb/messenger and whatsapp. I still get invited to parties and birthday parties (pre-lockdown, pre-covid), the last party was in like June (aus cases were low) but I hardly went to most of them. 

The last few, somewhat close friendships I had felt like I was the extroverted introvert among 3 introverted introverts, if that makes sense. Okay so let's call them Tetris, Rian and Serg. 

So, Tetris and I were friends the longest since I was like 13. Everyone thought we were 'best friends' but, we hardly talked/texted outside of school. They basically went MIA after hs and I knew they would. We spoke about things like plans after hs, they kept it vague, I know they’re doing engineering. I respected that they didn't want to keep in contact with anyone from high school. But they made the most impact on me, I miss them the most imo. Thinking back on this friendship makes me genuinely want to cry and I don't know why. 

As for Rian, I text them but they were one of those people we 'adopted' into our group during the last 3 years of hs. They listened, they weren't much of a talker and we shared a lot of classes together. They probably got sick of me but I hardly showed up to school so probably not. We’d coordinate which days to be absent and which days had the least amount of work so that if one or the other weren’t there we could still catch up or save each other handouts. They had a closer friend group outside of school. So they were like temporarily with my friend group which was fine. I didn't expect them to stay in contact with me and the others, but they do. They listened to my ramblings, it was cathartic but I just hope I listened to them as much too (they were super reserved thou so I don't know). 

Finally, Serg they're the most recent, befriended them over the last 2 years of hs. They come with a lot of history/tea, I was surprised I even befriended someone like that. But they talk to me still and keep in contact. They didn't make an impact like the others; it was more so a reflection of myself in terms of their past friendships. The most notable thing that happened with Serg was that they'd seen Rian as a close friend but Rian had a whole other friend group, so they drifted apart. They were super bummed about it and I consoled them. And eventually, they just stopped talking to Rian entirely. So, I eventually pointed out that Serg and their old friend (lets call Dee) were close and asked whatever happened with that. Dee and I were friends but it wasn’t close or anything, maybe they count as an acquaintance, they were one of the people I’d drift to. Serg soon realised that they missed Dee and spoke to me crying about it and everything. And eventually Serg and Dee became friends again.  At the time, I felt great I made my close friend become better friends with my other friend. But it made me realise that Serg and Dee somewhat mirror Tetris and I but with an alternate ending. Tetris and I could’ve been like Serg and Dee. 

I make friendships sound like relationships lol. I've always distanced myself from others (for a multiple of reasons like even trivial reasons like not wanting to appear 'cringe'). All these friendships made be realise the impact they all had on me whether that be my personality, interests or just reflections of myself. I just hate how I missed on crucial experiences whilst growing up because I distanced myself. Friendships in adulthood and uni just don’t feel right nor can I make them as easily.

I have no idea why I do this but I hate that I do this. I want to delete my socials but I’d rather not give myself the false hope that if I delete them someone will text me (if you get what I’m trying to say?) I’m not sure how to explain it.

Quick look to the past, I wasnt always lonely. I used to have friends, but them my parents broke up and we started moving from town to town, so i didnt really had to time to make friends, but I always had atleast few people to talk to. Then finally we stayed in town for long enough for me to make friends, even a best friend, but then it went downhill again, my best friend commited suicide and we moved again to a big city, where we would stay atleast long enough for me to finnish high school. I was in 8th grade and I didnt really wanted to make any friends, but the class I went to so was awesome, that they befriended me. I was straight A student that time, so half if class liked me like a person and the other half used me to get better grades. But I was totally socially akward. Then came the day we moved to higb school, I went with my best friend, but he quickly made new friends, and I was rejected from our new class, so we stopped talking, and only time he now texts me is when he needs help with homework, which isnt the best, because me grades dropped to B-C.

So i couldnt make any friends in school, but because I fuck up everything I touch and I suck in all sports, there isnt really another way for me to make friends, my only real hobby is to play games, but there isnt really a space to make friends for me, because I am still shy and socially alward. All the friends from former school stopped texting me, because they made a tons of new friends. Ofcourse I can sometimes talk to my parents when I feel extremely lonely right? Wrong my parents only care for me to have something at home, so i can cook my food and some money to buy cloathing, other wise they dont want to see any signs of me existing, expect of report card that says that I passed another year in school. 

So here I am the kid in the class that sits away from others, you only see in school, because he always stays at home and has no social skills. Without any way or idea how to make friends...

friendships never work out for me. for a while it's great and i get comfortable and allow myself to be happy, but in the end we drift apart and i don't have the courage to try and reconnect, knowing they probably don't want to be friends anymore. it's a frequent pattern in my life, and i've been thinking about it obsessively lately. wondering if maybe, it's just a sign that i'm supposed to be alone.

i don't mind being alone sometimes, but i am permanently lonely due to having no friends, and not being able to make them (for multiple reasons). but because of how all my previous friendships have turned out, i'm wondering if i'm just supposed to be alone, and if i should stop yearning for meaningful relationships and just suck it up and face the truth.

TW: death, violence, birth, sexual assault, attempted OD





I have to quarantine pretty intensely because I have a history of lung surgeries.
I’ve had a falling out with two close friends recently. 
Another friend expressed to me they feel distanced from me because they don’t know how to talk to me with everything I’m going through.
My closest friend is struggling and I need to be there for her more than ever. 
My boyfriend is treating me like I’m mentally ill and irrational for being so sad, so I don’t know how to have a simple conversation with him about my feelings without him trying to read into it more and try to determine “what’s wrong with me”.
Anyways. Here’s where I’m at. 

Before Covid this year:
-4 family members of mine passed away
-I had a falling out with two close friends of mine
-I had a scary work accident where I almost passed out from carbon monoxide poisoning in a walk-in fridge
-I tried to OD on my sleeping pills

After Covid this year:
-I’ve had to stay strictly quarantined because of my lung history, so I’ve felt very isolated
-An activist friend of mine was violently and publicly murdered and has been all over the news 
-I learned that the man who raped me when I was 16 has sexually assaulted atleast 2 other people including a minor 
-I just got back from witnessing my cousin give an all natural at home birth, and then her new baby getting rushed to the hospital because his breathing was too shallow (he’s fine and finally home now, thank god).

I’m emotionally drained and exhausted and I don’t know who to talk to, my mom wants me to “talk to her about my feelings” but then tells me I should really be focusing on the positives, and as I stated earlier, my boyfriend keeps treating me like my feelings are irrational.

I feel lost and so alone, I just don’t know how to process all of this trauma. 

On top of it all I’m a full time University student and the stress is becoming impossible to manage. 

TLDR: Witnessed the very violent and public death of a friend, found out my rapist has raped others, deaths in the family, loss of friendships, work accident, feelings of isolation and not knowing how to process it all and how much more I can handle.",lonely,"I’m trying to process so much trauma, and I feel very emotionally isolated through it all -big vent-",2020-08-16 19:42:56

1456,theworldminusme,1597567940,1," I’m glad we had the discussion. I’m relieved that my intentions weren’t misinterpreted. We have a great friendship and I’ve never wanted more than that.

We(my roommate and I) had been sexually intimate one time over a year ago. It was a threesome with my now ex. Once in a great while we cuddle up while watching a show and I appreciate having that source of physical affection. I guess I assumed that he was still attracted to me physically in some way so about a month ago I finally built up the confidence to casually ask if I could kiss him and he declined but wasn’t very specific. It was bad timing anyway because he was about to go to bed and I didn’t get the chance to really express much. It’s slowly been driving me up the wall wondering if I made him uncomfortable, wondering if I said the wrong thing in the wrong way, etc.

He hasn’t treated me any different since then. I didn’t expect him to because he’s one of my best friends and I’ve always know him to be straight-forward and level headed. Tonight I was able to make myself bring it up once more just to clear the air. To make sure that he understood that I wasn’t trying for a relationship, that I only wanted someone to kiss and I just simply found him physically attractive, etc.

He completely understood and basically explained that he just doesn’t see me in that way. The conversation was lighthearted and we continued joking and making small talk about things afterwards.

I have to admit to myself that I’m hurting from this though. That I can’t help but look at myself in the mirror in disgust. My body-image has been shit lately but now I need to swallow my pride and remind myself that you can’t help who isn’t attracted to you. I feel so unwanted and pathetic and disgusting.

I just want someone to hold me and It feels like I’ll never find someone who sees me “in that way” ever again. I'm trying hard not to let my thoughts spiral like this.

 I need to keep reality in check and analyze why I even approached my friend in this way in the first place. He's familiar, I trust him. Requesting physical affection from him is ten times easier than getting to know someone new. Building trust and trying to form an actual relationship is much more complicated than seeking casual physical affection from a friend.",lonely,"""I just don't see you in that way.""",2020-08-16 18:52:20

I've been homeschooled all my life so I never had many friends it didn't seem like much of a problem to me until recently I think it's mostly because I'm a teenager now but something else is my dad used to spend a lot more time with me, my family got kicked out of our house a few months ago I was never told why, my brother my mom and I moved in with my grandparents my parents are still together but my dad's living across town with his friend and he's working more to try and get us into a better living situation I understand everything that's happening but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Even then my dad has never been the nicest person there's 2 examples of this that stand out to me the first one I think I was around 8 years old I was crying in my bed because I was scared of the dark my dad heard me he walked into the room and start yelling at me ""stop crying"" ""just stop"" ""it's not okay to act like a fucking baby"" and if he heard me start crying again he would come back and do the same thing. the second one I don't remember how old I was maybe 11 or 10 we were driving somewhere and my dad told me that if I wasn't around he would have left my mom and my brother by now and he told me that if I became more like my brother he *would* leave ever since then I felt obligated to not change to not be myself around my dad or anyone besides when I'm alone or with my friend when I'm around him sometimes I make fun of things I like or want to be because he doesn't like them so I can't either I feel like if I'm myself around him he'll just take off one day...
My mom is weird after we move to my grandma's I've never felt worse in my life granted I'm pretty young so that's not saying much but still I started cutting my mom noticed my arm twice the first time I was showing her something on my computer she saw my scars she just said ""what's that?"" I told her idk ""don't do that"" and then she never brought it up again until around 2 months later on Christmas 2019 the interaction was fairly similar after she left to spend the night with my dad I cut myself with the pocket knife my uncle gave me a few hours before ...thx Ryan... I straight up showed my friend my scars he didn't seem to care much I don't know what I expected.
I want to learn to draw, I want to make a webcomic, I have all these ideas and things I want to do I never feel motivated to do anything that would get me closer to those goals everyday just feels like killing time until I can go to bed it's like a break from everything sometimes when I'm trying to sleep start thinking negatively... about everything a lot of what I talked about so far, and every night I fantasize about being cuddled I just want someone to hold me close, and play with my hair, and tell me I'm going to be okay I have the feeling that's going to stay a fantasy.
I don't want to grow up being a teenager is fun and all but it's mostly because I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to take care of myself if I can I'm probably going to live in a shit house, with a shit job, I'm going to be alone, like now but I'll have to work.

It’s funny because she confessed she was jealous of me a while ago cause I was “the prettier and smarter one of us” but she manages to get a boyfriend/guys flirting with her like they fall from the sky. She’s gorgeous definitely but honestly she cheated on her ex several times and lacked remorse and is really hard to tie down.

When I’m older I’m not gonna remember my teenage years, I barley even remember them now honestly. I don’t remember when my feelings of loneliness began, possibly 2018 when all of a sudden I just started thinking negatively and haven’t stopped. I’ve never had a best friend who I can tell anything, who I can spend time with laughing and talking about anything. My friends I was “close” with then I’m not now. 2 of them are in my current group but i don’t talk to friend M because I didn't feel like she valued me as a friend (rightfully so) this I realised last year, same with friend F but I still share a few words with her occasionally. I think my insecurI ties about my sexuality and expressing myself is the reason why I don’t let people in. 

I do have friends but I’m not as close as I could be with them. If I accepted my self earlier maybe I’d be closer to them.

God writing about social shit for me is kinda hard - all these “issues” stem from me not accepting my self sooner. I’d be closer to people and have more confidence if I accepted my sexuality and self identity but I haven’t. I can Invision an alternate dimension where I accepted myself sooner a reality where how I view socialisation is different and it’s not so weird.   


My life isn’t hard at all, it’s easy. I have no issues in life except for my mental health. I could be depressed idk. I think I probably am but I don’t plan on getting diagnosed. Ok so I guess my life is fine, all my issues are in my head. I don’t need to be expressing my thought here but I am.

When I see other people at school I feel like they’ve accepted their identity already. They have lives and friends. And they aren’t struggling with self worth and sexuality but I know that’s not true. Everyone is dealing with something,, I know that but that’s just how I view the world around me. I know life for everyone isn’t perfect but at least they feel comfortable with who they are. I think that’s the most important thing in life, your self worth. Because you see the world around you through your eyes and if you don’t like yourself your gonna view the world negatively.

   
I don’t have a plan for my future career wise but I think after high school I’d like to start working out and eating healthy to try and develop my self-esteem.

ive been writing this for a long time, just thinking about my life, what little of a life I have and how my issues aren’t really issues. I guess struggles would be a more appropriate word. I don’t have issues but I am struggling with my self esteem.   


TLDR 

\- I’m probably depressed because of sexuality and self esteem, lonely bc I don’t open up to people &amp; I keep everything about myself to myself idk if that makes sense

I know reddit hates TikTok and all, but I was part of it at the beginning and seeing that just reminded me of two years ago and I know it’s a really short time but a lot has changed in two years. I remember when I had friends, I had a lot of friends actually. I always get a new group of friends for a couple months or even a year. But for some reason I always separate from the group. Like 4 years ago I had 3 really close friends then all of them moved away(I’m still in school) then I was monkey for a year, just talking to who would talk back to me. Then I got a new friend group that was really bad for me, so I cut them off because they were fucking my school life. Then this past year I was friends with way more people than I’m used to. I even had a girlfriend for a bit, that ended obviously or else I wouldn’t be here. There were like ten people in the group and we were all really close, but then quarantine came and I decided that for a week I was just not gonna talk to anyone, just to see how it went. And no one cared. Then a week became a month. And a month became two months and now I haven’t really talked to a single person outside my family since March. I remember once one of my friends messaged me and ask for a favor, I did it and then he said thanks. I asked if he would add me back to the groupchat(I left during the “one” week) and I got left on seen. While I was I. That friend group, I didn’t see it at the time, but I was actually happy for the first time in a long while. Now none of them will talk to me and I don’t know if I’ll ever talk to them again. I don’t understand the point of making friends if no matter what you stop being friends. What’s the point of it if you could just avoid it all together.

I wish I could just stop being lonely. I don’t know what’s gonna happen when I go back to school, I probably won’t because of corona but still.

I been dealing with this issue for a couple months now, I talk to people attempt being their friend and out of the blue they don't talk to me anymore. I know I'm not perfect but I have very VERY bad social anxiety so even trying online for me is a struggle, I think alot about when I make mistakes, what I'm about to say, what I'm supposed to say, how long do I take to answer, I think about everything. I get attached to people I like talking with easily because it doesn't happen often so when they stoop talking to me I'm heartbroken even though I know it's my mistake.

So I decided that trying to make friends it's not my thing I'm giving up, literally giving up in having real friends that care about me, that laugh at my jokes, that Netflix party with me. I feel alone all the time since about a year ago and I'm getting tired of this, I had a good group of real life friends that were not actually my friends at all even my therapist notice that they were using me bc I have good grades on college and I didn't because I just need people to much.

1489,charstar808,1597547264,1,"First time posting here. I think I just need someone to talk to. 

I moved to a new city after graduating Uni 3 years, I haven’t met many people here and only have one friend I hang out with. She’s super sociable so I don’t get to see her much. I have a roommate but she’s gone to her boyfriends most evenings and weekends. I have two dogs that I adore and I don’t know what I’d do without them. 

I have 3 people I consider to be my best friends but they all live in different cities, they’re also all in relationships and we don’t talk all that much. They’ve been in relationships for a long time and I don’t think they realize how lonely it is being single. 

I do so much for my friends and help them out wherever I can, I often find I don’t get it back though, but I’m okay with that. I was a little hurt because one is getting married and I thought for sure I would be a bridesmaid and she hasn’t asked, it kinda made me feel like maybe she doesn’t value me as much as I value her. Even though when she was having a tough time last year I flew her out to stay with me for a few days. I’m happy to help out, it would just be nice to get some support from them when it feels like the whole world is against me. 

I’ve been single for 7 years, my ex cheated on me and it caused lots of issues for me. I took time to work on myself and build my career but I would trade it all for a loving relationship. I’ve dated a few people throughout the years but it never seems to get to the point where they want to make me their girlfriend. I’ve never had a problem getting laid but decided to stop randomly hooking up because I want something more serious. But really all that’s meant is I haven’t gotten laid for over a year now 😂 

I have a great career making 6 figures, own a house, and have my shit together. Most guys I do end up going out with tell me they’re intimidated by me. The reality of it is that guys don’t want an independent girl, I was recently seeing a guy that said he wanted all that but got pissed at me when I was busy with work and couldn’t speak to him during the day. Yet when he did the same it was no problem.  I’ve been told I’m pretty, I think I have a decent face, I’m a bit overweight, due to thyroid disease, but lift weights a lot and have just ordered a Peloton since my gym still hasn’t reopened. I’ve lost 30 lbs already and am dedicated to losing enough to be happy with my body. I don’t want to be skinny though. 

I focus on my career because I don’t have anyone to share my life with. I’ve had friends tell me in the past that they thought I didn’t want someone and that I just wanted to grow my career. But that’s not it at all. 

There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t see someone announcing a marriage or pregnancy on Facebook/instagram, to the point I barely go on anymore because it makes me so said that it’s not me. 

I feel like everyone is growing up and building their own families and I’m getting left behind. 

I’ll never feel truly successful until I’m happy and  have someone to share my life with, I just don’t know how to get there and why it seems so hard to obtain.

I waited for hours after midnight struck, just hoping for **one** “Happy birthday.” To at least know that I haven’t been forgotten, that someone out there still remembers me or even thinks of me. I spent my birthday alone and in tears. 

My loneliness became extreme months ago after my girlfriend left me. When I lost her, it was like losing my best and only friend. I still love her, but us being close still wasn’t happening, and I’ve been replaced by her friend group. I’ve tried making friends afterwards but it’s hard, and nothing ever works out. It stings even more considering the fact that after our breakup, I still went out of my way and did something special for her for *her* birthday. I just wish something, any tiny bit of appreciation could’ve been reciprocated today. The last person I ever spoke to about any of this, said they would just kill themselves if they were in my position, which is not very reassuring. 

I think at this point I’ve given up on life. I’ll just cry myself to sleep after this.

1500,lonelyguy008,1597542282,1,"Ever since the corona hit, I've been also hit by the realization that I'm completely alone regarding social life. And with that, I'm extremely unhappy and miserable. Nothing I do makes me happy for more than 5minutes.

I just get up, start working at 9, finish with work, eat and then just sit on the computer until 12am hits and go to bed. That's it, that's the only activity I have. I rarely go outside, maybe to buy food or something but without any other purpose.

I've started a new wfh job that pays extremely well and is covering every expense that I have plus leaves me having money on the side. 

The thing is, I don't have any activity to actually use the money for... I've been going to the gym but they are all closed now. Tried going outside to jog and do body training but eventually, my motivation died out.

From recently I've lost touch with my main group of friends, everyone seemed to go on their way when this stupid virus hit. And that was my primary source for socializing. 

I've reached out to other friends but somehow they all have this full schedule and in 5months we hung out only two times.
I've tried calling and texting them but I get rejected all the time with excuses that they don't have time to go out... Or 'we will go out next Sunday', Sunday comes and nothing no call no show. Then I will need to reach out again for eventual reschedule, we will say 'hey beer on Thursday sounds great', Thursday comes and nothing and get all this nonsense 'I couldn't make it', 'We will do it another time I promise' etc etc. Of course if I don't text or write first there won't be any contact from their side which makes me feel unwanted and clingy.

Now the socializing at work is great, albeit we only do video and calls but it's extremely fulfilling until 5 PM hits and everyone shuts off. We laugh we joke but at the end of the day, we are only colleagues and 1. Since I'm new still don't know all the people, and second, they don't want to risk it going out to see each other.

I have hobbies I have stuff to do at home but it isn't fulfilling to me at all, it's like I'm stuck in this insane loop where there is no change at all. I don't have surprises, my schedule is the same every day, I don't have a girlfriend or someone to keep me company.

I'm a 31F and since last week I'm out of a relationship. We had been dating for a few months, lots of at-home dinners and activities due to the virus. I really enjoyed his company and he assured me he felt the same but he was dealing with some personal issues and told me he couldn't handle a relationship. So that was it. 

I'm not angry at him. I understand how self-care is important and he needs to focus on that. What hurts so much is that I'm truly afraid of being alone. I thought by now I would have been in a serious relationship or had a family. I know I'm still young but I don't want to start a family late in life. I know now if I do find a partner, get married, and then focus on kids that it will take time, years realistically.   

I'm the last of my siblings to be married or have a family. I can see the awkwardness on their faces when discussing their spouses, relationship squabbles, and funny kid stories when we get together. The pity in how they talk about why I haven't found someone yet hurts. I don't know why. I've done soul sharing, bettering myself in mental and physical ways, yet I still feel as if there is something wrong with me. 

I don't want to go chasing a partner like some mad woman but I feel like that is where I'm going to be in a few years. While I'm okay being alone with my thoughts I'm not okay with the idea of spending the rest of my life alone. Just to be clear. I don't fear being by myself or doing things on my own. I just don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I don't want to have a child out of wedlock, I'm a realist and know the life I could provide on my own would be poor for a child. I could never purposely have a child just so I wouldn't be on my own. 

How do I deal with these feelings? I don't want to accept the thought that I'll never have a family but as I grow older it's starting to become less of a thought and more of a reality. Is there a therapist out there for these situations? I honestly wish there was a real-life 'Hitch' out there to just tell me what I'm doing wrong. I don't feel that I can tell my family about these feelings without getting more pity or 'band-aid' advice that feels more like trapping a man versus actually finding a partner.

This is my writing for those at critical times in their lives. I will concede that loneliness is a draining emotion. It has physical detrimental health effects that increase mortality rate and make you more prone to some illnesses. ([Source](https://web-b-ebscohost-com.libaccess.sjlibrary.org/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=fee63212-02e2-4c21-a966-317bbda3d1c1%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=94279163&amp;db=a9h), from the Kuzgesagt loneliness video) There are benefits to having a romantic partner in your life. Romantic intimacy filled a gap in my life that nothing else did prior and solved some of my personal issues and helped alleviate others. One example I'm willing to share was that throughout my life I've had constant hand tremors but when I held my SO’s hands it relaxed mine. I'm not saying it’s great to be lonely, but there are times when you want to be alone, and I do.

Solitude Sometimes Is Best Society. I came across this quote recently and it caused me to reflect on myself. While having a relationship did fill gaps in my personal life, it created other problems. Solitude is best society means that sometimes you want to be free from social distractions and demands. There may come a time in someone's life when one needs to be alone in order to focus on oneself. That may be in the form of major life decision and changes to your living situation. Working on building up your career or a startup. In my case I was at a crossroads in my life where I wanted to build up my career and improve myself as an adult. I knew at the time I was not fully mature yet and had a lot of room for personal growth and was explicit about this matter. My relationship at the time however became a reference against which my worth, intentions, and end goal was being judged by. There is room for argument here on how one shouldn’t judge their own worth by their relationship and I fully agree with that. However, when you’re in the middle of a relationship you’re committed to and hear harsh judgement from someone you trust, it becomes difficult to be fully individualistic and throw your partner’s expectations from you away. I tried to meet those expectations which left me in an empty, poor, and unhealthy life. I am writing this on r/lonely so yes, I found out the hard way my partner was not as committed towards me as they expected me to be towards them. 

I’ve been living alone and poor for some time now. At first it was the closest thing to torture or hell I have experienced. I genuinely feel now for anyone who has been chronically alone and does not have much in their lives. It is an unhealthy life that slowly drains your mental health, there is no “manning up” to a life like that, the pain hits different. I still am poor today, but I’ve taken steps to build new dreams for myself and engaged myself more with my surrounding and its improved my mental health. I am alone, and I feel alone. However, I do not want any new relationships for the time being and I’m choosing to continue to be alone. Why? Freedom. I feel free to take my life in any direction I want now. I have another crossroads in my life coming up, but I’m feeling free and am free to follow my new dreams without demands or expectations from social circles. I’m spending my time on work and building up my career skills, without someone shaming me for not giving them enough attention. I’m free to spend my limited money on taking care of myself without someone shaming me I didn’t spend enough on them. I’m free to spend my available mental energy to take care of my own problems without someone guilting me about not giving them enough attention. I am free to live my life independently of any expectations and social obligations towards someone else. I have no stable roots in his life anymore and no solid ground to stand on which is scary, but I’m flexible to take my life in any direction I want. I do not have any obligations to anyone. Solitude sometimes is best society. Having a romantic partner would give me access to someone to seek comfort in, and improve my mental health, but it would also sets demands, expectations, and work to do which I physically do not have the tools, time, and financial resources to meet. A relationship takes effort and right now I would be undercutting my partner and undercutting myself if I try to be in one. So, I am staying alone while working on improving my life and once I have enough to invest in a relationship, I’ll be open again.

I do not intend for this to sound as a praise to loneliness. My days always end with a low mood and feeling lonely as I’m about to sleep. I don’t smile the way I used to before and have lost some of my sense of humor. I do not have any meaningful social circle of friends or family around me and so no one to reach out to for comfort during crisis. My hand tremors have increased due to the amount of stress I am in. My vehicle has stopped working and without the money to fix it I’ve since resorted to alcohol abuse, binge drinking, as a means for escaping from stress. Most of the increase of stress I am in right now however is a direct consequence of being poor however, more than the loneliness. Financial stability and a larger pool of expendable income would help me find safer alternatives for relaxation and comfort, but I’m at least a year away from having that. I hope in a year I’ll be writing a success story. Till my life is in a better place I’ll keep on keeping on, and I hope you whose reading this and gotten this far is will too.",lonely,Solitude Sometimes Is Best Society,2020-08-16 10:03:06

I have had clinical anxiety ever since I was young (26 now) and it has been a major obstacle in my life, constantly ruling my decisions and weighing on my thoughts.

I write this post as a reminder to everyone on here, even if you are a lurker, that self care is very important.

Now this probably sounds like a cliche at surface level but you do not understand how true it really is until you practice self care.

It may be hard normally and even more so now with the current state of the world to keep your mind positive, but I assure you it is always worth the effort. The path to a positive mental attitude is not an easy one and I won't lie but it is achievable by each and every one of you! There is an incredible amount of things that you can do that are proven to help ease stress on the mind...all that is stopping you from trying them is **YOU.**

Hi, I’m a 19yo female from the US (Pacific Northwest). I have a partner, but only one friend who makes time to see me in person about once a month, so I am really isolated and everyone’s else’s absolute last choice. I have been ghosted by so many old friends who claimed to care about me. It has gotten to the point where social interaction is harder to interpret and I mistake neutrality in others for aggression and scrutiny and usually back out of social/friendship progress with other women out of this fear of being secretly hated.

I am tired of living with a brain that is constantly telling me that nefarious intent against me is everywhere: even in my own partner, let alone any other individuals; and it makes it so hard to interact with people because I am literally so terrified and do so much to protect myself every day that it turns people off. and repeating the same habits every day with my depression/ED and isolation is getting me nowhere. 
So that’s me I guess, all I do is work to live, and the leisure time I am privileged to have gets wasted spent in the house, ashamed of my routine of distraction, deprivation, feeling hurt and humiliated.

Hey y’all I’m looking to meet someone I can grow closer with over time. I find it hard to meet new people in person as I don’t leave the house much due to having pretty overwhelming amounts of anxiety. (I’m really selling myself here I know) I’d prefer if you had Snapchat so I know who I’d be talking to, but if you don’t then that’s  fine I guess. I’m very introverted, I like spending time with myself.

I do have one great friend, but she's busy now and I don't see her much :( 

also in January I got out of a horrible abusive relationship, which while I've healed from it mostly, has made it hard with me to trust men and others in general. I want real connections SO BADLY and want others to reciprocate my love, but aside from my one irl friend and my online friends, I just feel isolated. It's also somewhat hard to find people with the same interests (I'm most passionate about music, but like really nerdy music) and just good genuine people with similar mindsets.

I'm 47. I've been married for nearly 20 years. 8 months ago we separated. There's no chance of reconciliation and divorce is pending.

Before marriage I had some friends and a social life. I guess. If always had people around calling themselves friends and all that. Drifted apart over time. I got married and devoted myself to being a family man. Didn't realize that the people who I thought were my friends now are actually her friends. That's that.  Any members of my family pretty much only remember I'm alive when they need something from me (I have a pickup and I can fix things). At Xmas time, I buy my own presents or I'd have nothing under the tree. On my birthday I cook myself my own birthday dinner.  My company had an employee stop by my house (but they did it for every employee) and got a gift of a house plant. I was stunned and so grateful for that small contact (she asked me how I was doing) I wept after when I was alone.

I've come to figure out I'm not great at making friends. I can be friendly and all that, but I quickly find I run out of things to say. I don't do social media things, mainly because I don't want it to take over my time/life as I've seen it do to many others around me. I wouldn't even actually know where to start. Social distancing makes it nearly impossible to meet new people. I smile and say hi when I'm out on walks but it feels awkward.

1534,Nic_Mi,1597518402,1,"Hello, I'm sharing my story as I learned it helps to express feelings rather than keeping the to yourself and obsessing over them.

I'm 33 male, good looking, love to talk, can appear a bit introvert when first meeting someone but then people usually tell me ""for a shy person you talk a lot"" 😄

I've lived in 3 different countries and had to build my social life from scratch each time I moved. 

I was bullied in school, only later I realized how deeply it had affected me and made me feel insecure.

I suffered from social anxiety for years, I could bot go to events, parties when invited, I felt terrified of being in a group of people I didn't know.

I worked on all these issues hard and manage to overcome them. I am not angry about the bullying, I understand it's in kids' nature to pick on the weaker or different ones. I don't have anxiety about going to events on my own. I go to meetup events occasionally and always manage to find someone to talk to.

However, it all ends there. Even if I tried, I couldn't establish a closer connection with any of the people I met. I would reach out in messages, sometimes they'd accept invite for drinks, sometimes not, but it never led to a friendship. 

Some of the people I met through work and made a closer connection with, over time distanced themselves and we grew apart. 

As a liberal straight guy, I was open to both genders and lifestyles when it comes to friends. But two gay guys I met separately only stayed in touch while they thought something might happen between us. Once they realized this was off the table, they left. One expectedly told me so, the other just disappeared so I rationalized it like this.

All of this has taken a huge hit at my already low self confidence. Sometimes I feel like giving up and just being on my own all the time. But after a while, it doesn't feel natural.

And as I move towards mid thirties I fear I might miss the last train towards normal social life.",lonely,As we get older...,2020-08-16 05:06:42

1536,FirstGalerian,1597516772,1,"Forgive me for rambling...

&amp;#x200B;

Today I woke up, again. Damn. For 5 hours I didn't know pain, I wasn't lonely, I wasn't anything. Now I sit here, at my job and wait to go home to do the same exact thing, wait in a small cramped room. I cannot go anywhere. I cannot talk to anyone. I want to cry but as a man I shouldn't do any of that. I am so utterly unhappy and alone, I am going to break soon I can feel it, I am so very scared and lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to walk into the embrace of a partner I will never have. I want to be loved by another and feel complete but I will never find that person because they simply do not exist for me. I need to be loved so badly it hurts, not the I love you way the I am in love with you way. ""Just wait you'll find your soulmate one day!"" I am so very tired of hearing that. What is she magically going to poof into existence? I don't think you understand, I don't think you can. It just doesn't work that way, do you even know what you are saying? ""nothing ventured nothing gained"" true but after repeated failure I am not a gambling man. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you talk to me I will try to converse with you but it will end up with me just staring, awkwardly fidgeting and pacing because I don't have anything to say and I'm sorry. I'm not uninterested in you, I literally do not know what to tell you to keep a conversation going because I don't have anything to talk about. I'm sorry... I'm not being awkward because I want to be, I'm just socially crippled. 

&amp;#x200B;

My confidence lies in ruins. Nothing interests me anymore so I am not interesting to another. I am no looker so I don't have that to garner any attention. Honestly I am average at the best of times, solid 3 out of 10, 4 if I push it. I can understand why I am alone, I wouldn't want to be with me either. I don't like this negative feeling, ideas. I don't like this ache inside of myself, so very empty and lonely and longing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember how my pawpaw held my grandmother, the love in their eyes when they looked at each other. That was love... Nothing I've ever had comes close... I want that too... I wish I never tasted the affection of another then I would not crave it as deeply as I do. I could not miss what I never had, if I ever truly had it at all... If there is a god in his heaven he is surely laughing at me. I am so utterly pathetic, I just want to take away every single persons feelings of loneliness and depression and then disappear forever.",lonely,When everyday is the same,2020-08-16 04:39:32

1542,SallyFace617,1597509951,1,"All my life, I’ve been bending over backwards for other people. Doing my best to be nice to them and be a good friend and helpful person. I’ve been neglecting myself in favor of them. I remember when I was in elementary school I had a bunch of “friends” but they weren’t really my friends. They always ignored me when I tried to talk, never wanted to do anything I wanted to do, and i never felt a real connection to them. They only ever really treated me like friends when I had something to give them. But they were the only friends I had and likely the only friends Id ever get, so I kept hanging out with them. I played the games they wanted to play, talked about what they wanted to talk about, and basically let them walk all over me because it was better than being lonely. In 2nd grade I was always the babysitter, and if I was lucky the pet, when we played house. In 3rd grade I listened to them talk about memes and kickball and their dogs and stuff while I just wanted someone to be interested in my Beanie Boo collection. In 4th grade i was never invited to any birthday parties except the ones their parents made them invite everyone to, and it was clear they were having too much fun with the other guests to have time to hang out with me. And in 5th grade, everyone talked about James Charles or Fortnite or how fun 6th grade was gonna be and thought I was weird for liking FNaF and Legend of Zelda. When I moved to a new school for middle school and started 6th grade, I thought it was gonna be a fresh start. But can you guess what happened? Yeah, Its all the same. I get ignored and walked all over again. People were nicer to me at my new school, but it was clear they thought I was weird and for some, annoying. And all they ever wanted to talk about was anime, music, bands, and more anime. I was just left there in the corner thinking about rpg maker games and stuff while everyone else ignored me. I was always picked last for group projects. Now I’m about to go back for another year. It’s hard to go back to someplace you were never welcome at. I looked toward the internet for solace, but even then finding friends was hard and my bad social skills bled into my internet personalities. I ended up getting harassed and doxxed by a group of internet jerks, and these 4 people came to help me out. Only 4, but to me it was like the whole world came over to help me in that time. I ended up being really good friends with two of them, but I always felt I never added much to their conversations. And then the worst thing in the world happened. One of the people who helped me out decided he was jealous of all the time me and his friend spent together, and decided to tell his friend some lies about how me and my other friend were awful people who were lying behind his back. He also made him say a bunch of really awful stuff to me, like calling me a whore and telling me to kill myself, because if he didn’t the liar would stop being friends with him. I ended up having to block him and his friend.

1560,s1nc0st4n,1597498363,1,"So, this is another story I made from a previous post on the subreddit. It isn't a sequel or anything, just a story I made today. It also fits for a challenge, which is to use the same sentence at the start and the end. Here it is:

“It’s okay. It’s not that hard.”

The voice reverberates around the endless black void, travelling further and further until it fades out of existence. I look around me, all I see is complete darkness. This wasn’t where I thought I would be.

“Seriously, it’s very simple. One swift slice and it’s all over.”

I look down at my hand. The metal of the razor blade shines back at me, showing nothing but cold. Slight tears form in my eyes. “I don’t want to do this.” I tell myself. “I don’t want to do this. I don’t nee-“

“I can hear you, Emily. Stop trying to persuade yourself. This is the best course of action.”

I finally see the source of the ominous voice. It’s me. It’s a reflection of me, shown in a mirror endlessly spanning beyond what I can perceive. But it’s mangled, amalgamated, with stone cold eyes and a darker shade.

“Listen, if you do this, everything will be fine. It’s a win-win; you get what you want, and everyone else gets what they have always wanted. For you to leave, and never return.”

“But I love my family and friends. Sure, I worry sometimes, and have problems of my own, but that doesn’t mean I should do this. If I’m sad, they always come and comfort me, right?”

The reflection just sighs.

“You may love them or whatever, but trust me, they just want you gone. You should be thankful I’m here, I’m just telling the truth. This is what you want, and what they want.”

“But-“

“Just think back. Have you ever really felt any kind of friendship with the people you love, or how your friends think of your sore excuse of a human? And ooh, what about your mum, huh? How did it feel to lose her? And wow, how could I forget about all the times you’ve lost it and ruined other people? Everyone’s just putting on a costume to try and make you go away, but you keep leeching on them.”

“Please-“

“They think you’re shit. Everyone does. You’re just a nuisance to everyone, with no hope or future. The little insignificant hope you have is spent wastefully on nothing. You are just worthless, this is why you are here in the first place; to end your pitiful existence and save everyone a ton of baggage. I bet everyone is going to be so much more peaceful when you-“

**“STOP!”**

My yell is unheard over the loud ringing in my ears. My heart throbs and pounds my ears, and my entire body feels as if it’s collapsing. I look back at the razor blade again. My eyes have turned pained and fearful, and beads of sweat form all over. My knuckles are white from clenching the razor blade with fear. The reflection is right. I mean look at me right now, I’m helpless and lost, just insignificant, like everyone thinks. No-one needs me.

“So, after that, you still going to try to argue with me for no reason? Or are you going to just comply and make the right choice, finally?”

I look back. The reflection is back to where it was at the start, still amalgamated and twisted. It’s eyes almost look comforting, as if they are supporting me during this.

“Yeah, I’m ready. You’re right, what’s the point of going on if I don’t have anything to go to?”

“Good choice.”

I take one last look back at the blade. It’s quite beautiful actually, I can perfectly see my now peaceful eyes. I’m glad that I’ve finally realised this. Everyone will be happy.

The blade feels cold against my neck, and it feels nice, like an ice pack. I look back at the reflection, it’s smiling now, ready to watch the show. It feels nice to have someone that understands me, and can make the right decisions for me in moments like these. I look back at the blade against my neck.

And then notice something I’m wearing.

It’s a necklace. It’s chained metal wires are looped around my neck, and in front of me is a quartz crystal. I remembered where it came from; I was given it on my birthday, by one of my best friends. He and my other friends had saved up all holiday to get it for me, and I absolutely loved it.

I remembered the times during recess and lunch when me and my friends would go to the oval to play chasey and tell each other stories. I remembered when we would always chat during geography instead of focusing on the task, like we should have. I remembered the times when they told me about the bad things in their life and how I would help them. I remembered when we would laugh and laugh watching videos during sleepovers.

But most of all, I remembered that they would always support me when I felt down.

I took the razor blade off my neck. I smile, but not like I was before. It was an actual, genuine smile, made by the memories I’ve shared. That was close; I was foggy and clouded for a bit, but now I’m back, and better than ever.

“What are you doing? Why are you taking the razor blade away; you should have been gone by now.”

My footsteps echo abound as I start to walk towards the mirror. The reflection looks confused as to what I’m doing, but he still seems as if he’s in control. We both start to walk towards each other.

“Why are you coming to me? Just do the job already.”

The mirror grows bigger and bigger, stretching beyond my field of vision left and right, before I’m face-to-face with myself. The mirror feels cold against my hand. I knew what I had to do.

“I’m not going to let you control me anymore.” I say. “I may not be anything special. I may not be smart or pretty, I may not be as much as I would like to be, but one thing I know I am, and that I’m glad I am, is that I’m happy. I’m happy that I have such loving friends and family. I’m happy that I can share my feelings and stories with people. I’m happy I’m the way I am.”

“Do I really have to explain this to you again? You’re tricking yourself. The stories you tell are just stupid, and no-one cares. Come on, spilling cordial on a plate isn’t entertaining.”

“Well it must have been in some way, because everyone was crying out of laughter after I told that story. All I have to say is this, I know what you are. I’m glad to have met you; I’ve needed to take care of you for a while, and now I’ve finally built up the courage to do so. It’s time for me to challenge myself.”

The reflection doesn’t respond, instead just confused and irritated, waiting for what I’m about to say next. But what I do next isn’t with words.

I look at the razor blade in my hands one more time. Hopefully it will be strong enough.

I slam the razor blade against the mirror, making a huge clang and causing cracks in the surface.

**“WHAT ARE YOU DOING?** THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE YOU KNOW!”

I ignore the voice, slamming against the mirror again, causing more cracks.

“WHY WON’T YOU LISTEN TO ME? THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT!”

The voice becomes a garble as I continue to slam against the mirror over and over again. I hear my heart beat rapidly in my ears, and beads of sweat collect in my eyes. The cracks scatter across the mirror, and the clashes keep getting louder and louder. I can see the reflection telling me to stop, but I continue, knowing that I have needed to do this for a long time.

I go to swing again, but instead only my hand slams against the mirror. The razor blade broke. I didn’t think that would happen, but it didn’t stop me. I continued to break the mirror with my bare hands; cracks spread across the mirror and shards of glass grazed my arms. My heart was pumping like crazy and my breathing was rapid, but I kept on going.

The cracks started to stretch beyond my peripheral vision, after what seemed like days. I took a step back, seeing the damage I had created. It would only take one more slam.

“What have you done? Do you even realise what you have DONE?”

I just smile at the reflection, it’s eyes showing pure rage.

“I’m just doing what I should have done a long time ago. Now it’s time to finish that.”

I step back up to the mirror, drawing my arm back for one final hit.

“DON’T!”

The voice is ignored as I punch the mirror with all my might. The entire mirror shatters completely as my hand reaches through to the other side. Shards of glass fall endlessly like rain. The reflection is gone. I’ve conquered myself. I’m free.

I look around me again. Instead, I see white marble walls reflecting my face back to me. I see the sink and the shower, and the bath I am sitting in. I look back to my hand. The razor blade is back, sitting in my palm, ready for whatever it was made for. I slowly put it down beside me, listening to the clang as it hits the ground of the bath.

“Emily! Are you okay! Are you safe!”

I hear knocking at the locked door. It’s Maddy, my best friend, the one that organised giving me the necklace, which was currently looped around my neck.

I get up and go to the door. I can still hear the loud banging and her cries of fear as to what I have done. When I open the door, she immediately stops and sees my smile. Tears form in the corners of her eyes. She sprints up to me and gives me the biggest hug I’ve even been delivered.

“Emily! Oh my god, are you okay?”

She squeezes me with so much force I can barely whisper the words:

It was like a whole new sense I discovered something I'd never experienced before.
We both live in hostels, she frequently went to her home.. so I'm the first 3 months of our relationship we were together for around 40 days, she was madly in love with me I could feel it too.. I just got too much attatched to her and then Covid-19 hit  our country so because of the lockdown I haven't seen her for more 5 months now. She's suffering from depression and every time she had a hard time I made sure to be on her side.. I have her space when she needed.. then she kept saying she didn't deserve me for the last few months and yesterday she texted me she's not in love with me anymore, she thinks we lost the spark, our relationship lacked passion. She said she can't remember the feeling of us being together. I tried convincing her that's If I could call her and we could talk about it, she said she can't talk to me on call .. From the time I've heard all this I just can't believe it ... It's like someone who's died but you can't convince yourself that it's possible.

1584,nategrate98,1597468081,1,"I really just need some good vibes from y’all tonight if possible. For reference my brother and his finance had a falling out with me after I left my mother’s house. My mother is a very emotionally and mentally manipulative person and I had enough one day and walked out. That was two years ago and thankfully me and my mother are on speaking terms again but in new relationship terms. Basically I took control of that relationship cause my mother was not handling it properly, unfortunately. 

My brother’s finance took issue with this since my brother had similar issues and he chose not to leave my mother high and dry like I did. My brother’s finance thought I was the reason to blame as well for the discord between me and my mother. She should have took her opinion right up her ass but that’s besides the point. My brother still holds some resentment towards me for all this. 

The same “not good enough for me” feeling that I get from woman is the current feeling I’m experiencing from my brother, and I truly do not feel good enough for most people. No matter how hard I work it just seems like those who I desire intimate relationships will always remain unsatisfied with progress in my life. They reject me for issues with my mother, taunt me with my low amount income, and cringe at the fact I live with my grandmother. I’m sorry I’m only 22 and got a late start I’m just trying to make the best of a bad situation.

I’ve had to completely overhaul my personality for woman to even be slightly attracted me and why I do like a lot of the characteristics about the new me, the stress of not being able to keep personality traits that I liked for the sake of progress is immensely stressful.

I have good relationships with friends and other family members such as my grandmother and my Dad but it just seems like everyone I desire is expecting more. It feels like some sort of unshakable curse. 

Does this all even matter? Will I actually be able to engage myself in the types of  intimate relationships I want? I truly doubt it.

I’m not sure where this belongs maybe here because I’m feeling lonely, maybe no one reads it and it’s at the bottom of the barrel. I’ve always been an outgoing, socialist person, never questioned who was around me so long as we got along, never cared for what you looked like, as long as we had a level of real in between, I hopped from girlfriend to girlfriend, job to job, always searching a piece of happiness, going around lost searching for some unknown answer. Everyone around me seems to be on a level of something I can’t obtain, sure I own a business, my daughter now lives with me, but I am not happy. Or some days I am, the most part is I find myself getting up on the weekend really early and just driving, I’ve driven two states non stop just on the road feeling everything. One time I drove 350 miles to catch the ocean, just myself and tunes I could sing and relate to. I deleted all my “social” media awhile ago, Facebook and Instagram and whatever else I had, then about a few weeks later I realized no one checked up on me, not one call or text, I figured “don’t ask questions you don’t want the answer to”, because I knew right away no one would. But some part of me hoped someone would. I walked into a life again, with a seldom and sobering feeling that this “feeling” I’m feeling, whatever you want to describe it as, was sentimental. I find myself beginning to love who I am, and damn it be a lonely Ss road, but worth it. I find myself carrying myself, telling myself I’m worth it, I’m this and that. I’m enough for anyone. It no one sees then I know I got me. Gods got my back. For those who are just down right lonely, searching, wondering, you got everything you will ever need inside of you. I know depression hurts, men and women, i know heartache and finical problems drain your souls. I know it all hurts, there’s a million people just like us, and a million more that are going through a lot more too. We’re all family, we just forgot how to love.

Of course when they're in the office they can't game or skype so a limited option would be to message me.  Earlier something was said about them still wanting some sort of nudes of me, but I shut it down and since then I asked them a question to which they responded and then they haven't tried to talk to me since because once again they were busy gaming with friends.

Online friends are complicated, yes more complicated than irl friends, but online friends are easier to get. Despite this, perhaps it’s because it’s easy to find someone else to talk or perhaps there are other reasons people leave unsaid as well, but truth is that people treat you like you’re disposable, after a year of been lurking these sort of subreddits I’ve learned that with most online friends you gotta enjoy the here and now, and we all know that sorta has its perks and its downsides, so I propose you to enjoy our here and now, but don’t get me wrong that doesn’t mean I don’t want anything long term, I’d love something long term, I just think it’s difficult to get, I’m always looking for a good friend. This time I’ll try to be as detailed as I can about what I’m looking for, I want a friendship in which we can both rant and talk about anything really, no limits, that’s the idea, someone to confide and rely in, something nice. Now I’ll specify some facts about me you might like: 

1 - I describe myself as a kind and nice person, also funny, to a point ironic. Some have described me as up front cause I always say what I’m feeling, whether that’s good or bad. 

2 - I like to read a lot, books like ASOIAF, The picture of Dorian Gray, or The Exorcist 😱. 

3 - I love voice calling, please make sure you do too. I would also like if you could help me sounding more native, I’d appreciate it, cause I’m working on my English accent. I can also help you with the other languages I speak but you’ll have to message me and ask me which ones I know. 

4 - I love my pets, they are my life, I’ll spam you with pics if you want, you’ll see how cute they are.  

5 - I don’t discriminate, you can be any race, religion, or sexuality, so yeah no way I’d  discriminate any of you, I just ask for the same, no racism please. 

6 - I speak three languages, as you can tell English is one of them, hit me up to know the two other ones.  

7 - My interests are at the moment are listening to music, reading, but most of all talking to all the people I meet online everyday. I also used to play the piano, now I dropped it but I still like classical music, as well as other genres. 

So we’ve come to the end of my post, probably I’ll get very few responses cause I’m a guy (I hope not) but if you got here, I thank you, and please send me a message. Anyone is welcome. Have a good day or night, see you buddy.

P.S please try to answer with more than just a hi or hey, just tell me your age gender and where you’re from.",lonely,"[19M] If you appreciate respectful honesty, read this. [Friendship]",2020-08-15 13:12:32

1602,robbieisrotten,1597460337,1,"My mom and step dad go to the same restaurant every weekend. I used to go with them all the time but I stopped going for the same reasons that I was reminded about tonight. It was my step dad’s birthday and I don’t have friends that want to hangout with me on a Friday night, so I said why not and went. It was the same as before. They’re close with the staff and since it’s a Spanish restaurant they do the whole trying to speak Spanish thing. My 28 year old step brother came too. The three of them talked the whole time I hardly said anything. When I tried to say something I was ignored or given a quick “yeah” which I’m used to, I’m not an interesting person. So I just sat there. 

They got drunk. I’m not old enough to drink but I have no interest in drinking anyway. Because when I was a teenager I slowly watched my father become an alcoholic and it played a part into why he passed. They got wild and I just sat there watching the cars go by. The waiters would come up and laugh with the three of them and I just sat there, I felt invisible. What they were laughing about wasn’t even funny to me, really bland old people humor. 

We were there for 4 hours and it was awful. Anytime there was a lull in conversation they’d whip out there phones while I just sat there. I don’t really go on my phone much, I don’t have texts to respond to. I hate going on Instagram. Idk why I even have a phone really. It’s dryer than a desert. I just sat there looking at my water and was in my head. I looked at the couples and happy people eating and my depression started to come in. 

Probably the biggest reason I don’t go with them is because my mom and step dad dirty text each other from across he table. They’re so obvious about it idk how they don’t realize it. They did it tonight and it was awful. It makes me so uncomfortable. Now I have to listen to them fuck from across the house. Incredibly thin walls gang. I put on a record to try and drown it out. 

When it was finally time to leave I realized why they wanted me to come. So I could drive home. That’s the only reason they invited me. They knew in the back of their heads they could get drunk and not worry bc I came. I said probably 30 words during the whole 4 hours. 

Now I’m home. Depression swelling. I just feel so alone. So invisible. I don’t feel wanted. I don’t feel loved. I haven’t felt love since my parents divorce before my dad passed. I just want someone to really care about me. I want someone to hug me and tell me it’s okay. I’m so touch starved. I just want a girl or even a random person to ask me if I’m okay and eventually love me. But I’ve accepted something like that doesn’t happen for people like me. Ugly, short, cripplingly socially anxious, self hating, depressed people. It’s not like the movies, some random girl won’t notice and ask what’s wrong. I’ll be alone for these last few years of my life. It won’t get better.

1606,paczki-ghost,1597459457,1,"I have spent the past 7 years of my life working towards higher education (I'm currently a rising junior in hs). I have dedicated almost every second of my life, in some way, to academics and personal achievements that I usually only pursue because I know they'd look good on a college application. I am miserable. I have developed severe depression and anxiety, and for various other reasons I also have trust issues that make it difficult for me to want to talk to a therapist, or anyone else for that matter, to let out my frustrations and overwhelming stress. I take over ten classes a school year and have been doing this for about 4 years now. To clarify, we have 9 periods a school day, including lunch. I have to overlap classes and go out of my way to get my schedule personalized by hand so I can cram-pack my life with work. I never really believed I was pushing myself too hard, in fact, I still think I could do so much more, and every second I spend not doing academics or something educational, I feel hollow and disappointed in myself. I maintain high grades and memberships in various extracurriculars but my psyche is still really messed up by now, especially considering that I've been in the honors program since the second grade, and never took a breather. My work makes me feel whole, temporarily, and provides a comfortable distraction, with the ultimate dream of going to an Ivy like Harvard or Princeton keeping me sustained and ""on the right path"".  I haven't stopped this dangerous cycle of overworking myself because of the constant praise I get. Teachers love me, my parents are oh-so proud of me, but I feel like I am nothing without academics and empty, generic praise. Throughout this almost-decade-long period of nonstop stress, I have, quite predictably, lost alot in the meantime, including my passions for reading and the arts, my own health, countless friends, and my mental health (most noticeably). 

Currently, I have a small friend group of about 8 people, but I only talk to 3 or 4 of them, and only 1 regularly. Now, part of the reason I don't have many friends is because I am afraid of making friends. I am afraid of being anything less than perfect and losing friends because of that. I have also been backstabbed many times in other friend groups and have had countless people talk about me behind my back, about ungrounded claims and general messages of hate. Among the 3 or 4 people I talk to, I only feel comfortable openly speaking to two of them, and the other two make me feel invalidated (I tell myself this is my fault, however, and this feeling is probably a result of my own anxiety, but my point remains). Recently, while trying to fix up my broken friendships as a result of the pandemic and my natural inclination to become a recluse and avoid all contact with the outside world, I prepared long messages explaining my feelings towards a couple of these people (predictably, I sent these messages to the 2 people I'm okay with openly speaking with). However, the 1 person among these 2 who I have regularly been talking to, on an almost-daily basis since the beginning of the pandemic, has been responding to me less often than before. I may be paranoid, and I probably am, but they've been active on other apps we are friends on, like IG, TikTok, and Spotify, but still wait over 12 hours after I text them to respond to me, all the while being active within that time frame on other said apps. I really need validation from people, if that wasn't obvious enough from my other paragraph, and the lack of correspondence and effort from the 4 people I am friends with makes me incredibly insecure and irrationally saddened. Because of my work ethic (which is far from *ethical*), maintaining relationships is incredibly emotionally draining and can be physically draining as well, if we are to hang out in person. I like having friends, and I do genuinely like these 4 people, and I dedicate all of my extra time and resources to them (no, I am not exaggerating, I honestly do), give them letters and gifts, share music with them (music is incredibly dear to me and heavily emotional), and go out of my way to ensure the stability of our friendship, but I cannot remember the last time any of these people have come to me with the prospect of hanging out or starting a conversation. It hurts, and its been years since I have felt a mutually beneficial and completely equal relationship with anyone. 

Sorry if the later paragraph is hard to decipher and all over the place, but my emotions regarding my friendships (and lack thereof) is incredibly more complicated and the road to me feeling this way has been about 2 or 3 years long at this point, so there would be ALOT to get into, If i were to totally diagnose everything piece by piece. Also, I'm terribly sorry for how long this is, and I have totally neglected to point out that my work and my friendships have left me very obviously - ***lonely.*** I am not necessarily alone at all, but I feel like there is no-one there for me and that I have to do absolutely everything in the company of myself. Regardless of any praise I receive, I never actually get help from anyone and very rarely does anyone seem genuinely concerned about my visibly deteriorating wellbeing. And I have a hard time approaching people myself because I am afraid to admit I cannot keep doing everything alone, and I cannot stand being so lonely anymore.

I am not shy and I don't have any problems with talking, joking and even superficially flirting with girls I meet, however I've always been alone.

The one girl that ever showed interest in me wasn't ready to commit and treated me very badly and having had *something* with her means nothing to me now except memories of how I was during that time and it hurts so much how much better I liked myself and how happy I was, when right now I'm far from it.

And the main problem is: I don't know why. I just can't understand why that's never been a part of my life and if it is how I look: I can't change that. That leads me to fearing that this will never change, that I will always be alone and unloved. Always fall asleep alone and wake up alone.

I'm currently working a 4x10 schedule and today is the beginning of my 4 day work week. I work a job that often times has a lot of down time between tasks. The majority of my day is spent working on my computer and booking a lot of appointments and filing paperwork. The rest is either spent taking inbound calls, or making outbound calls. Luckily, I'm able to have at least one headphone in through my day, so music helps. 

I'd love to have someone to talk to throughout the day. The boredom that comes from just sitting at a desk all day is the biggest struggle. I'd love to spend my free time getting to know someone on a personal level. I'm an open book and incredibly hard to offend haha. I'm open to pretty much any topic and will pretty much answer any questions you have. 
The biggest plus in my book is having a good library of music. Music is everything to me and I love finding new artists every day. Please send me any suggestions that you have as I'll have plenty of time to check them out throughout my day :)

When I transitioned I was finally at peace with who I am on the inside, socially I was disowned by family &amp; “friends” lost my job &amp; even got violently attacked walking home one night.

I accepted that I am a freak by societies standards, I knew when I transitioned the price was that no one would ever love me, after all love is only for normal people. I accepted that the only people who would be sexually attracted to me would be chasers who would objectify me &amp; fetishise me, whilst never giving me basic respect. 

I moved states to a progressive town &amp; I’ve never had a relationship, I haven’t had sex in 11 years, I can’t even remember how it feels to be penetrated, I remember I liked it.

I’m fully passable, I look normal &amp; no one has misgendered or taken a second glance at me in a decade. I’m not what could be considered hot, I’m not ugly either, I’m just bland &amp; forgettable.

Men have occasionally made a move, but I never reciprocate, cause I know if they knew they would probably hurt me one way or another.

I have a pretty meaningful life, I have 2 jobs, I’m studying a degree in data analytics part time, I have many hobbies including dance, cooking, bushwalking I even write erotic fiction(mostly my unfulfilled fantasies. I’m also a hopeless romantic, I love romance films &amp; novels &amp; all the cheesy stuff, although I prefer romantic tragedies, I think deep down I can’t imagine a life without tragedy.

So to get some perspective on my loneliness, I want to know what it is that you believe is the reason for your lonely feeling? People who really know to the core what it is. For example: if ''this'' was fixed, I wouldn't be lonely anymore.   


I see 80% of the people talking about love and having a Girlfriend or Boyfriend. Having a GF or BF does not always help your loneliness. I know that for a fact.   


I am asking this as I tried so many things to fix my issue. Relationships, living abroad, getting out of my comfort zone, making new friends. But I keep feeling emptiness and uncertainty about my life, leaving me with a very lonely feeling. For the first time in my life, I don't know what to do anymore to find the source to this feeling.

The first makes me not see at night or any low lighting. I can't bike or drive.
The second makes me can't consume ay alcohol or smoke.

I always knew that I can't see well but I was in denial. Before knowing the medical details I used to deny/overlook it by guess what? Drinking a lot. :D
Especially when I needed to go out at night, I always drank. That's how I overcome the anxiety of tripping all the time and bumping or walking right into people because I can't see them.


Now that I know this I'm off smoking/alcohol for 8 months, I'm super depressed.

Without any drugs/alcohol I feel so sad all the time and I don't go out at night at all which fucked up my social life.

Add to that I just moved to France for a new job that pays very well but I don't speak French. I don't have any friends here and we work from home because of covid.

On top of the social anxiety, body dysmorphia, lack of confidence*, and poor social skills, I can't make friends because of French as well.

*I forgot to mention I also have mild back scoliosis lol, I'm always arching my back and shoulders forward in an unattractive way. Along with the vision thing I can't play 90% of sports.

So basically I stay at home all day to avoid being more sad by interacting with people.

I mean I love my job and I live in a very fancy flat and I'm making money which is amazing given that I was raised up poor so I feel like I shouldn't complain.

But now I feel so lonely and I don't see any prospects of dating soon. I can't go out on dates at night for god sake.

1679,runtokevinnn,1597391682,1,"Hey all,

I'm 26(M), and I've just recently went through a break up (about 2 weeks ago), which meant my ex SO moved out of my apartment and left me there all by myself. 

The thing is, a couple of months ago I moved into my own place, and she moved in there with me. It was a lovely idea at first, us living together, but it soon turned into a nightmare filled with screaming matches, so the breakup was inevitable to say the least. 

Besides that, I've also been repositioned at my work. My company opened a new office (approximately 1 hour drive from the HQ) and they put me there. They told me I'd be in charge of a small team here one day, but until then, I'm all alone. 

I've got an apartment that was meant to be for 2 people, but I'm alone there. I have an office that could hold at least 4 people in here, but I'm alone here, too. I drive alone in my car to work and back home, I go alone to the store, I cook alone, I eat alone,... even at my work during lunch hours, I go out and eat/sit all by myself. 

Don't get me wrong, I've got some hobbies (rock climbing, video games, hiking, reading, writing, YT, Reddit,..) but it feels like they just don't feel ""the void"".  Also, I've got some good friends, but I can't really rely on them day in day out. I guess I should get used to being ""all alone"", face it, embrace it, and actually love it. It just feels scary, I guess.

I'm a 22 year old, gay male with absolutely zero friends. At all. I broke down at work one day in June, and since then, my mental health has just deteriorated in regards to this matter. I have severe social anxiety, and I don't go out, and I hate it. 


I feel like a burden on everyone, I could never ask someone if they wanted to do anything through fear of rejection, or if they say yes, the thought that they didn't actually want to, or they did it out of sympathy.

At that point, I understand that they don’t know I exist. They dont know anything about me or my issues and have no real reason to be invested in them.

1692,JonColwell,1597381653,1,"So this is an update to my original story that I posted a month ago that you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/hrwmrf/my_first_relationship_in_nine_years_only_lasted_a/) 

 I'm not gonna lie to you, I kept up with her social media from time to time. About a week or two ago, she tweeted ""I don't have a reason to cry, I just need to."" and then the day after on Instagram she added a photo of the mountains that we live around and wrote ""As much as I love these mountains, I wanna get away"" Then a few days after that, she posted on Her Instagram Story (Though I didn't view it, I seen it in the previews) a picture of her bare legs with the caption above it saying ""Just fuck me up"" I seen that and was shocked. A day or two after that, she posted her bare legs again on her story, this time in the bathtub with the caption ""Enjoying a nice little soak in the tub."" I went a good while without seeing her social media until I looked on her Twitter this Past Wednesday and seen [this](https://imgur.com/a/Mt9KKhY). I didn't know what to think. I was felt with feelings of anger, hurt, and confusion. Three weeks after we broke up, she decides to get into a relationship with another guy. How fucking dare her. I was the best thing that ever came into her life and she was too blind and scared to even notice that. 

Ever since I found all of this out, everything makes sense now. Her becoming distant, sending the giant breakup message, and removing me off all of her social media. She did it because more than likely she was talking to somebody else while we were dating, got bored of our relationship, and got out of it to try something new. She removed me because she didn't want me to see that and get even more hurt, but what's even the point? That's my best guess, but I could always be wrong. It's just fucked that here she is dating someone else in just three weeks of leaving me. Who the fuck even does that?

There's no doubt in my mind that she's gonna have that ""birthday sex"" that she's been craving recently given that her birthday is Saturday. I wouldn't be in the least bit shocked. She lied so much to me.

I thought she was a real good girl. My soulmate. She even said to me that I was her person and that she could feel it and she wanted to have me forever. How in the fuck can you use such strong words to lie with? Those are too strong of words to use for lying. 

My first relationship in nine years, it lasts for a week, and then three weeks later she's into a relationship with somebody else. I really just feel like saying fuck it and giving up on love altogether. Every single time I get into a relationship with a girl, it always lasts short and they break it off with me either by cheating or getting into another relationship. Am I really that boring of a guy? Is it myself or the girl at fault? Sometimes I don't even try because of where I'm 26 and still a virgin, still live with my mom, no license, car, job (can't get one due to my asthma and the pandemic), and I've always struggled with low self esteem and rejection. I can't find a way to learn how to drive because My Mom's car has a lot of problems and she can't teach me in that, and we're currently unable to afford another car or have someone else teach me, and also rent is sky high for my area when it comes to an apartment so I can't live on my own. I do help my mom out around the house though, but honestly, I don't think a good girl would want a guy like me where I don't look presentable and look dependent. So I don't even try sometimes because of that thought. Maybe it's my mindset and thinking that is the problem. All I know is that I'm a human like everybody else, and a good hearted man. I deserve to have love, compassion, and intimacy just as much as anybody else. I'm sure whoever this new guy she's dating is probably very promiscuous, and is very independent. She and any other girl would take that over top of a guy like me any day.     

Maybe I'm supposed to be alone for the rest of my life. Who knows? What I do know is that I'm not going on her social media anymore. I can't take no more of that honestly. That was enough. It gets really fucking old having to constantly go through heartache, bad outcomes, and unrequited love. I just feel hopeless and accepting that things never will change for me. 

I just want to meet a good girl out there. There's got to be some, or at least one that feels the way that I do. Maybe that's just my own thinking making me try to feel good, but I sure hope not. I just wanna cross paths with a girl that will really give a fuck about my as much as I give a fuck about them. 

Maybe I'm just too pure and beautiful for this world.",lonely,An update on things,2020-08-14 15:07:33

Confession time, reddit. I tend to check all your profiles, sorry if that's creepy... I don't feel any better doing it. But am paranoid and secretive and hide my own account because I fear. Am afraid that you'll get the wrong idea... hypocritical much? You betcha.

I just like seeing what some of you like. And if we like the same thing... well, a normal -- no, a socially adjusted person or someone with a healthy self-esteem (would not try and hide to begin with) but he might just try talk to you. Reach out. But I can't do the toddler talk. I can't say ""hey, let's be friends!"" Because friendship takes time... it takes equal effort. Two ways street... to just decide to be a friend one day just like that...

Cringy. Maybe...

Or maybe it's my needs. I have baggage. Baggage that once tried to kill me (Suicidal-like). I am not the best person for me. And my former friends were horrible. And my extended family did me few favors... so I have a lot. A lot of baggage. And I know that THAT may drive everyone away.

Those subs that are for people looking for a friend terrify me, beyond what I can honestly say. I don't think my self esteem could take the hit of being ignored or mocked. Or worse, acquaintance-zoned; patent pending. 

If I'd like to be friends. I'll wait. Be patient. I'll stalk you a bit. Sorry, I'm just shy like that. I'll wait for you to comment on something that I can comment about... and I'd be all paranoid. But then I'll comment to you, hoping that you'll be willing, that you'll talk with ne...

I want her to tell me things she wouldn't tell other people, or plan out for us to go places together whether it's just her and me or our group of friends altogether. There are so many things I want to do with her. She makes me feel so happy, just speaking to her can be the highlight of my day.. it's insane. I've been lonely all my life and all I ever wanted was one close friend and yet anytime I got anywhere near that they would just drift away somehow. It has happened twice before and I'm scared it'll happen again. I feel like it already is. 

No matter how much I try to get closer with her or speak to her it just doesn't feel right. Like, she speaks with me a lot and we are actually pretty good friends. The problem honestly is me. Whenever I see her speaking with other people, looking as if she's having a much better time, I just get so jealous. I begin to feel worthless, and not enough. Why am I never enough? I always go out of my way to do the most in trying to make her happy, yet my effort seems to go in vain. She appreciates it all, but it feels wrong. I feel like the way she looks at me, she just sees a ""really kind friend"" and not someone special. 

What hurt the most is that today we (along with our group) were planning to do something all together. We have been planning this for a week now. We agreed to finally do it after 8 today, but she didn't show up. Instead she was with other people. Only I found out about this though and I've cried about it already. 

This group of mine, especially her.. they all make me so happy, yet so lonely at the same time. I don't know what to do. This is the first time I've ever felt so... so badly depressed. It's like I'm trapped in this endless loop where I find someone, I get attached, and it just never works. I don't even know if this is the correct sub. I just feel.. really lonely.

1748,cchickendawgg,1597353281,1,"All my life I've been really lonely. My classmates hate me, spread rumors about me, talk about me behind my back while still pretending to be my friend, classic stuff. I have two close friends (let's call them Friend 1 and Friend 2 for the sake of clarity) who mean the world for me but are 3 years older and in different high schools so I barely see them, maybe 4 or 5 times a year for Friend 1, almost never for Friend 2. I'm nice to people, I barely lose my temper, and will always forgive others no matter how much it hurts.

 I've known Friend 3 for 9 years now. We've only became friends 2 years ago. She'd (used) to do anything for me, call out people for being mean to me, joke and tell each other secrets, but that's about it. After some reflection, I realized that I'm the one who checks in on her, asks how's she's doing, offers to help with things but I never get that same love back. I should've taken that as a red flag earlier. I give her space, talk to her every 2-3 days.  

Recently, she's started ignoring my DMs and always saying she's busy when I ask her to hang out. She's constantly posting about this one girl on social media, let's call her Joyce.  Joyce hasn't been the nicest to me, she left me on seen when I wished her a happy birthday, gives me subtle hints that she doesn't like me although I haven't said or done anything to her other than talked to her with Friend 4 once. Friend 4 always comments tons of stuff under her posts and goes out with her constantly but never has the time to talk to me. I guess I've been replaced, from what I can tell. 

At school, girls are constantly trying to start drama and deleting me from their following lists, DMing me just to leave me on seen, and just generally being shitty people. I am getting really anxious about going back to school because I know that now that Friend 4 is gone, nobody will be there to support me and I'm completely on my own against a class full of boys and girls dealing with hormones and removing their anger on me.

Finding new friends outside of school is almost impossible, I've developed *really* bad social anxiety in the past few years and I cry at the thought of talking to a stranger or anyone I haven't known since I was little. This also eliminates the option of moving to a new school. I honestly have no clue on what to do. I feel like crying. A lot. I don't know if I'll ever find someone to talk to; I'm just really scared I'll be lonely for the rest of my life. Please, if anyone has advice I'd be unbelievably grateful for it.",lonely,"I don't know what to do anymore, I'm really scared",2020-08-14 07:14:41

-I can't make a meaningful connection with anyone, because I'm incapable of talking about my own feelings or life.The only person I would consider an actual friend is my drug dealer, but I'm unable to tell if he's just using me or if he actually cares about me.
-I've buried almost every detail of my life except for a few specific moments, which I can't deny because of witnesses. 
-I suppress my desires because I hate asking for handouts or help. This has led me to ask for nothing on my birthday or Christmas since I was 7.
-I started using Reddit 4 years ago but didn't post because I was afraid of judgement.  
-Most of my life is concentrated on making other people happy or proud, not myself.
-I lie about my life and my mental state to prove to my parents that their marriage was not a mistake.
- I want to be happy, but I don't know how. In the back of my mind, I feel like asking strangers about my personal problems is part of my issue. I don't trust myself enough.

About a year ago I moved to another part of Greece for uni. There three months in I meet a girl through a common friend of ours, we talked a little and found out we have a lot in common. After that we stopped talking for 2 months but then I went on a trip with some friends and she was there too I still didn't know if I liked her or not then but as we talked and were spending time together I couldn't get my eyes off hers. After the trip we grew really close to eachother until I learned she was bisexual and more attracted to other girls ( I do not have a problem with that I totally support her ) so every hope I had shattered. However after 15-17 days she told me she liked me and would like it if something happened between us this made my heart explode. Unfortunately after that the lockdown happened and I was away in my hometown nowhere close to her for two months after the confession, I am back however and for the past two months we've been close again but i don't get the same vibes from her and I think she's no longer interested which sucks because the longer I talked to her the harder I fell for her and I'm now stuck madly in love with her but I don't know if I can tell her. 


TL;Dr 
I love a girl, we were separated for 2 months she's bisexual with an attraction to women and I'm not sure if I should tell her how I feel or if that's going to push her away because the last 3 male relationships she had didn't last over a month.",lonely,Love (again),2020-08-14 02:10:49

1800,NoOneElseToCall,1597308520,1,"So a bit of context: I recently broke up with my girlfriend of almost three years, who I lived with, and moved back in with my family. The breakup was my fault, and the fallout from it has been weighing on me massively - to the point where I've had some pretty serious suicidal thoughts (even wrote a hypothetical goodbye note at one point). I know that sounds dramatic over just a breakup, but it's more to do with feeling like I'm an inherently bad and toxic person and not believing I'm worthy of living.

Because the relationship I was previously in was pretty all-encompassing, I fell out of touch with a lot of the friends I had - and some self-destructive behaviour burned bridges with a number of others over time. As a result, I only really have one person (aside from my family) who I feel that I can talk to about this - my best friend, who I've known since I was 3. 

He's living a pretty great life right now, pandemic notwithstanding. He's a teacher, so he's still employed and it's the summer holidays so he's making the most of them. Active social life, like I used to have, involved with a really nice woman and is always keeping busy. We arranged for him to come and visit me for a few days whilst my family are away on a camping holiday. Because of that, I decided not to go with them. But my friend has been really shit at replying and now I'm not sure he'll make it at all - at least not during the next week.

That leaves me in a situation where my family are about to leave, I can't join them because someone has to look after the cat and it's too late to take her to a cattery, and I don't really know who I can talk to. Based on how awful I've felt at various points since I moved back here, and how much I've come to relish my family's company, I'm worried about getting through the next week.

He can tell I’m upset even though I brush it off and it makes him feel guilty and that’s not fair at all. So I’ve decided I need to tell him what I’m feeling but I also don’t know if it’s fair to feel so lonely when I have him.

Most people I know would probably describe me as confident. but I'm very selective about who I spend my time with. I grew up lonely, we didn't have many kids in my area. I got used to my own company. I've lived alone since I was 16 and recently moved into a house with 2 friends but I've realized that I still feel alone. I never feel a connection with anyone anymore. I love my friends but they just feel like people I know. I'm too up tight and closed off. I don't even feel close to my best friend anymore. I still love them like I used too but somehow I don't actually FEEL the same connection. Most of the time I want people to leave me alone and I often dream about living totally isolated in a cabin some place. I'd just spend my days laboring enough that I get tired and can't fall asleep at night. but no mans an island. I realize I'm the problem. Plenty of people seem to like me and wanna be my friend but I just cant feel a connection with anyone anymore. 

Sometimes I think a relationship would be nice. but I know that I wouldn't really feel any affection for the person. It would just be a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship. and that would make me feel worse. It would make me feel fake and hollow. So as much as id like the human contact I dont bother because i know its not worth it.

 The people i'm closest to are really just people I either used to have a connection with or people who I really want a connection with. but it never happens anymore. I know I want friends because every time I get a message I get excited for a second. It makes me feel wanted. I'm not really sure why I'm here, I guess I'd like to make some new friends, get some messages in my inbox to give me a little excitement when I see the notification. but it feels nice just to type it out and know that someone will read it and understand.

I met a girl online who I got inlove with, I thought that was it, we had so much in common, I had never been so happy before, I had one of my best practises the day she told me ""have a nice practise love"" (in Portuguese made more sense) the first time she called me that, I had never felt so good in my life, and never felt like that again, even though i thought we were meant to be together, and I still think that and think about her to this day, she was 2 years older than me, she went to a different school and we started to talk less and less to a point where she got a boyfriend and a few months later she had become a lesbian, I got really hurt with this since I thought she was the one, and started taking to a girl from my team who I didn't know liked me at the time, after a few weeks I started to fall in love with her and we started dating, I never felt the same as I did with the first girl I talked, I never found that degree of happiness again.

Fast forward 6 months the second girl breaks up with me, and there I was back to the beginning, shy to talk to people because she was always there and didn't want to be around her, but there was a girl who was like a best friend to me, she always came to me to talk about her crushes and stuff and she helped me a lot in that breakup even though she was my ex's best friend.
Then the summer holidays arrived and that girl who was like a best friend left, she didn't want to practise any more, and this time, after I lost her, I was really alone, I became extremely introverted once again, I went full practises without talking to no one, I had really lost every one on my life. Fast forward a few months I started talking more to people, but only in a trying to be funny way, so that they could like me, unfortunately the only way I could do that was in a self-mocking way, and even then I had no one, they laughed and when they had the chance they would get into groups and leave me.

And now that we are on the summer I see that I am really alone, my school ""friends"" go every week to the beach and have never invited me, I am white af, I haven't gone to the beach this year, my swimming ""friends"" are just girls who get in the girls group and leave me out as well and I stay at home seeing all the pictures and thinking how everything went wrong even though I was the happiest I had ever been. I have no one but myself and it hits the hardest when I am alone at home, thinking about how happy I would have been with that first girl if we went to the same school or if we had met, I miss going to bed with a smile.

1884,Black_Knights321,1597261674,1,"A month ago, I've gotten a call from my doctor about my blood work, and she told me that I had chronic kidney failure. While she was in the middle of talking about me coming in for treatment, I just hung up the phone. Of course I was shocked to hear the news, but at the same time, I feel kind of relieve. 

I'm honestly just tired of being in this world. I just accepted that there's no one in my life that never really gave a shit about me. All through my childhood, I was always abused by both of my parents and most of my older siblings. On top of that, all while I was relentlessly bullied all throughout school. I was always by myself with nobody having any interest in getting to know me. Don't even get me started on dating, I'm practically invisible to women. And honestly, who can blame them? It's gonna take a unicorn of a girl to stomach looking at my face for any long periods of time. Honestly for a while, I was hanging around incels because I actually found a group where I felt like I belonged to. Not like I was ever included in anything else. 

I've been alone in this world for so long, that I eventually got extremely depressed and suicidal because of it. There were previous times where I've tried taking my own life but failed to do so. And all those attempts landed me in the mental hospital for months in between admissions. As much as I wanted to just end it all, I had to accept the fact that I just don't have the heart to off myself. 

Now I have a chance to leave this world peacefully. I'm refusing to get treatment for my illness in hopes it will just take me out of this world. I've been alive for 21 years and I have nothing to show for it. No friends, no girlfriend, no major accomplishments, nothing. I'll be leaving nothing behind to prove that I existed. Now I'm just coping with things that I like to do until this illness inevitably takes me out.

1887,lshhh94,1597260344,1,"One of my biggest insecurities is having trouble making and keeping friendships and its starting to get me down. I am a big introvert and suffer anxiety with bouts of depression which started when I moved away to university. I tried to stay in touch with my group of friends from school but many seemed disinterested in talking to me unless I could visit home and go to clubs. This was always something I was never a huge fan of but did to see friends but during uni I suffered financially and couldn't afford this. It especially hurt deeply that my best friend (or who i thought was my best friend) stopped contacting me because of this, even meeting up when i was visiting home.

This made it harder to make friends at uni too but i made a couple friends which was nice and had a long term relationship too which made me feel less lonely. Since moving back home and starting a masters degree, only one friend from uni kept in touch with me and we see eachother once or twice a year. I had tried to get back in touch with an old friend from school and we saw eachother a couple times but she would stand me up frequently to the point where I gave up on the friendship.

I have since found it increasingly hitting my self esteem and making it so much harder to make friends. I made two new friends last year online that I ended up meeting in person as theyre from where I live but I only meet up with them every so often due to work or study commitments, but recently they seem to have been less bothered about talking to me or meeting up, and then I see them on social media hanging out with big groups of people they call their friends and although I am happy they have that, it makes me feel left out and I often wish I was closer to them or had someone other than my SO to call a best friend.

I really value female friendship and not having that connection other than a text here and there makes me feel distant and lonely. I worry that it is me, have I said something? am I not fun enough because im introverted? Previous friendships at school i was often walked all over because I was the quiet one or shy and then I started standing up for myself and distancing from those that did this or made me feel uncomfortable for being introverted. But it seems I cant strike a balance. When I am out with others, i feel I cant fully be myself because of this.

On top of this, I am starting a teaching degree in a few weeks to become a science teacher and while I have come out my shell a lot since being a shy school kid, I always worry I am overlooked or belittled because I am naturally quieter and softly spoken. I always worry what they will think and that hinders my confidence.

She did call me at midnight. We spoke for a long time. We also video called and it was the first time in my life I've video called. I thought it would be awkward for me because I'm introverted but I felt really comfortable because it was her. She also told me I looked very excited. 

I then told her that this was the first time anyone had wished me at midnight and if it had been anybody else I wouldn't have been this happy; but since it was her I was really really happy about it. I told her at 2 am that this is easily my favorite birthday of these 21 years, even though only two hours had passed. She told that she didn't know that it meant so much to me. She promised that she'd call me every year from now on.

I was so happy she had called that even after we were done speaking I couldn't sleep. I was so excited. It took me a long time to fall asleep.

And yes, even though she did call me, the bigger problem is still there. Like many in the comments told me, my moods depend on her in an unhealthy way, almost to the point that it looks like I'm obsessed with her. This is very dangerous especially when she's already made up her mind about me and so I don't really have any hope. I'm also going to give up trying to be a closer friend to her, because I've tried a lot and nothing worked and it always left me in a bad mood. I don't deserve to go through that. I do love her and I have to understand boundaries and be the best friend she needs me to be. Yeah, this whole thing has been sad but it's not her fault or my fault. It's not in my control. It is what it is.

And so I'm going to try to move on and stop thinking about her constantly (I know easier said than done). Like many people suggested, I'm going to try and keep myself busy, talk to other people, etc. Whatever it is that is going to help me. 

I'm also planning on seeking professional help once I graduate (in a few months), because I've felt lonely and passively suicidal for so many years now and I don't think without professional help I can get a long term solution. She's also been telling me to get professional help for a long time now and I promised her that I will once I graduate.

So hopefully, at least temporarily I can make things better and treat myself better.

And once again, thank you to everyone who responded.",lonely,[UPDATE] It's my [20M] birthday tomorrow and I know what I'm going to be doing tonight,2020-08-12 23:48:28

I've always felt a bit out of place with my peers. Probably because I had responsibilities at a young age that I shouldn't have. So I guess that's why I'm here.

- Cooking (Expect many pictures)
- Reading (No not ebooks) 
- Listening to podcast ( Sucker for crime and    mysteries)

1911,HiperactividadMental,1597235648,1,"I've always been a very independent person who thinks she doesn't need anybody. But I'm starting to feel alone and tired because of a few things: a year ago I broke a 7 year old friendship because we didn't understand each other and this made me walk away from some friends. I also disappointed a special guy few months ago, and I feel a lot of guilt that he even appears in my dreams. And I can't fix it because he has met someone else. But it's better that way, I'm not the best kind of person for him.

So I tried to take refuge in other people and meet new guys, but it hasn't worked. In addition, I argued with my parents a lot during the quarantine (but now the relationship is okay again). They want to move to another city because my father found a stable job and we've a relative who cannot stay alone due to health problems, so I tried to convince her to come with us but she doesn't want to. So the option I thought was to repeat the grade that I was studying and take care of her, but my parents refused and I had a lot of arguments because of this, to the point where I left home several times (I went to my grandmother's house). 

And my best friend, who I happily spent most of the summer with, is on vacation, so I won't see her until September. Fortunately, I still have a friend to talk with on WhatsApp, although I haven't seen him for a long time because he's from other place.

I try to eat well, do sports, sleep and reorder my life (because I also have harmful habits that I must stop doing). I don't want to be weak, victimizing myself or be a snowflake, but it's hard to keep myself stable. There are days where I don't feel anything and I'm the coldest person on earth and there are anothers where I feel a deep sadness and my emotions are overflowing. I feel like I've lost everything at only 18 years old.

1923,Lone-Wolf___,1597225816,1,"Remember that people who are shy and antisocial in their teen years and maybe even in college, are usually the ones that become most successful in life later on. You know Mark Zuckerberg the founder of facebook, Bill Gates or Microsoft, and Steve Jobs of Apple, were all the same introverted antisocial type of kids that many of us are as well, they didn’t have many friends and were made fun of by the popular kids for being loners/losers/virgins/nerds,etc. and only having a few friends at most, but look at them now. Another thing that’s worth considering imo is that all 3 of them dropped out of college by around their 2nd year or so, so it kinda shows how everyday common people usually go the conventional college and then 9-5 work route after graduating college, but the people who are extra-ordinary tend to not like college for obvious reasons, it’s not a good environment for ppl like u &amp; me who are antisocial and don’t like doing drugs, partying, getting drunk, and catching STDs, bcuz we usually are capable of being way more successful without college and many of us that are like this realize that college is not right for us bcuz we don’t really fit in and getting a degree would be a pointless waste of time, effort, &amp; money, for many of us that are like this, because odds are we will probably be just as successful without it than we would be if we were to waste our time, effort, and money on getting a useless degree, 90% of degrees r useless and the 10% that are worth getting like computer science are usually made way harder to get by the university to make it more competitive so I don’t blame many ppl like us for wanting to drop out and pursue a smarter route, there actually are good paying jobs u can get with vocational training or an associates degree from community college which is way more useful than a bachelors degree in gender studies or some BS, I used to be like most ppl in the sense that I used to look down on others who I heard dropped out of college but not anymore, a friend of mine dropped out of college and opened up his own business and ended up becoming super successful more than 99% of college graduates. One final note, the popular kids that made fun of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill gates, and Steve Jobs, probably all ended up working for them in the future, lol, can u imagine the kid u used to make fun of ended up being your boss or being the founder of the company u work for now? Haha, well, as u can tell, yes I too have decided to pursue entrepreneurship, I’m 20 years old currently, wish me luck, or don’t, doesn’t matter, I’m still gonna win regardless of whether or not u wish me luck or not, it’s not like I’ve had any support from anyone before, I come from a broken, abusive, and poor family but I’m determined to claw my way up to the top all on my own, and you can too if u can relate to my story, my best advise I can give u all is this: think outside the box, do research online, seek out knowledge from others who are experts in entrepreneurship, remember there are ppl who have already made it who u can learn from, big hint, improving our lives are in our own hands, no one else is gonna do it for us, we have to improve our own lives ourselves, I hope that I could inspire many of you out there who are lonely and depressed just like I used to be, who are reading this, if I can do it, then you can to. I’ve already begun my journey in entrepreneurship and as of right now things are looking good for me, that’s why I’ll say if one more time, if I can do it, then so can you, never give up, good luck, and god bless, I personally believe he is watching over all of us that are suffering, I personally would not have been able to make it this far without God in my life, he has always been my one and only source of support in this world. ☪️",lonely,Never be ashamed of the fact that you are alone.,2020-08-12 19:50:16
1924,InitialDistribution,1597224121,1,"I used to think it was my fault that opening up about my struggles /depression/anxiety did not help me. Everyone always says 'talking helps' but this is definitely not the case IMO. I tried really hard talking with my parents and friends about my problems but I feel misunderstood.

 With my parents I dont want them to know all the shit Im experiencing, and thparent-child dynamic makes it very hard for me. With my friend I always have to request duch a conversation which makes it feel like they arent even willing to talk about it and care about it in the first place. They never share anything about their emotions and are too scared to actually show initiative in my emotional well being. Ive commented on this before and said this has hurt me in the past but I feel like nothing has changed. The few times I took the initiative in trying to open up I can see them getting uncomfortable and shut down and its not relieving for me anymore.

 Ive been in therapy gor 3 years now and all the time Ive been longing for just one person with which I can share all my struggles, without having to pay someone money for it because its their job. I crave someone who cares about me. I crave that human connection. 

Fortunately, I went to a talk group thing volunteered by people 2 weeks ago. I talked to 2 volunteers my age, and I have never felt so relieved and carried in a conversation.
At the beginning of the conversation I immediately broke down in a sort of panic attack. When I came back to my senses I told them everything that was on my mind. We talked about selfharm, sexuality, depression, loneliness. Alot of the things I told they could relate to, which was made me feel so validated. Once what I was saying was real and recognized. They were so understanding and I could finally really cry and share my pain with them and they carried it beautifully.

I live alone and have no friends, I mean, those friends who can not only share positive emotions, but also negative emotions. I always try to avoid talking about my concerns and emotions to others bc I don’t like complaining and I feel like it will make others think I’m “weak”. I also don’t share those bad emotions with my family cuz I don’t want them to worry about me—I always just say “I’m good.””I’m living well.” with big smile on FaceTime so that my mom will not worry about me. I’d rather to let my heart break instead of letting her heart break.

  But I’m just a normal person. I also need outlets for my feelings. I barely can keep motivated after being rejected by recruiters for several times just because I’m a foreigner. The most cruel thing for me is that I have to keep positive and passionate. My family has been spending too much money for supporting me. It’s really expensive to study and live here. I remind myself almost everyday that I should study hard and find a good job so that I can stop asking my family for money. My parents never require me to “pay them back in the future” or “you must find a good job/you must earn great grades”. They just want me to be happy, healthy and safe. But I feel guilty everyday to use their money since I already 23 years old and still cannot find even a good internship to make money by myself. Sometimes I want to take a break and tell myself “Zoey, you should have a rest. It’s okay to slow your steps. It’s okay if you cannot find a good internship or a job.” but the anxiety will cane me severely to push me forward. Especially every time when I saw my classmates or friends received offers from our dream companies, my anxiety just breaks out like volcanoes. 

  Honestly, I don’t know what I should do. I used to think about leave this world but I know my mom will be sad. I don’t wanna make her sad. And I don’t wanna make myself sad either. I feel like there is no dopamine in my brain anymore, and there is no motivation in my life anymore, too. 

  Please forgive my grammar errors and basic languages. I’m really thankful no matter whether there is anyone reading my complaint or not. It makes me feel better to type my deep emotions out.

When i went like a month straight without seeing anyone during quarantine, i felt the most fulfilled and self sufficient ive felt in a long time.
Now I’ve fallen back into this hole of loneliness. I feel like I’m obsessed, I spend every fucking minute of my life obsessing over whoever I’m obsessed with (and who doesn’t care about me at all), and sometimes fucking other random guys to try to get over the other guy. I never get a text after. They act like I don’t exist for at least like two weeks after. I know I should just be alone and on my own, I know. Everyone tells me this all the time. But sex is the easiest way to feel love and attention. I like being cuddled to sleep and waking up next to someone in the morning. Those moments are getting me through shit. This is all even harder during quarantine, my job hasn’t accepted people back so im just sitting around not doing shit. I’m like productive 1 or 2 hours of the day and then im out of luck.

1958,pandaalone,1597199907,1,"Family do things without me randomly &amp; seemingly gaslight me after

Family leave me out of some things randomly &amp; seemingly gaslight me after

I have three relatives who I am very close to. By that I mean extremely close. We have done everything together our whole life, &amp; nowadays we talk everyday &amp; always do lots of things together. The three relatives are biologically closer to eachother than me but through their own initiative we have always been a lifelong established “group”. I am an only child with no children so I am pretty “alone” in terms of family &amp; in our culture family is huge so this also plays a big part in treating me as one of them. Something which has been reiterated time &amp; time again over our lifetime. 

In the last year I went through a life changing trauma &amp; this cemented their “We are always here for you, you’re not alone, we’re your family, you’re one of us” relationship with me. 

We’re in our own WhatsApp group where we talk everyday &amp; by everyday I mean ALL day long, every single day. Sometimes sharing even every hour of our day if it’s that kind of day. We share our whole day, photos, videos, voice notes, everything. We could literally not be closer. 

So recently it’s really taken me aback &amp; hurt me when they’ve been doing things without me. Little trips locally or further out that I could easily have joined them with. They disappear off the WhatsApp group where they would be talking till that moment &amp; theon post all about it on their social media. Then they return on the group to carry on chatting normally acting like nothing has happened, they don’t mention the trip at all &amp; don’t send photos of it or anything. Occasionally one of them will just casually say “I’ve been to the &lt;location&gt; &amp; so tired”. 

They had done this a few times before my traumatic event but it felt like they would never do anything like that again the way they were with &amp; certainly in the months proceeding they actively included me in every little thing. 

I feel incredibly awkward &amp; almost humiliated when they do this. We all live locally to each other, the places are usually just public parks or events that anyone can turn up to &amp; their plans are usually just very casual. I have my own car so I could make my own way. In fact only one of them drives so when her car is full due to her kids &amp; any extra people coming I am often the one taking the other two to lots of things without ever taking money for petrol - basically being the person who makes it possible for them to go to all these things. And I generally do lots for them all in terms of being there for them, helping them with anything they ever need, actively playing a role in their children’s lives &amp; doing countless favours - as you do naturally with people you’re close to.

It’s more puzzling &amp; confusing because sometimes they *do* include me whole heartedly &amp; I feel like we’re so incredibly close those times. And they’ll also invite me to more personal &amp; private things at their house or life events where they won’t invite anyone else further cementing the “You’re one of us” relationship. Sometimes we’ll just have spent that kind of day or evening together &amp; then the next day or two later they will do this disappearing act on me. 

Yesterday they did it again, we were avidly talking on WhatsApp until then, then I found out through looking at their social media stories they had gone to a local country park. I was doing nothing &amp; they basically drove past my house to go. It was more upsetting &amp; embarrassing because I actually saw them on the road when they were returning (I was in the car going the opposite way) but they didn’t see me. I mentioned it as a joke on our WhatsApp group that I saw them on road (I didn’t mention their trip) &amp; they were driving so fast that they must have been really hungry. They replied laughing at what I saw &amp; said yes they actually were really hungry. No acknowledgement of their trip at all &amp; then continued to talk normally about things in the group the rest of the evening.

It makes me feel really strange, confused &amp; awkward. And yes hurt.

My friend was into the other girl way more so i decided to start talking to this one. She’s cute and funny and has a nice personality and can carry on a good conversation. At this point she’s been talking to me for close to 2 weeks not a long time and she asks me if I knew my friend and how well and then she drops the news on me she likes him. I felt a bit defeated inside and I wasn’t sure what to do, I could’ve told her he’s seeing someone else at the same time or I could’ve made him seem like a good guy in her eyes and I did the latter . Anyways she asks me about him and I enlighten her and glorify him to her.

People have known me to be a cheerful and jolly person. Making people happy makes me happy. I always make sure I’m available for my family and friends. Me and my best friend started a small food business last 2018 from scratch. 

Until the pandemic happened.

We lost our business. Our plans for the business extension all went to trash. We’ve been on lockdown since March and with the incompetent government that we have, I’m not even sure until when the lockdown will last and until when the economy will suffer. Me and my best friend lost our source of income. I don’t want to disturb my IRL friends because they’re also experiencing their own battles.

My brother’s subtly saying that I’m stupid due to my business closing (me and my brother are not close, we can exist for months without us talking to each other). My family hasn’t been the most supportive in my struggles. I’m having problems physically (with my skin) and emotionally. I have questioned a lot of people and things, including myself and my religion, for all the things happening. I never thought I would be in this position right now. In a snap, I feel like I lost everything. Sometimes I would cry myself to sleep asking myself when all these things would end. I feel like I’m in a bad dream but I can’t wake up.

At 27 years old, life is the direct product of a past which is often difficult to look back on. My inner struggle is that of low self esteem, anxiety, depression, and a misunderstanding of how I am viewed by others in relation to how I see myself through my own eyes.

Honestly, stagnation like feet entrenched in water, moving in slow motion is how I exist. How has it come to be that I am at a dead end job, have never had a girlfriend, have never had sex sober, and feel so estranged from what it is to be a man? DO you ever feel like a character in someone else's movie? Life circumstances have me feeling like there is an invisible force that's translucent yet ever present, barricading my human form from various experiences and states of being that everyone around me seems to so naturally achieve. Sometimes, I get the sense that I am almost inhuman or cursed to a life outside looking in. Maybe it's better to explain it like a ghost looking on just outside the reaches of the human dimension. Even better, like an alien observing a populace for the first time in which their norms and experiences are not yours yet they feel so native and yet out of reach.The only way for anyone to get a better picture is for me to summarize my major life experiences. Maybe someone will relate to this or offer some incite. 

When I was five, my sister, brother, and I came down with the E-coli virus. I was five, my brother was eight, and my sister was three. My sister was rushed to a major clinic and was in a life and death situation for nine months. I was later rushed to the same clinic and was able to fight it off in a week because I was older. I then went home and was raised by my grandmother for nine months. When my sister finally made a recovery, sadly my mother had not. She was a shell of herself suffering from ptsd. My sister went down to thirteen pounds and her respiratory system and kidneys had failed. The doctors proclaimed it as a miracle. Basically, the whole situation took a huge toll on my mother. As a result, my grandmother moved in with us because my mom could not function. Meanwhile, my dad was busy running a business and coming home to a wife with problems he didn't get and could not fix. He also has anger problems so there was yelling and lots of crying.

Fast forward a year and I'm in first grade suffering from anxiety especially separation anxiety from my mom. However, I end up having a pretty normal childhood with the exception of a few bad periods. 

***Middle School***

I was much bigger than everyone else and started shaving in sixth grade. Also, I was very athletic in basketball, football, track, soccer, and others. In seventh grade it was apparent that I was the best athlete in the grade and I even had a full thick beard believe it or not. All the while, I was suffering from anxiety yet high functioning. In eight grade I broke the long jump record with 18.6 feet at 14. Also, I ran for 28 tds in football in seven games and over 2,000 yards. However, I was pretty shy around girls especially but was popular and social. I remember getting a lot of attention from girls but I found it hard to pursue them.

***High School***

I was switched to quarterback freshman year and I was informed that I would be brought up to varsity the next year to start at qb and also in basketball to start at forward. I was told this at a time when my anxiety was getting bad and I essentially had a mental breakdown during the football season. I lost 30 plus pounds and suffered from constant panic attacks. I somehow finished the season and the school year but I was done with sports and this caused tons of problems with my parents and family who wanted me to play. every day friends, teachers, girls, and other people would ask me why I was quitting sports? I come from a small town in which football is everything lol. I started smoking weed and gained a decent amount of weight. All throught high school, I never got attention from girls and I had such low self esteem that I almost never tried to form a relationship.

***College***

I went to a small state school 2 hours away and roomed with 3 good friends from high school. We were very social and drank a lot. However, only had sex three times in 5 years with two girls I had zero attraction to. I was hammered for every attempt. Fast forward to 2017, I graduated with a shit degree and moved back to my hometown and started working for the family business. This is when I started to actually try to date. I went on a decent amount of dates that never went anywhere and have been ghosted and stood up too many times to count. It has been an absolute nightmare. To make it worse, people are constantly telling me, you are handsome, funny, smart, and nice, how come you never have a girl? I never have an answer for them. I have put in considerable effort and have lowered my standards so low that people close to me can't believe I would even talk to some of these women even though they reject me every time. All the while, family members and friends keep suggesting I go after women who are really beautiful. I look at them like they are crazy because they don't get that literally all women reject me except a few who were literally morbidly obese and extremely clingy. One girl who contacted me was actually mentally slow. I'm not trying to be mean I'm just being honest. 

It's come to the point where family is begging me to try [match.com](https://match.com) or e-harmony lol. All dating apps have failed and I even have showed friends, family, my sister, female friends, and cousins conversations I have had with women and they always say, I see nothing that you are doing wrong. All of this has made my depression and anxiety worse. I am to the point where I want to quit because when 99 percent are rejections and the few that aren't end up being the dreaded, you're nice but I don't feel that way about you. My grandma literally thinks this is all a plan from god to make me a priest haha. I have posted pictures of myself on reddit and people 95 percent of responders tell me I am good looking and that it must be my personality. This makes me even more confised because if I was very obviously ugly, I could accept this failure more easily. At this point I'm just rambling. Sorry for the long post.

1971,oldatheart515,1597195272,1,"I’ve always been my own person, but it leaves me lonely in a lot of ways. 

My own mother has called me “eccentric.” I guess I should embrace the label, but when I think of “eccentric,” I think of crazy and slightly unstable people. 

“Old at heart” is my way of describing myself. I’m 28, but I love music, television, movies, literature, personalities, décor, cars, and most everything from before I was born – particularly from the period from 1955 to 1975. I’ve been that way all my life. 

I’m a straight male, but I detest sports, hunting, fishing, and most other traditionally masculine pursuits you could name – I’m strictly a humanities person. That has never endeared me to other men. I find women infinitely more interesting than men, in every possible way.  

I had no close friends until I was almost 25 years old. Now I do have some very good friends, all co-workers, but they are married women who range from almost ten to almost forty years older than me. We get together often outside of work. It sometimes deeply saddens me when I realize that, at the end of the day, they always get to go home to somebody; I get to go home to a dark, empty house, like Scrooge.

I was engaged once. My only romantic relationship. She was older than me by only nine months. We met at work. I almost gave up everything for her. I moved in with her. I thought she was “the one,” and she did her very best to convince me of it. But she was really quite deeply troubled and terminally dishonest. When I eventually found out the extent of her issues, I had to get out. I was with her two years. 

I crave romance again, but I also fear giving so much of myself up once more only to be devastated. Also, since I’m no prize looks-wise and my interests are so niche, I don’t know where I could possibly find someone my age who would find me attractive, physically or emotionally.

Despite my wonderful friends, I’ve just been feeling a little extra lonely the past few days for some reason. I needed somewhere to put some thoughts out.

I'm not really sure what to expect from posting here. I am lonely, but in the way that I have a lot of people around me that I do love and I do care about, however I feel so lonely in that I definitely push them away so much. I also just feel like I am in a completely different realm to them, they're all married or in serious relationships...good jobs etc...and I am 25 going back to uni to do another undergrad. Every time I talk about life stuff with them, I get very disconnected replies. Either that or I get overly positive (to the point it sounds like they're trying to get me to stop haha), or overly blunt (again to the point it sounds like they really want me to stop).  
Does anyone else suffer with this? I have been perpetually single and just awful at finding partners etc etc, and I am seriously apathetic at the moment. A lot of the time if I tell my friends about my ""single life"" escapades they just sort of look at me like ""for fuck sake just settle down"", as if that's not what I've been trying to do :p.   
A lot of family stuff is happening right now and I just can't get out of this stink of feeling like I am alone. I don't know if it sounds like I am not recognising my friends, it's not like that. It's more I am convinced they wouldn't understand, their lives are all so different to mine and so much more progressed. Another thing is they do ask how I am and I do tell them some of the truth but I just don't want to emotionally lean or dump on them, or to be seen that I am. In addition, so much of me just doesn't want to talk about it, mainly because I know their answer.

i've tried to meet people, i have. but, i dont think meeting people is even the problem. i've signed up for every platonic 'friend making' dating app there is, and i have ended up in conversations with people. i just... i feel like i cant connect with anyone. awkward conversations is all i can manage. i dont know how to turn that into a closer friendship kind of thing. i dont know how to become friends with someone. i just wish it could instantly be the kind of thing where we just say random stuff to eachother, randomly message dumb things we did, stuff like that. the steps between awkward strangers and close friends are not steps i know. 

the girl i used to be close friends with, she was also autistic, which might be why we clicked. but more than that, she wasnt like me. she was very good at speaking to people and making friends. she could make friends with strangers in maccies at 3am. she was so so open as a person, she'd just say whatever she thought, you know? some people thought she came off as a bit 'much', but it meant that if you wanted, it was quite easy to just befriend her. maybe that's why i was able to become close friends with her, because she had no barriers? if that makes sense. there was no complicated walls of closeness levels to navigate, it was simple. idk if that makes sense, i'm not great at putting these things into words. 

but yeah, i feel like i am just unable to become friends with people. it's just a part of who i am. so unless i meet someone else who is so open and easy to skip the awkward stuff with (which i think is unlikely) i'm just going to be... friendless...

2017,humorMeeee,1597162533,1,"Well it's my birthday tomorrow. I have only one real friend and she's been my friend since we were 5. Although I'm her bestfriend, I'm only like her third closest friend at best. She hasn't wished me at midnight for three years in a row (and it wasn't possible for her to do it before that, due to personal reasons). So I don't expect her to wish me tonight. So I know I'm going to be crying tonight at midnight. No one has ever wished me at midnight on my birthday and I don't want anyone to either. Tbh I don't care much about birthdays. But I do care about her. A lot. She's my only friend in this world. It hurts that I'm not as important to her as she's to me. 
To make matters worse i think I might be in love with her (idk if the loneliness or if I really have feelings for her). I told her about this and she doesn't like me back. There is no awkwardness or anything after that conversation and I'm very happy about that. It hurts a lot but I don't care about it as much as having her as my bestfriend. It hurts that she has more important friends that me. I've tried so much to be closer with her, like trying out the things she's interested in (because we don't have a lot in common), but she's just busy to do anything together.
I don't want anything or anyone for my birthday. I just want her to be there. I just want her to show me that I matter to her. I love her so much so it just hurts. Idk why but it feels like I'm only going to be disappointed once again tonight.

2019,punnaaa,1597162155,1,"I'm 17 ,and lonely for 3 years straight now. I had friends till grade 9 because I used to be the ""tag along"" of the popular kid in my school who thought I was nice, but once he moved out I had no one to call my best friend.

 Sure, we had a high school group of 7 friends who I happily imagined to be ""close"" with, but the truth is, I got excluded in whatever plans they ever made, and the only time they'd think of me was to make me wish someone else for their birthday. Not helpful because they were the only friends I ever had.

Then it hit me, I only had social interactions because I was the extra one in the group, sure no one minded having me around, but no one gave a fuck if I was there or not.

Fast forward to two years after high school, I have no friends, stay in ""touch"" with 2 out of the 7 people I had considered so special. Stay in ""touch"" refers to one message every alternate day because of the courtesy to reply, never actually having meaningful conversation or a conversation with more than one message a day.

About myself, and the reason why this is. I am a victim of indirect bullying since forever, having heard stuff about myself I didn't know from left right and center. I have SEVERE social anxiety issues, and probably have a self confidence level of the bottom of the Mariana Trench.

Literally every one I ever knew has called me nice, and I can confirm that myself with honesty. Morals are my A1 priority.I have always gone above and beyond in helping out people, reaching out, and doing more than what I have to for someone, sometimes at the cost of sleepless nights, expecting (but hoping for something?) nothing in return, which was PRECISELY what I got for my efforts. People say I ""care too much"", but I honestly don't understand why the standard benchmark of a human beings empathy should match a robot's. I just have trouble making contact with people, other than those I've known since childhood, probably because of my ginormous insecurities. Although on the few occasions I tried, everyone got instantly repelled :))
 
I can straight up see all of my friends online, but never get a reply to any of my texts. I tried reaching out, but once I hinted trouble, they would bluntly ignore me for months.

All of my other friends in the group are doing pretty well for themselves. They get away with womanizing as a joke, and have said stuff behind my back that hurts till date, and end up using people for themselves and being proud of it.

I feel like only my parents would notice if I died suddenly, and would have absolutely no impact on my ex-social group. I often feel like a ghost, but again, ghosts are at least thought of in dark places. 

I have tried the ""confident guy"" outfit in my new school, so far no friends and a few bullies made, so that's great progress, good to know anxiety didn't really matter.

Can someone explain why this is happening to me? What should I change about myself?If you wish to really point out and need more information about myself, I'd be happy to share  it.( I can't be a bitch, because that's one thing I'd never wanna be).

I have a great career and have been able to live a very successful life professionally and personally. All that being said, I've been lonely for almost my entire life. It all came to a head the over the past six months, though in retrospect it's been building for years. My ex left and took our children. She's been the center of my world and our relationship since the beginning. She insisted I get help for past childhood traumas as well as some more recent ones that occurred during my deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. As soon as I  started getting help she grew incredibly distant and cold. Then she left. Speaking to professionals I guess this isn't super uncommon as the core dynamic in our relationship changed, but it still hurts so much. She needed to be the one being taken care of and either didn't want or couldn't handle the responsibility of being the ""care taker"". The only shinning light in this shit storm is that I realized we were never really ""together"". We were just being lonely with someone else in proximity. I've tried filling the void with work, friends and even substances over the years and nothing works. So here I am, trying something new. A public decree as it were. I am tired of being alone and lonely. I am working to be more ok with who I am, and everything that entails.

2062,_malachitegiraffe_,1597117018,1,"hi, this is my first time ever posting so please excuse any mistakes. Also english isn’t my first language sorry.

i’m that person who knows a lot of people and they know me, everyone’s friendly with me but no one’s ever a friend. I do have a group of 5 people that i hang out with, but I’m always the second/third option. Every time we go out to eat i’m left trailing behind everyone else, they ignore me when I try to speak, and in projects I’m the one who does all the dirty work. we have an IG gc and almost every morning i wake up to 200+ messages between the same two people texting till 4am, and they both click super well and they know all the trendy stuff. I guess it just hurts sometimes when the gc is filled with ‘lysmmmm’ and all that, and when i text them i get three word replies like i’m not worth their time. I have pretty bad anxiety and depressive episodes and have confided in some of my friends about thoughts of self-harm/suicide (don’t worry i probably won’t do those things now) and they sent a meme that joked about suicide as a ‘wow I’m so relatable‘ thing. I can’t really blame them either cause I’m not the best person to be friends with. I’m painfully shy and awkward and anxious, I’m horrible at making jokes and I’m clueless on all the social media drama/trends because it’s simply way too stressful. But it would still be nice to be a priority and not an option. 

I’m also really nervous about immigrating with my family in a year or so. I’m Chinese and live in an Asian city rn so racism isn’t a problem, but in the new country I’ll be the minority and probably will get targeted, especially with the coronavirus thing. I guess I’m just scared that it’ll affect me too much.

So long story short, we were friends but she rejected me in April, but we did agreed to stay friends. Since then we haven’t talked, we only like each other’s pictures sometimes.  We never really texted before the rejection, only occasionally replying to each other’s IG stories. I was gonna start going to her church, and I went twice (before the rejection), but then Covid happened. Her church opened back up in June, but I haven’t gone yet. I think that I’ll start going in a few weeks.

So here’s my problem. I’d like to start talking to her again and become friends again but I don’t know how to start the conversation. I was gonna just reply to one of her stories and go from there, but she hasn’t posted in a while. So I’ll probably just text her. How’s this...

**“Hey (name)! I feel like we haven’t talked in forever, how have you been?”**

Is that fine? Not gonna lie I’m nervous that she won’t respond :(  But I guess that’ll just mean our friendship is over and I can move on.

I am unnoticed by most women, or friend zoned.  I have no close friends, but my dog loves me.  My daughter doesn’t speak to me. 

I guess this is my life now. And the world is a shithole. I don’t see things going back to the way they were, and life is getting more and more difficult. 

Tried dating sites; mostly scammers and fakes.  Legit women don’t talk to me. 

My ex got the house and all the equity, and half my 401k and company stock.  So much for retirement. 

I used to be a musician, but now there’s no live music. To be honest, I wasn’t that good anyway.  Got pretty out of shape during the lockdown, and have been severely depressed since, so I’m in poor physical and mental shape, with no motivation to improve or change. 

I still feel young, but I know I’m old, unattractive, and generally a failure at most things.  My mind keeps tricking me into thinking I can turn this around, but reality keeps slapping me in the face with a cold fish. 

I don’t belong here, with successful people half my age who have their shit together.

2110,JuneLK,1597084382,1," 

I lost my little drive, that thing that helped me to just continue to live. Every single aspects of my life is bad, really bad. There are no positive aspects to cling on or a chance in the future to be something different or improve or just change.

I tried. I really did. However didn't work for long. And there is only me to blame for. Only me.

And not, I am not a young kid in the middle of a tough period, I am an adult, a woman of 37, ugly and fat, boring as hell, not collage educated, who spent her 20s being a caregiver to a grandma with dementia and an uncle with schizophrenia, who had a serious of partner who were ready to dumb me as soon someone better was there (Yes, one had the courage to tell me so, I am not dramatic, those were his exact words), now my stupid job is at stake, my second job is fucking tiring but I guess I need to get used to that now.

I lost the drive. If I had it, I would probably work towards something better, instead I eat entire cakes, watch Netflix, drag my feet to work, try to avoid my parents when coming back from work, hid in the small room where I live and only getting out to clean the house or fix the garden.

I recently got the confirmation that I am sterile now, there is much that science can do for me and the best course is to cut the looses now. I don't know what I was expecting, since I can't afford to be a mother, but since it was my only ""dream"", well, it's over. Like pouf, gone, goodbye June! You are not worthy of that either.

The irony is that I made a reddit account to reach for people in my area, maybe do something social because in the last 2 years I stopped talking with people. I lost the few friends I had, my boring but good job and my partner left in the same month. I had a bit of drive and intention to at least try to be more social, share a laugh with someone, still, I never did that. I am just browsing over sad subs and complain about me.

So, guys, do not be like me and be smart. Opportunities have a small windows. Take them, do not look back or dwell or just think that it's impossible, you can do it but there is not enough time and if you wait too much, you will be stuck.

I had come home from work,  did my usual ritual of opening the door after a long day and exclaiming “wheres my girl?!”.  The house was quiet.  I check back in our yard and realize she was laying down underneath the stairs panting.  It was a hundred degree day and my roommate forgot her outside with no water.  I was so furious.  I was shaking.  She was able to stand, I brought her into the house and she flopped next to her water bowl drinking it in.  I confronted him about it, we worked things out.  But the more I think about it the more I realize that I’ve attached my own life to my dumb dog.  I’ve grown to rely on her so much.  Every morning like clockwork she wakes be before the alarm to go to work.  She chases me around the house and because of her activity level it keeps me always on the move.  Taking care of my dog.  All I’ve ever wanted was someone to appreciate me.  I’m super handy.  I can proudly state I can fix almost anything.  Delicate electronics, engine rebuilding, metal fabrication, carpentry, and even fabric and clothing.  I just can’t fix myself.  I just need something to need me.  Otherwise, I’m just holding everyone else back.    Before I got her things were the darkest they’ve ever been.  Struggling emotionally.  I was in college studying mechanical engineering full time and half while working a shitty job to keep my head above water.  My girlfriend of two years broke up with me during her foreign exchange program to date an Italian guy.  I had nothing,  no support system, no money, no help.  Just my motorcycle. I began playing this game with myself.  While crossing the biggest bridge in the city, I would hold my eyes closed while cranking the throttle wide open.  I would regularly break 120+ mph with my backpack full of books on.  I’m lucky I never crashed.  To stop my self from trying again, I fully deconstructed the motorcycle down to its smallest parts.  Promising to put it together after I put myself together. I got a different job that paid a little better and started skipping class.  Then I got robbed at gunpoint.  Was forced to lay face down in my own front yard with a gun pressed against the back of my head.  This moment was my catalyst for change.  Because the next day I got a dog.  A great dog.  A sense of purpose.  A little creature that would stare me in the eyes trying to understand me, while I did the same to him.  Fast forward, life feels ok. I make ok money.  I have friends.  But I realize how close I am to drawing the line.  Maybe I don’t need a watch but need to vent.  My dad had another heart attack today.  I live across the country now.  All I can do is wait.  He’s going to surgery and I’m afraid I’m going to lose him.  The thoughts are loud right now.  Everyone sees me as the most rock steady, level headed reliable guy they know.  I’m so afraid of opening up.  Right now I’m a grown ass man hugging his dog because it’s the only thing that cares about me as much as I care for it.",lonely,Sense of Purpose,2020-08-10 13:40:16

I figured I needed a way to make money so started a channel. Originally I was having a lot of fun making videos whilst my channel was small. Eventually though my channel blew up. Along with that success came a lot of terrible stuff. I started getting a lot of haters, trolls and stalkers. I also got people reuploading my content onto other websites and stealing my hard work. I had also multiple copycat channels popup and i relentlessly beat them down with an insane 2 vid a week upload schedule. It felt like after trying so hard multiple people saw me doing well and wanted to take what was mine through copying. Everyone wanted a piece of the pie. I didn't let them take my niche on the platform.

Despite the success, it was still isolating. The discord servers I used to talk in with my old friends all knew who I was so started treating me different. I felt as though I couldn't be my edgy and controversial self anymore because if I did i'd risk jeopardizing my image. I feel like I have to have this mask up that I'm a goody two shoes person, but I'm not in the slightest. I'm pretty misanthropic and hateful to be honest. I also have a lot of views and opinions that would rub most people the wrong way lol.

Despite my views on people being mostly bad I still get insanely lonely. I have this inner need to have friends and feel wanted. In my life i've always been persecuted by people for being different. It's funny because that difference is what caused me to blow up online in the first place.

So i find myself in a situation where my life is depressing af. I live for my career on youtube, but I hate it. I stress about my success a lot and worry that I'm never doing good enough even when I am. I want to make new friends and relax for a while, but I don't know if I even can anymore.

That being said, I don't think there is a single soul who truly understands me and my feelings. And maybe that's okay. I have come to the realization that it's possible that it's my own fault.

I have ignored most people. Except a select few who still get to talk to me. I don't really have friends, but I'm okay with that. People do show interest about spending time with me and being in my life, but I don't want to share my life with peole who are not worth my time. Every single person I connect ties with is a conscious choice. I honor their personality and connect my life with theirs willingly.

Being on my own. Alone... is how I'd rather be most of the time. I only ever feel lonely when I'm surrounded by people or when I feel vulnerable and hurt.

Loneliness has become my best friend. Being lonely doesn't mean that I'm sad. However, feeling lonely does.

I am fully aware that some people aren't going to like what I say. I'm just here to deliver the positive message and say that sometimes, being alone is a blessing rather than a curse.

I love myself, and spending time with me and doing things for me and only me is a joyful thing. Maybe isolating myself is a coping mechanism to protect my feelings, but honestly, it feels great most of the time.

I still experience those days when I feel lonely and without purpose. I'm still a human being and I'm actually very sensitive. And tonight happens to be one of those nights.

I hope it passes soon. Sending positivity your way and cleansing thoughts.

Thank you.",lonely,Alone by choice,2020-08-10 09:52:22

2200,nonstop2k,1597011205,1,"I'm about to turn 22. I'm autistic and suffer from Avoidant Personality Disorder, which resulted in me currently having only 1 friend to talk to. 

Which was fine enough for me, I talked to my parents at home, spent most of the time in my basement and met with him about once per week, while also texting multiple times each day.

At that time my desire for social contact didn't go much beyond that. And due to plenty of negative experiences in school and adolescence, I was pretty much done with people. I still hold a certain amount of resentment within me, although I no longer assume the worst about people.

However a couple things changed. About 6 months ago he got a girlfriend. They hang out a lot, which means that we have less contact due to constant sleepovers. Recently he started an apprenticeship, so we barely text anymore.

He will terminate it 3 weeks from now because he can't deal with the schedule, but still that's a long time for people like me of having no one to talk to.

However now my days are even lonelier and depressing than before. I can't handle this amount of isolation anymore. Now, I would think I should go to some autism support groups, and try to meet new people over the internet and so on. I never did that nor did I have to consider it up until recently.

But there was more behind it. Over the past few years, I have suffered from stuttering, along with moderate insomnia and digestive issues. I did my best to tackle those problems, and after much experimentation, I now have my sleep under control, and stutter less!

That's why I'm only now even in the position to make a decent impression on people. Being socially awkward is one thing, but stuttering on top of it and having no energy is too much, everyday life was already a challenge for me. I knew that I couldn't muster the energy to properly socialize.

But quite understandably, I'm now mildly depressed and lack the motivation for all the things that once interested me. Life sucks without a social circle. I feel bad most of the time, and can't focus on productivity no more.

In such a state, It's hard to make a good impression on people and learn to mask some of my autistic symptoms. Which I need to do. I don't want to be a burden on people and I know how I'm coming across! Years of social neglect leaves me with little of the few social skills I once had.

So I'm looking into talking to more people, be it in groups or one on one, online or offline.

Just someone that will put up with me long enough, someone that will turn me on that thinks I'm sexy and smart, and funny. I've never been with someone like that, I want it so bad it hurts. I'm not the woman that people think about, or cares to check on. 

I remember this weird story; once I was arguing with my best friend, and I made a point to lock myself and her into a room, I told her that we had been best friends since forever and that I wasn't going to let her give up on us. We are friends again now and we talk all the time, and I just remembered that my pride wasn't worth losing her. This isn't the first time things like this has happened to my best friend before, guys throw themselves at her, they do big sweeping gestures to show her they care, once I remember her leaving her bf in the street crying as we drove away. 

I know it doesn't help to compare ourselves to other people, but I was just thinking. That there is not one that has ever done something like that for me. I'm the girl that people let go, the girl that's not quite worth it, the girl that can be left alone in a room crying for hours, and no one would check on.

After a while, I just assumed I was annoying and not worthy of having friends. 

Years went by, and I didn't have a single friend. I would always sit alone at lunch and have no one to invite once my birthday rolled around. I was miserable and I began to hate myself. On the weekends, I would lie in bed all day, just feeling worthless. After a while, I realized that I was spending so much energy hating myself when I could have used that energy to make myself feel better instead.

2217,AltAccountAnyway,1596999015,1,"I am not sure why I am writing this to be honest. Maybe to ask if somebody feels the same way?

So my life friendship story isn't very deep. I am 22 now and has been feeling lonely for about past 7 years. I also never had a person I could talk about my problems too. Even if I had someone that would hang out with me (and we both enjoyed it) we would never talk anything serious. 

The most important thing however is that I would get to know someone in class, spend time with them, get to know them, play games sometimes daily, but as soon as we would go to different schools it immediately ended; once a relation isn't convenient it just stops being a thing.

I also have this thing, where I don't exactly care about other people. I want them to be happy, I am nice, I care about their feelings, but just not about the person. I've never had a bond with anyone, I don't feel abandoned when they are gone, since I leave them just as much as they leave me. What I miss is having someone around, not having that specific person around. I was reading about LGBT stuff lately and have seen aromantic label, for people who just don't experience romantic bonds the same way... and it got me thinking if I am like that, just for friendship.

It all leads to me feeling like I am just incapable of ever having a friend. Sure I can be in a group of people, hang out with them, chat, be closer to some than to others, but at the end of the day it's gonna be temporary. Eventually the group will break down and I will just not care. Good while it lasted, but I was never a friend of theirs, bye. 

When I see TV shows or people online talking about how they have friends that feels like a family to them... I just don't feel like it's something that would happen to me, no matter how much anyone would try. Not that I am unlikable or annoying, just that they won't be friends with me, because I will  never be friends with them.",lonely,I don't feel capable of being friends with somebody.,2020-08-10 04:50:15

I'm 13 and I've been through a lot of trauma and was raped twice as a kid, and because of that I have extreme trust issues and constantly think everybody either dislikes me or just puts up with me because they feel bad for what has happened, I'm very open about my trauma and being raped and joke about it all the time. These trust issues constantly make me feel alone, sad, distant and because of that I have very few friends, I befriend random people on the internet easily because I don't get close to them. I befriended this one girl on Instagram I really liked her artwork she said she's gay but I don't really care since I don't have intentions like that, I was somewhat close to her from my side but she just ups and ghosts me. This has left me feeling alone and worried that everyone else soon follows. She was someone I could talk to someone I cared about, and just vanishing without saying anything hurt me, at least tell me what I did wrong.  I have other friends but she was different I don't know how I have no intention of dating her since I can't and won't, @rambling_thumbtack if you see this I doubt you will, I hope you're doing well.

2234,Top-Year9687,1596986385,1,"As the title says, this post is all about mistakes. 

Some time ago I met this person. We both were lonely at the time (I still am tho) and so we bonded. It was amazing, cause it felt we have been knowing each other for years, even if we were just strangers. We started talking all day, every day, about everything. Like helping each other, laughing at stupid stuff and everything seemed to be perfect.

I got used to hearing stupid phrases like ""I missed you"" or ""You are everything to me. I am so grateful you are here"". The stuff that usually makes your heart melt, especially if you are alone af. There was some kind of balance at first, more or less. But then things started to change. I've been put away like a trash can and it hurt. A lot. I tried to do my best to rebuild our thing. I gave this person even more than I should have.  I gave everything, the best part of me. Like giving even more attention, always trying to help, sharing emotional stuff.  But it wasn't enough. This thing was slowly fading and, since I suffer from abandonment problems, we started living in a circle. Like I tried multiple times to get away to protect myself from suffering, but every single time we got close again and tried to rebuild. 

But it was useless. I was really unsure about the future of this thing and I started asking for confirmation. Maybe too much. We heavily argued but tried to rebuild one last time. But again, it was useless. Things weren't at all like they used to be. We were making empty conversations and, on top of that, I was no longer useful since this person has new people to count on. We were supposed to meet and do stuff, but this person has disappeared and is no longer responding. And honestly, this is not the way to show how much you care.

So what's the lesson here? Well, don't give too much too people. Don't make them your priority. Don't let them run your life.

Cause, when you meet someone, things might be amazing at first, especially if you are both lonely. But this happens cause we try to avoid showing our flaws. We try to be perfect. But this is not about being perfect. We are humans, and defects are part of our nature. 

So just go slowly. Don't grow too attached to new people. Make yourself your center of gravity. Cause if you give too much, people might take you for granted. They might feel you are not important cause you don't give value to yourself first. And this is not good. 

Give it time. Don't focus on what people do good, cause that it's just a phase. Wait for them to see your flaws, who you really are. Wait for them to react at your mistakes. And if they are still there even in your worst times, then it means you hit the jackpot.",lonely,Don't do the same mistakes I did,2020-08-10 01:19:45

There are people out there who care about you, even if you don’t think so. Cherish those people who are close to you and make you feel comfortable. And if you feel like you’re gonna be lonely the rest of your life, I promise that’s not the case. There’s a number of things that can help your situation, with your mental state being the priority. If you practice healthy habits, it can improve your mental state, eventually making you a happier person. You shouldn’t even have to worry about being lonely because there’s so many people in the world who would love to get to know you. Many people would be happy to talk to you if you’re genuinely happy and comfortable in your own skin.

I know it’s not easy to do things to “magically make you happy” but it’s a journey to improving yourself (remember to practice self-love) with a hard-earned reward to get even a few quality people in your life. Because it’s better to have people who are there for you instead of inflating your ego with many acquaintances (who tend to be shallow individuals).

I can't be the only one who hates summer really bad. 

It's not because of the hot days where can't do anything without dying. It's not because of the mosquitos. 

I hate summer because everyone is going out with their friends. Going to beaches hang out and drink together. Meanwhile I am sitting here and saying to myself that next I will have friends that want to do the same. Yet I haven't found them. 
It is a social thing to go out with friends and it is putting me under so much stress. 

I am currently 19 years old, and I do have ""friends"" but they aren't living in the same city as I do. 
And I am happy that I have some friends. About 2 People I can really go to... 
Well, one of my friends do have fun and go out with people I know, but I never come into their minds to maybe go with them... And I am not a person that wants to invite himself into some things. 

And then I do have another friend. The only one I am really connected to atm. We are playing a lot of League and just chilling online. And I love that. I would put everything in the back to spend some time playing league or other games, just to know that there are people I can go to if I feel lonely.

Recently I have also lost my best friend. She is not dead... It sure does sounds like that. 
But she stopped hanging out with me and found other people that are more interesting than me... Certainly its a common thing in my friendships that I am just thrown away because there are people more interesting...

2252,Ryanbrown223,1596969995,1,"I was servery bullied in school  (secondary)to the point where people I didn't know wouldnt want to even sit near me in class. It was a daily occurrence where even if I thought I was having a good day one person would say something to me and change my mood completely. Their would be days where people from other classes would tell me that people in that class would be laughing at me behind my back. It got to the point where I couldn't really do much to stop it because the main people who used to bully me spreaded rumours about me to the point it spread throughout the year and people who didn't even know me would instantly want nothing to do with me but the people who did speak to me they would all say that I was a nice guy and that they don't understand why people don't like me. 

I always had friends in school but not many. I would mainly hang out with two groups both typically had about 4 of including myself. It would be hard when my close friends would be treated soo good by the people that I knew talk shit behind my back. Their would be times when some of the popular kids will join the group and greet everyone apart from me that made me feel low. I've never been to any parties in school and their where lots simply because only the so called cool kids would go. 

Thinking back to me being bullied I think being mentally bullied is soo much worse than being physically bullied because the things peolle would say to me would dig deep and I know they would attack me if they thought they would win without getting hurt themselves.( I was one of the strongest in the year)

Now cutting to when I finished school, I knew I never wanted to see anyone from my school so I choose to go to college (if your not in the UK its not university but is where you can do courses higher than secondary school) where I knew it would b unlikely for me to see anyone from my past but doing so meant that the people I used to speak 2 was not their and although we would hang out occasionally it was not the same and the people in my class in college where cool and everything(I was one of 2 of the youngest) I didn't click with them eventhough we would typically get food together after class. The course was only 1y so after that they all left the college and I went on to doing another course.

My second course lasted for 2 years but the class was extremely small under 7students including myself in the first year and 4 in the second. I only keep in contact with one of them to this day. 

Now some years have past and I don't really speak to my old school friends (lucky if its 5 times for the whole year) they all made new friends since they went to sixth-form where all the students are of the same age and now I'm stuck. We used to hang out but when we did I would always go home remembering how much I was bullied just because they would talk about their  old times in school and I knew I didn't really have any good times so it got to the point where I decided to completely distance myself from them ( one out of the two who we would hang out started to try and arrange for us to go out but I would decline ) the other never even try to messeged me and it became clear that he wasn't really my friend because I used to always message him to see if he was alright but he would never do the same.

Now I'm in my early 20s with no social life, I work i go home and the only real social interaction i have is when I hang out with a good friend I made when I was studying. Its especially depressing when I hear people outside my house having fun while I'm indoors doing f**** all with my life I think to myself why am I even living because I dont really do anything apart from work and now with the weather being hot I am falling into a  deeper depression.

I know this is my life and its too late to make new friends. I don't end it I'll just grow up and die and not have may people at my funeral. I just want to pack my life and go live in isolation off grid until I wither away

I’m a lonely guy and have been for as long as I can remember, yeah I have friends but I struggle maintaining those friendships because I never really put the effort into hanging out and doing activities together, I would say we were mainly friends because we went to the same school and had classes together. At the beginning of lockdown it definitely was though I was isolated in my room all day long, my parents worked long shifts and I have no siblings so it was basically me myself and I. I tried to keep the friendships I had through video games but it was hard and I didn’t really enjoy doing it either. Another important thing to mention is that I’ve always disliked the person I was, not necessarily in the physical aspect but I always thought that my attitude was shit, I never was optimistic (I called myself a realist which wasn’t true at all) and I hated the way I interacted with people I always felt the need to make jokes to cover insecurities and make sure I had a reason to be in the group since I had nothing else that I felt was of any worth. Enough with that, fast forward a couple months at the beginning of July, after losing my job in March and feeling miserable since, I get a call from a place I used to work at basically offering me a job. Because of covid I had to think twice but I ended up accepting the offer. It has only been a month but this last month is honestly the happiest I’ve felt in forever. I don’t know why but I felt like a new job with new people was a great opportunity for me to try something new. I tried my best to give up on my old habits, I’m kind to everyone I interact with, I’m trying to be as helpful as possible and all around I’ve never felt this good mentally. I feel like I don’t have to play the character of the depressed guy who has to make jokes in order to feel accepted, I can just be myself and that’s the best thing that could ever happen to me. I think I was stuck in a character I never intended to create and felt forced to keep playing since I didn’t know if I would be accepted by everyone else if I was just myself.

I used to have someone who captured the best of both worlds. When we were together there was no need for small talk. No need for pointless conversation. We just enjoyed each others company. We held each other tight. We said we loved each other and we believed it. 

That was 3 years ago and not one reciprocated feeling with anybody ive tried to make a move with. Id say im fairly attractive (not to sound arrogant or anything) and i can hold a conversation im not super introverted (not that thats a bad thing) 

Lately the only sense of warmth that i gain is from long hot showers and i read somewhere that depressed people do that to replace a lack of warmth from other people. I dont want to self diagnose though. anyway im getting off track. 

Point is that im confused. Im confused at how or if ill ever find someone like that again. Im confused because i like being alone but hate being lonely. I dont wanna just hook up. I want to find a connection.

I’m already in my final year in high school but I didn’t have that much fun. Sure I might have made some memories with a few friends but not very many, nor are they real friends to be quite honest. I just feel like I easily could’ve done more, I could’ve stopped being shy, I could have finally started talking to girls. But nope neither has happened. Don’t even have female friends which is concerning. But somehow that loneliness is becoming worse especially because I’m stuck at home now. Which is why I’m scared of my future cuz This is it.

This was on discord and I can't believe that something as stupid as discord drama affected me in this way. I thought this was the most sensible way to do this but im hurting more than i expected. I miss having a group of people that knows me and I can trust to say hi to me. Even if its something as stupid as a discord server where i will never meet these people in my life and i probably don't have as much in common with as i think. I would say I lost a friend, but I lost them as soon as started getting close to them over a lie. I hesitate to say i even lost a friend in the first place, since these are just internet randos. I suppose I was trusted too. And i broke that trust. Maybe the loss of peoples trust and the status that comes with it also affected me. Idk what lesson i want to take away from this is. I want to say don't get too close to other people. True it works, but that's not as much of a lesson to be learned more than a defense mechanism for the future. I need to be more *careful* with how i get close to people in the future? That shit is hard. Its gonna take me forever to get good at that. I hate this. I want to go back. I want to go back to the way things were. But i know i can never do that, since even if i were to literally go back, theres no undoing the harm that ive done and the changes I made to peoples opinions of me. 

Im alone again. Im back at square 1. I need to get used to this shitty feeling one more time. I can think about going back, but doing so is going to just pull me back to a place of loneliness and regret i dont want to go to anytime soon. This pattern always comes back to me. Ill just end up alone again at some point. 

And its my fault and i feel so helpless, too. I dont know how to open to anyone, at least anyone thats important to me. I dont know how to be vulnerable about my insecurities, which just makes me more alone and insecure on the outside. I suck at talking to people, i suck at connecting with them. I suck at reconnecting with my old friends. Whenever i talk with someone on the phone i sound distant and i know it. Bleeeeeeeeeh",lonely,Venting,2020-08-09 16:14:46
2267,ideservealotbetter,1596952210,1,"I am noticing that even before the pandemic people had a mind of their own. It always seemed that I had to initiate and others didn't. From going to a grocery store to walking in the middle of time square. It seems like everyone is so busy in their lives that they don't seem to worry about others. In many ways it is a good thing in the sense that people mind their own business. But at the same time I wished people could also care. That sense of humanity when others are down or going through something let me at least ask them how they are doing. In our modern society we are so controlled by our social norms, like don't talk to strangers, or he is wearing sunglasses so he must be suspicious  etc. Whenever I stand in a line, and I observe others they are so busy in themselves that it seems like they don't know that anyone exists but themselves. I try to initiate conversations here and there but people just don't seem to care or aren't interested in others. Which is the reason I have so many acquaintances but 0 real friends. It always seems like most people who I talk to has some ulterior motive like how can ""I"" get this guy to give me information so that ""I"" can be on my way. And I am guilty of this to. But I generally try my best to have a small chat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know that is it just me, or the west and modernization in general (other countries besides the west included) promote to much of ""Its all about me"". ""I want to stay safe"", ""I want to stay healthy"", ""How do I get rich?"", ""Whats in it for me?"". I am not here to say that everyone is like this, but the way society has become so individualistic makes me feel like somethings not right. It seems that we are so glued to our screens, or glued in our minds that it seems like we our being detached from ourselves. The world is getting vastly more and more competitive and it means that you have to prove yourselves to be more competent in order to survive. But at what cost? Not being able to feel others when they feel down or struggling? Seeing a homeless man outside of 711 and saying to yourself, ""Hey at least that's not my problem!"", or ""Clearly avoiding a man asking for directions because your ""instincts"" tell you that he seems dangerous or potentially a threat so you'd better run. 

&amp;#x200B;

The whole point of this message is to let other people know why as a society we are so lonely. Why we don't seem to see the obvious signs of struggle. Why we are so closed-minded to get out of comfort zones and how that in turn affects us as a person and others around us. I truly believe that no matter how fast technologies progress or how modern our society becomes, if we all want or have a desire to get rid of loneliness we absolutely can! The question is do we truly want to?

I got a great life , great career, wonderful family etc. Unfortunately, I have social anxiety and depression that’s controlled with medication. I started treatment when I was 23 so I missed out on my young carefree years. I am ok with that. I am not a big partier so I didn’t miss much. However, I have noticed that with age, making friends get extremely difficult. 

I am not married and have only been in one horrible relationship. Again, that doesn’t bother me much. I have never been big on having kids. 

Here is my problem. I come from a very big family. Thanksgiving dinner involves 125+ people. We are all close but I always feel like I don’t fit in. I usually leave these gatherings feeling lonely. Now that my grandmothers are getting very old, every other conversation has turned into why I am still single. 

Lately, I have been noticing that I am feeling extra lonely. I work two jobs so I don’t sit at home and be depressed. I keep myself busy. The loneliness feeling comes right as I am getting ready to sleep. I get really overwhelmed and cry. I just feel like I am missing something , i just don’t know what. I also feel guilty since I have so many people I can talk to

A few years back, I made the decision to move in with my parents. They are getting old and I don’t know how many years we have left together. I love our arrangements. It gives me a peace of mind to know that they are well taken care off. They are very open minded and I can talk to them about anything. However, I have been hiding the fact that I am extremely lonely.

It’s that’s feeling of just not caring about anything anymore, you want to die but you can’t or won’t do anything about it because your hopeful something will change in your life tomorrow but damn, it’s the same garbage as the day before, and the day before that and day before that…

It’s a cycle of bullshit and depression, self-pity and loathing and I can’t break through it. I’m trapped a quicksand of my own making and I can’t escape. It’s too strong to pull myself out alone.

I’m 33, single and lonely. I had one good romantic relationship years ago, one real shot at starting a normal life and have a normal relationship with another human on this planet but like most things in my life I fucked it up, and now she’s gone for good now and it’s 100% my fault. 

I had my eyes on someone who I thought could be my next shot at love, but that like most things I touch didn’t work out like I planned in my head, she told me she’s not into me. You’ve think getting rejected as many times as I have in my life, the pain of it wouldn’t sting as much but yeah, it still hurts every time.

You know, I see everyone in my public and private life enjoying these awesome romantic relationships with females and starting families and getting married and like everyone seems to have like 20 best friends to hang out and share life’s moments with and what do I get to enjoy instead of that shit? A table for one, a movie ticket for one, …it’s just me, myself and I, and honestly I really hate myself and my life so really it’s just toxic bedfellows I keep.

When does this cycle end? When is it my turn to be happy? What is happy even?

I don’t know. I don’t think I’ve ever really been truly happy, like really fucking content with my life as a whole.

2291,kwontheworld,1596943183,1,"I've recently discovered the term ""pathological loneliness"": ""Chronic **loneliness** occurs when feelings of **loneliness** and uncomfortable social isolation go on for a long period of time. It's characterized by constant and unrelenting feelings of being alone, separated or divided from others.""

I'd never realized that this constant pain and ache of desiring company is something that is a ""thing,"" something to be examined, questioned and ""fixed,"" potentially. 

Before learning about this chronic aching condition, I thought my problem was that I hadn't found the right person, and now I'm realizing that my problem was I hadn't been working on myself to become the right person FOR ME. I've been pathologically lonely my entire life, not realizing that I need to tackle the loneliness by building better habits of mind within myself. I need to be my own best friend.

Discovering this term, ""pathological loneliness,"" has impacted in part because now I see how my difficult childhood and early adult years (didn't have stable adults in my life until I was in my mid-twenties...and I married the first person who loved me in a stable way) impacted my feelings of not belonging. 

I don't believe that I'm meant to suffer this ache of being alone, and I no longer believe that finding another person is the answer to healing that ache. I am starting to learn that there are factors that can contribute to a sense of unrelenting feelings of being divided from others, and I see how my childhood set me up for that. 

Now, I'm tackling my loneliness not by seeking a companion, but by trying to become my own companion, trying to enjoy my time alone, developing skills, hobbies, etc. 

Is there anyone else who can relate to this awakening, mid-life? It's really difficult to face: that I haven't been focused on making myself someone I enjoy spending time with. And trying to make these changes is harder than breaking the most difficult of addictions for me. It hurts, literally, but I have great hope that if I keep going and keep being brave and spending time alone, that the pain will ease.

Can anyone relate?

I'm seeking advice, resources or information on books, authors, scientists, etc. explicating ""pathological loneliness."" Does anyone have information to share? Resources for me to check out?

Since August 2019 I used to wake up every morning and have a group chat filled with online that I could talk to, play with and just overall mess about. On console we used to sit all day just playing games until we couldn't. Those were the best days as we joked about, annoyed each other ( in a fun way ). There was one person in particular who I was lucky to meet in reql life. Currently 1 month ago there was 7 off us. In July most of the arguments started. One of them was talking about my family in a rude way and searching for phone numbers and other details which he shouldn't be interested in. I decided to say my opinion, but ended up being told that I have no right to intervene. I quickly managed to get that kid to stop as he went on holiday for 2 weeks.

Here comes the part why I came to this sub.

Just 2 days ago the one guy I met irl decided to annoy me a bit so I turned on a short video he sent me of him laughing. He immediately got so upset on the Xbox group chat, that he removed me. I don't get why people think it's okay to be rude to me but when I'm rude to them they tell me that I have no right. I understood that he would probably just block me a day or two ( which he usually did ). But no, an hour later I go to check what's happening on my messenger, I'm kicked out of every group chat. Everyone wrote to me either ' fuck off ' or ' don't ever write to us '. As I tried to write something back all of their accounts said ' this person is unavailable on messenger '. I tried to search up their main accounts and saw none came up.

Conclusion.

That one person ( met irl ) went all to tell everyone to never reply to me again and just block me. So basically 6 other people blocking for no reason. 

I'm devastated right now. How can one person do this all to me. I'm basically left with no one to either, game with or write with, call with. I tried making a second account but that instantly failed as they wouldn't even budge to read what I wrote.

It's hard for me to get someone new to play with. Before I met them it took me so much tries meeting new people that wouldn't leave me. So for me the good days are gone. 

So tomorrow the 3rd day without anyone. 

My daily routine is basically wake up, do some stuff on my phone, play alone for 8 hours and then an all nighter listening to music to release the stress. It's to not have anyone to talk to or even play with. I might update if anything happens.",lonely,I can't believe this happened,2020-08-09 07:47:21

2321,ConsciousLevel,1596921159,1,"I was in a toxic relationship. She cheated on me. It was my first love and I really believed she was the one despite everyone around me telling that it ain't reality. I was clinically depressed. There have been days I've hated myself so such. I lost my self in the process of forgetting her. I was so hurt, I would cry myself to sleep almost everyday. It was painful, to let go. It was all in my head.

After months I was getting better. I kept myself busy. It felt like I was escaping from facts and I'm not really dealing with it. Medications helped to some extent. After months I asked myself - do I need these to keep myself going? I felt pathetic.

It's been almost a year now. I feel lonely. I feel alone. I don't want to be in a relationship to feel okay. I feel empty. I am tired of dating, I only end up hurting myself. The moment I sense some level of toxicity in other person I leave, keeping the conversations thinnest way possible. I don't know if I'm good with sensing. Just this paranoia kicks in, I just can't trust anyone. I become very negative about trusting the other person.

I miss her, I feel like crying to think about it again. I was never perfect, I used to obsess about her. I was possessive and lived my life in a bubble. I only cared about her, I didn't care about anything else, is it ugly to say even myself. She was my world. Ironic to say that I cared, despite me being rude to her. I was toxic because of my temperamental issues. I swore a lot.

Feels like I can never find anyone like her. Thinking about her with someone else leaves me with panic attacks. I would really cry if I see her again. I feel worthless.

It haunts me to think of the times I was rude to her. Swearing at her. I was consumed by my ego. Often times I only end up thinking I was the biggest hypocrite for promising her things and showed to her what I wouldn't ever. Memories of her being hurt by me, crying in front of me, flashes randomly these days. I end up praying she's doing well and she's happy without me. I don't want her back in my life. There's this absence that can never be filled or I think. She didn't love me,  I was consumed by anger because I was in ego love. Can I love? What is love?

2343,cretinousgeorge,1596908413,1,"I'm not having the best time at the moment, a lot of long term things are piling up and I don't have anyone or anywhere to talk to about this. This is a lengthy post so if that isn't what you wanna see then I completely understand.
I would like to avoid overexplaining or rambling so I'll try to keep it more concise than I would usually. Although I am gonna say a lot so I apologize about that.

I have had an issue with a close friend who I had very strong feelings for. For more or less a year her attitude towards me started to change towards me a little as she had started to ignore me and would sometimes be a good friend and others not and that all came to a peak when she dropped out of the school we were in and then lockdown started. It's been truly, despairingly and utterly heartbreaking for me and it hurts just that much more knowing that all that time spent and conversations had meant seemingly nothing to her and that I was going to move away which would effectively end our friendship and even then I heard less and less (I have since changed my plans but she does not know as I have struggled to get ahold of her). There's a lot more to that but I don't want start rambling as I often do.

My other issue is that with my close friend group I have been left out of nearly every activity they do which was pretty hurtful as some of those included birthday celebrations. The feeling is at its worse when I'm at home again feeling low and I see everyone having fun without me again. This continues to happen although I have brought this up albeit in a more downplayed fashion. Someone might ask if I want to something on a rare occasion but I'm not usually told details when I ask. Another part of this is empty arrangements which is when someone says they wanna do this or that with me but completely forgets about it regardless of if I express interest or eagerness. I won't lie and say that I haven't turned down opportunities to go out but I usually turn those unusual opportunities because I feel too low to leave my room.
I would like to add that these people aren't bad people, they are kind people and I'm close to them for a reason and I don't think they are intending to hurt me at all.
I do however have one good friend who has actually been inviting me out to things and has been more attentive and whatnot in general and I greatly appreciate that.

I struggle greatly to make new friends as well. This isn't because I don't try (although I could do better) it's because I'm pretty sure I'm just not that likeable. Most attempts at friendship or maintaining one have been pretty unsuccessful. I have been called boring on more than one occasion and I can't really blame anyone, it hurts to hear but I'm pretty unremarkable. I usually notice that I often whatever the non marriage equivalent of a honeymoon phase is where I have a short period where things are looking good and whatever is going on is going well but then one day it just goes downhill in whatever way it does and it just brings me pretty down.

I have no love for myself and sometimes I have moments where I have a deep hatred towards myself and although that might be my brain working against itself I'm pretty content with it to an extent, I could easily tell that to someone and not start to tear up or anything to that effect (which is something I'd do if I was talking about something that makes me sad).

This all culminates into the fact that I have had only one consistency in my life and that is my suicidal tendencies. I have had these for 7 years and have never gotten better at any point. They're quite prominent in my day to day life as is my pressing long term issues.
I want to emphasize the fact I have no intention of committing suicide, as much as I would love to have never existed or to be killed by something or someone I am very certain that I cannot and will not do it myself.

I think that's more or less what I wanted to say. I am aware that this is a little cliche but if you have read this far then I am thankful, I'm grateful that you are willing to hear my plight (:",lonely,I wanna vent somewhere.,2020-08-09 03:40:13

How to live with decisions that transformed your life from a walk in the park to a struggle that continues for many years to come? 

Does mental illness has a hand in it, or was it all a result of my own poor judgement? 

Those lines seem so blurred out eventually.. what is a symptom of what?

And the biggest issue ; loneliness. 
I can’t even seem to enjoy anything anymore because of this. I’m blessed to have a huge television, gaming consoles, netflix ... , even a piano i bought a couple of months ago because i really want to learn the instrument. 

But i can’t enjoy anything because of this chronic feeling of loneliness. 

When i look in the mirror it feels like i’m looking at a ghost of my wasted potential. I hardly recognize the person i was. And when i look into my own eyes I nostalgically think about the happy and careless boy i was years ago. 

The only thing to do now is to keep hope for a better future by trying to do better everyday. And maybe eventually everything will turn out okay.

I’ve been making stuff and going outside and doing sports again, Today I was outside in my family’s garage making something I had been looking forward to for days. My sister decided to come in at 8am on a Saturday morning and start smoking weed (she is over 18 and my parents don’t really care).

I finished my project and was leaving it to dry, As I left I realised because I was in the same room it stunk my clothes and I started feeling light headed and almost had a panic attack thinking I was high. 
I took all my clothes off and put them in my room, It’s boiling as of summer so I turned my fan on and that just made my room stink up aswell. 

My dad came in 30 mins later and started shouting asking if I had been smoking weed, I tried explaining my sister did it and it’s all over my clothes and now all around the house.

Then my sister came home and started screaming saying I took her weed and smoked it, Then my Mum decides to start saying I shouldn’t lie? Goddamn that broke me dude, My own fucking Mother didn’t believe me. 

After several years of me trying to convince my sister not to do it I practically get called a hypocrite by my Mother.

This is why I try and seclude myself from my family cause dramatic shit like this happens. I’m now sitting in my room after a massive fucking argument contemplating what the fuck I possibly did to deserve that.

This was probably the best birthday I ever had.. So many people wishing me luck, health, love and so much more. I could not handle my emotions and the positivity I received. I have never experienced so much attention and love, I was overwhelmed by it, but it was still such a beautiful moment that will always have a big place in my heart. I also had a great time in a stream on twich which was also recommended to me in the comments and I spend my birthday there.

2379,watergreygum,1596875051,1,"I have some great online friends which I've had for about 10 years now but all of them have someone else they would rather be with, I'm nobody's first choice, nobody messages me to talk to me. Sure I have fun with them when we do hangout but I have to hide my personal life from them because some of them are fucked up and I can't trust them with information about me. There's times I've just said fuck it, and shared too much about myself  and I always regret it.  Don't get me wrong I love these people and I'll never find another group like them but I just need something more. Everyone I make friends with is connected to this group of people in some way, so I can never feel fully comfortable opening up to anybody, I always have my guard up because I'm worrying that so and so will somehow use something I said to somebody against me. Thing is I'm socially inept so i can't start conversations or make friends with people that I don't already know. Ive found some other groups of people but I wouldn't consider any of them my friends and I know they feel the same about me, i just don't fit in with other people.

I've had a best friend but he always chooses everything else over me, I'm always the very last choice.

Every friend has a better friend they'd rather spend time with or a significant other.

Sometimes there's a few days in a row where someone will want to do stuff with me and talk to me and it feels amazing but its very rare and they always end up going back to someone or something else.

There's nobody that I can message anytime of the day who looks forward to talking to me, there's nobody I can talk to about my day or who I can ask about theirs. 

My only solution is to find a girlfriend but I literally do not know how to have conversations with random people, people usually get bored and stop replying when i try. Part of it might be that I try not to share much about myself until I feel comfortable with someone. I really don't know anymore. I could say a lot more and be very specific but im paranoid that someone I know will realize its me. And that's another one of my problems. I just need someone to talk to that isn't in my group of friends. And im not just being some pathetic fuck whining for a girlfriend. I've been around enough people and observed them enough to know that as soon as they get a gf/bf or someone new then im not as important to them anymore, that's just how it is, i get it. Thats why its probably the only solution for me. 

Its the best feeling when I talk to somebody consistently for consecutive days and they actually respond and act like they care and we actually connect. And it feels even worse when they suddenly stop and forget about me for months just because they have something better to do with someone else.

Maybe my problem is that I'm limiting myself to online friends, of course people will choose real life people over online everytime. But even my online friends choose other online friends so idk, it can't be the whole problem.

Not sure why I'm posting this, its really frustrating not being able to talk to anybody about anything real. The point of this post isn't to find friends, I probably won't trust anyone and it would end up like all my other friendships anyway.

It just really hurts having nobody. I get so happy when I see a message from anyone but I can't help but feel that nobody feels the same when I send a message. I feel like i like all of my friends more than they like me, I'm pretty selective with the people I actually like, so when I do decide that I like someone they really mean a lot to me.(and I dont mean romantically, but same thing does apply in that situation)


I think I'm just repeating myself at this point.

Sometimes I can talk to someone daily for maybe a week and feel like we have a really good connection and then they just forget about me suddenly and I realize they cleary didn't think as highly of me as I do of them.

I cant tell any of my friends this stuff because some of them might start talking to me more out of pity and it wouldn't be real.

Same thing applies here, if anybody here tried to be my friend after reading this, it would just feel fake to me.

I love people and I wish i knew people who loved me as much as I do them.

2382,OGBrownMan512,1596870792,1,"My girlfriend of two years, my soulmate, left me 2 years ago in 2018.

That same year, I flunked out of college because of crippling amounts of anxiety and depression and having no one to turn to as I was going to school abroad. 

That same year my parents emotionally abused me constantly after coming home, despite wearing the guise of “we are here to help”.

That same year while struggling to find a reason to live I realized who my true friends are as most drifted from me when I told them how bad I was feeling.

I took a semester off to recover and work a job to save money to potentially go back as my Uni gave me a second chance. My boss was abusive, crass, rude, and racist. 

I went back to school in Jan of 2020. School went well, I got a job at a bar, made so many friends, and then COVID ripped it all away.

I moved back home, I failed school because being home crippled my mental state. I lost my friends, my dream job, the chance to make my hobby turn into a career in the span of 1 week.

During the spring/summer bc of COVID induced quarantine I was almost catatonic. Eat, sleep, game, repeat. I played lots of games because they reduced my anxiety, stress, and negative thoughts about myself, and it was my social time bc all I had was online friends.

My parents teased me, put me down, and wore down my mental state bc all I had was online friends.....

Until a month ago (July 1st) my soulmate, that same girl from above, made me spend the money to visit her under the guise that she still loved me..... She did, but she never put in the work to remain friends. It’s a long story, but although we had feelings for each other it wasn’t worth the effort for her I guess.

That day I put my foot down and sent her a long text telling her that I wouldn’t let myself be treated like this. She hasn’t responded, but I don’t mind. I finally started to be at peace.

Yesterday, I met a new girl. She is so into me. I feel joy for the first time. 

Today, my parents kick me out. I have no money. I have no friends to crash with. I have nothing.

My family sees time with/around me as an invonvienience, and I have never really had any meaningful friends I can be around. I have friends over the internet, and I do love them, but I get the same feeling too like even tho they do care,they're just too busy with real people who they can actually hang out with, and it's felt worse since this whole situation with the pandemic.

Everytime there is any sort of reminder of how person-less my life is, to be honest it just makes me extremely depressed. So depressed that to be honest I feel absolutely sick to my stomach. I hate holidays and certain other occasions because that depression is all I feel, and it's unbearable. Over the last year I basically just slept and cried away Christmans, Thanksgiving, my birthday, and new years because no matter how hard I'd tried to enjoy my own company and be happy, that pit in my stomach is all that I feel.

I absolutely detest this feeling. I wish I knew what it was like to have someone to ask out, or someone to just talk to, but I don't. If I wanted to even do anything at all with anyone, too bad; It's just not even a convievable option. I did have a small group I'd made very late in my life, but they were emotionally distant towards me, and eventually they just cut me out without a word.

I hear often ""well if you loved and worked on yourself, none of this would be a problem"", and I already do love myself. I am confident, I have hobbies, I have dreams, I treat myself all the time, I am independant, and in general I am fine being by myself. My problem is I've done every little thing alone, and I just don't know what that other end of the spectrum is like, even if it's something small like the fact I've never even played videogames with a friend. There's not a single sliver of balance between alone time and time with someone else. 

The only ""person"" I have in my real life who cares about me is my dog. We both are the entire world to eachother, and I'd never give him up for anything, but it's just not enough to make me fully happy. Again it's just so limiting.

I absolutely hate this. This is the only issue I have in life, and it's just making every day just more and more misserable.

2427,RogerWaters228,1596843257,1,"Well, I have never had any close friends in my whole life, and I kind of got used to always being alone, but now it started to feel especially bad for some reason. I would really like to make new friends and talk to other people, I think about it all the time nowadays... but I just can't.  
 The main reason for this, I think, is that I'm simply not capable of holding a proper conversation. Well, if you give me a couple of days, I can of course write something or prepare a speech. However, it's just impossible for me to casually talk to someone, in real time. I don't even know what to answer to 'How are you?'.  
 And for some people this is so easy... they can talk about anything for hours without pausing... How can I learn to do the same?  
 Another problem is that I have kind of become addicted to loneliness. I mean, it's extremely difficult to change the way you've been living for many years. So, when I actually get to spend some time with another person, it immediately feels very unnatural to me, even though I had been looking forward to it very much. Again, can I somehow change this or is it already too late and I'm doomed to be forever alone?  
 Any way, I feel very bad right now. I don't think I will be able to accomplish anything in my life. I think about suicide all the time.  
 Although these thoughts have always been disturbing me, I used to be much more productive. I excercised regularly (but stopped when quarantine started and haven't got back to it since then), learned languages, studied math (not for school, but for my own pleasure), played guitar, etc. Now all I do is sleep, eat, listen to sad music, watch dumb videos on youtube and play minecraft. very cool.",lonely,"Lonely because I can't speak, lol",2020-08-08 09:34:17

Im 16 and i'm feeling really lonely for the past few weeks. 

It all started on my first school for the first 8 years i had the same people in my class and there wasn't really any1 who had the same interests as me. I was the kid who had fights every day and got bullied. I went to some therapy wich i can't really remember. My aggressiveness mostly stopped and started caring about people like waiting for the last guy whil ed the rest was gone etc. Still qas getting bullied but it was allright because i thought it was normal. Then i went to highschool. Got bullied again but worse. I tried to be nice to everyone but they just didn't give a f. Went on gor another 2 years and then i got into a whole new class with new people (still didn't really knew what having friends was like). I actually didn't want to go to that class because 1 of the bullies before was in it and alot of the 'populair' kids. I was scared at first but it went great! Getting good grades and having fun. I started making friends and i wanted to hang out with them wich was a big step for me to ask. And we hang out with a group of 5 guys i had never felt so happy ever before it felt i finally had people who i could say anything to. Then it went downhill. I started feeling sad and didn't really knew why it got worse and worse 1 of the group knew because he felt the same. I was done hiding how i gelt for everyone and posted a quote about depression on my instagram profile (big mistake). I don't really know how people thought about me after that but not what i wanted. I just wanted everyone i knew how i felt and that i could be more sad then happy some days. My friends where like wtf. But i t was allright. The day after i posted it i actually felt shit like worse then normally and i didn't tried to hide it. My friends looked up weird and said that i never was that and nobody reallybelieved how i actually felt. After that i was annoyed and said some things i still regret to this day. The worst part was that i didn't cry that i lost them because i never had something like that and it was for a short time. It hurts that i seemy2 sisters hang out with their friends while im alone on my room playing video games all day. Im going to a new school at the end o fc this month wich means i probably won't see my friends e er again.Im lost at this point and ask for your help.( btw i did get help with the depression never told the girl who helped me about my friends because i felt to embarassed) srry for bad english :))

Just posting here as I'm struggling slightly at the moment.

I don't have many friends and have no romantic experience (never experienced relationships, etc).

I'm struggling with the feeling of loneliness and isolation as well as feeling behind compared to others. I would like to move on from this and get on with my life, but these feelings are stopping me and, with days like today, they hit hard more.

I have a bit of social anxiety and rarely connect with people. When it comes to dating, it brings me down as no one seems interested and I don't stick with it long enough as I find apps soul crushing (this is not just me, right? I can barely stay on there as I compare myself to people so much) I just wish someone could like me and maybe I could feel loved/cared for.

I know what I need to do to move on but I'm afraid if I don't sort out my situation and feelings then I'll never experience love or make new friends. And I'm worried people might not accept me if I'm inexperienced.",lonely,Wanting to let go of Loneliness 22M,2020-08-08 00:04:56

I know that nobody cares about my problems, but I need to share it somewhere. It's gonna be a long story so I doubt anyone will read it..
 Also, I'm sorry for my grammar in advance..
---------------------
So.. When I was around 5 years old, I used to play a game in the kindergarten.. I was saving a princess from like dragons and magicians, you know...
Turns out, 13 years later, I found this girl (let's call her DD). I found my imaginary princess and I fell in love with her.
We really understood each other and had a great time together.. Once, I opened my heart to her and told her how much I love her..
She said she was happy alone didn't wanna get into a relationship.. I respected that and tried to keep my distance (which failed a couple of times, resulting into some kind of flirtationship..)
7 months pass, and we're still friends.. Seeing each other every now and then, chatting for HOURS, which I really loved. Her birthdays were coming, so I started making a gift - I made her a jar with 365 little papers. Every one of them had a message, saying :""I love you, because...."" I was really proud of this.
Summer holidays begin, and guess what! We're going on a trip together! It was awesome 😇❤️..
After that, I wanted to invite her over, to spend more time together, but she said that she's got another trip soon and she's really tired and has a lot of things to do..
4 days forward, a text message arrives... 
""I got together with a guy I'm here with""
I'm that moment, my life shattered. I gave her my heart, I gave her everything. I have experienced break ups before, but this is Entirely different. Something broke inside of me. I'm not capable of letting her go. Someone stole my princess.. We would have been happy together.. All I needed was a chance to prove it..
But she didn't give me one.. All she did was saying ""bye.""
We really had a thing for each other, I didn't make it up.. But she gave up on it and gave the chance to someone else.
I tried talking to to other girls, but.. I can't..
Once my female friend called me with a nickmame DD used to call me and I just.. Ran away.. I ran home and cried. It hurt her, so I'm not talking to girls anymore. 
Weeks later, I still don't see a way out. I thought of killing myself several times. I'm alone. I'm scared. I'm broken.",lonely,"Today, I died inside",2020-08-07 20:29:38

my most recent traumatic incident, an abusive relationship about 5 months ago, really put me on the fuckign curb yknow? i was left so fucked up by it that i managed to pull myself out of a lot of my unhealthy habits, develop my hobbies and interests, meet a few great friends and people, really got the chance to better myself. it felt like i was birthed anew, and i feel like only now, at age 18, i'm developing as a human, learning to do shit i should have learned a while ago, picking up hobbies and interests i could have had the opportunity to be developing years ago, but i never thought to because i was stuck in a sort of never-ending cycle of shooting myself in the foot and not taking responsibility for myself because i had a strong victim complex. i could have ended up really fucked up.

now that i'm almost happy in life, i feel so fucked up, weird, and different that i just can't really relate to anybody, and those that i do, i feel afraid of scaring off due to my stupid mental bullshit, so many undiagnosed illnesses that i can't get any help with at all, no therapy, an unsupportive father, and i live under the fucked up capitalist regime of the united states, no free healthcare for us! fucking ocd, probably bipolar too, and anxious as ever. i feel like i fuck up my friendships so much, and i love my friends dearly, but i just feel like such a burden. i'm just too much, and i feel like they never want to do anything, anyways. i feel like i'm a very ambitious person, i love to see the best in things, i have many passions, and i just feel like even with that i'm alone. i feel like i must be deluded and up my own ass.

i guess to talk about my interests, i feel like i'm into a lot of niche art shit, i really love experimental music, surreal art, idk weird shit in general. some of my biggest inspirations that have even helped me feel pretty happy through shit are artists like death grips, machine girl, bonnie baxter, etc... i feel so stupid and pretentious talking about this shit, idk. i feel like such an ass, but i just wish i knew people that were into the same things as me.

**I have a few questions that I would like to ask to all of you:**  
1 | Why are you lonely?  
2 | Do you believe you could improve yourself by following some professional psychology/communication courses?  
3 | What have you done to imporove yourself so far ( or do you lack the motivation/discpline? :( )  
4 | What keeps you on your feets/going in life?  
5 | What can people do to help you out ( for example, what could an entrepreneur do or perhaps a business to bring lonely people together? ) You also have those alcohol/drugs meetings, would these kinds of groups be effective in bringing together lonely people or does loneliness grow into a 'disease'/depression where as to the point that you can't even try out something new?

I have a strong feeling that this is due to my strained relationship with my parents and how furious/depressed I can get after even the shortest of conversations with them.

Now, I avoid talking to my friends and family. I've actually had some great times hanging out with myself (perks of introversion) but can only enjoy my own company for so long. In all, I know I have supportive friends and my brother (who's been in and out of the house), but I still don't want to talk to them or anyone else.

Any advice on how to fix this issue? I can't be repulsed by social interaction forever. This wasn't a problem before every social interaction with my parents became extremely emotionally taxing. What could I do to resolve this issue?

Thanks for the advice.

I think im just an annoyance to them, my personality sucks as is. I go from extremely excited and full of energy to extremely depressed almost hourly. So im sure theyre sick of me. 

I eventually realized the only reason i still sit with them, or anyone for that matter, is so im not sitting alone. I dont want anyone to look at me with pity, nor do i want to stand out in anyway. I guess i just wish i had a couple extremely close friends. But i have literally no one. I have one person who i still consider somewhat of a friend, but we rarely talk. I had one really close friend with Aspergers freshman year of highschool, but i slowly pushed him away eventually because of his occasional freak-outs and how they’d give me unwanted attention for always sitting next to him in class. I hate that i pushed him away because he was a genuinely good friend, im hoping i can become friends with him again as im going into junior year this year. 

Last school year, sophmore year, was terrible, I would have to change the lunch table i sat at every so often as my seat would eventually be filled by someone, id cycle between 4 different tables depending if they had room, i just hated how i had no real friend group that could save me a seat and be happy that i was there. 

Ive also never had a girlfriend, i had a crush for all 3 years of middle school, but she went to a different highschool and ive not had any sort of crush since. when i was in middle school i thought it would he freeing to not have any sort of crush but it just makes me feel like ill never love anyone and no one will ever love me. 

I think ive grown a bit content with being a loner for my last two years of HS, i think ill just be invisible and focus on improving my grades. But i still have these overwhelming depressive episodes and i dont want to go into too much detail, but ive started self harming. The only reasons i haven’t committed suicide yet is
A. Because i couldnt do that to my mom
and 
B. Because im absolutely terrified of the afterlife or lack there of.

i just dont know who i am anymore, i have nothing interesting about me, i have so many things i wanna do and get better at but most of the time i just want to do nothing. the only time i eat is when my mom makes or gets food. sometimes i barely even function. i just want to get done with highschool and then hopefully it might get better but idk. i need to learn how to drive, because you cant go anywhere without a car where i live, but this quarantine has made me wait and now im just not gonna get a job or anything like i need to do. i just hate being such a burden to my family and to any of the people i meet and try to he friends with.

so i think ive finished my rant, i just needed to unleash all my thoughts somewhere, sorry. 

TL,DR: I have no friends, i pushed the one close friend i had away, i am a burden, i dont know what im going to do with this life, nor how its ended up this way",lonely,idk anymore,2020-08-07 13:38:20
2502,DetroitMade94,1596770762,1,"I honestly have no idea if this is the right thread to be at...but it's worth a shot.

Quick backstory, I suffer from minor depression which mainly stems from not having many friends. It is nothing extremely serious, but admittedly, it's starting to take it's toll during this whole pandemic.

I am 25, I currently live with my sister, her boyfriend and my nephew, in which I have a good relationship with all of them. However, they can be difficult to live with. Not gonna go too much into it, but they are both recovering addicts and their overall attitudes are a lot to handle on a day to day basis.

I am also a personal trainer, which thankfully I have managed to maintain some work.. albeit 7-10 hours a week, it's something and it gets me out of the house. Other than that though, I don't do much. Not necessarily by choice, I just don't know what to do. I play a decent amount of video games to kill the boredom. I exercise occasionally throughout the week, everything is at home though since gyms are not open still. I attempted to take on a new skill in skateboarding, however I sweat extremely easily so 15-20 minutes of riding and jumping causes me to literally drip sweat and it's uncomfortable and annoying.

Basically I guess my question is do you guys have any tips on getting out and doing things? Finding people to hangout with?

With restaurants and bars and basically any social gathering being closed, I have no idea what to do. I hate being stuck in this house yet it's honestly so difficult for a guy my age to meet people, especially during all this. Life is starting to feel pretty dull and I'm low key kinda losing my mind lol

2509,throwaway665893,1596768824,1,"TLDR at the bottom because this is a really long post.

I met the most wonderful girl on this subreddit, and I've fallen madly in love with her. I never in a million years expected to fall for a girl this soon, especially one I've met on reddit. I've met so many girls on reddit who I thought were great and have become friends with but from the very first day talking to her I just knew she was different, special. I made a post on my main account to this sub explaining how alone I felt (been single a while after my last girlfriend cheated). She messaged me to attempt to cheer me up, and we talked for over seven hours that very same day. She cheered me up and made me laugh harder than I had in months, and I felt a connection to her and immediately knew I didn't want the conversations to end. After we said our goodbyes that night, I asked if we could talk again tomorrow, and asked if I could message her on another account other than reddit, she happily agreed to talking more and gave me her discord and snapchat account. 

The very next morning I snapped her a good morning message along with a selfie in hopes that she would do the same. Holy fucking smokes, she snapped me back with a selfie and a funny message back and my heart stopped.. was I really talking to this girl? She's so beautiful, way out of my league beautiful. Soon after, we exchanged phone numbers. She lives in New York, and I live in Jersey so were able to actually text, and once she got over her anxiety of video calls, we were face timing every day for hours. She's seriously so amazing, she listens to me talk about my problems without ever complaining, and even asks if there are other things id like to get off my chest all the time. She doesn't ever just tell me cliche words of advice, she actually sits there and tries to think of solutions and help me out, despite everything she's going through. 

I felt guilty constantly talking about my problems upon realizing she lives a pretty difficult life herself. She struggles with anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, and self harm and had never bothered to tell me, she was keeping it all to herself and just listening to me go on and on. Sometimes she would take hours to respond and then apologize, and I just accepted and never bothered to ask what was wrong until she facetious recently and I noticed her arm as she got closer to the screen. She had fresh cuts on her arm, and she quickly became upset and told me everything. For the first time, she was really vulnerable with me and told me every little detail there was to know about her, and I could think about was how much I wanted to protect her. It hurt me to think about how much more she goes through that she kept in because she was afraid I would be annoyed by what she had to say, all while listening to my problems daily without a single complaint. It broke my heart to see this precious girl crumble in front of me. She does everything for everyone around her with a smile on her face, from working hard to help out her mom and sisters,  sending money to her deported dad, donating money to charity and simply trying to put a smile on the face of anyone she comes across despite being broken herself. 

She confused to me recently that she's been very suicidal and both sat and the phone and just cried for a while, but it was nice. It wasn't nice to see her cry but being this vulnerable with her and having someone I care about this much who also cares about me felt nice. We've only been talking for a month and despite having romantic feelings for her, I never mentioned anything to her because she told me very early on she's absolutely done after things went bad with the last person she was interested in. I accepted this, and kept my feelings to myself BUT then I met her. Two weeks ago we decided to meet since we only live an hour away from each other, and it was so hard to hide my feelings. We both recently tested negative for covid and agreed on a picnic in Central Park. I was there before her to set up, and then I looked up and saw her and my heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. She looked like the most beautiful thing, and she was here with me. I had never seen what her body looked like before this, and seeing the body she hated so much for the first time made my heart flutter. I know this is a lot of admiration, but the girl is just wow. As I was saying, her body, its perfect especially in the silky blue dress she wore. 

I stumbled to find the right words when I saw her, but I settled on ""Hiyo"" as I was thinking of saying hello and hi at the same time. She chuckled and said "" well hiyo to you too"" and we both laughed for a minute. She could tell I was quite nervous and teased me for a bit but also managed to comfort me. One of the many things I love about her is how much of a hard time she gives me while never being mean, she teases me a lot and makes so many jokes but always makes sure she doesn't go overboard and makes sure I'm okay. As we were both lying there eating cheese and tomato sandwiches (she's vegetarian and I didn't know what to make) I looked at her, and it took everything in me not to kiss her. I couldn't tell her I liked her or even more, that I was in love with her yet. It was too soon as I was afraid id overwhelm her and lose her. After our picnic, an afternoon of adventuring and trying her favorite pizza spot and froyo (which she both paid for because she's annoyingly sweet) I walked her to the subway station, where she kissed me on the cheek and we both said goodbye. That kiss melted my heart and I still can't stop thinking about that and so much more.

She texted me as soon as she got home and told me about how much of a great time she had, and thanked me for everything. We've been talking everyday since, and with each day my love for her grows and its becoming increasingly difficult to keep my feelings in. Sometimes I get the feeling she might like me because of how sweet she is and how long we talk every single day, from the moment she wakes up to the moment she goes to bed but I don't want to jump to conclusions. She's sweet to everyone, and I still have a hard time believing a girl like her could ever be interested in a guy like me. She's mentioned she falls for anyone who's nice to her despite how they look like, which has given me hope but she also gets a lot of attention from guys who have so much more to offer than me. I'm afraid to tell her about my feelings and scare her way, and I'm afraid she doesn't feel the way I do. I don't know what to do, there are so many risks and I may ultimately lose her. Even if I can't have her, I still want her in my life and I'm so stuck on what to do. 

TLDR: I met a girl on reddit and fell head over heels in love with her. She doesn't know how I feel and I don't know whether to tell her about my feelings because I run the risk of losing her and our friendship.",lonely,I'm afraid to lose her,2020-08-07 12:53:44

2523,plantgirlinc,1596762863,1,"(21F) The first time I ever felt alone was when I was when I was 12. Then over the next few years I had more friends than anyone I knew. People would always ask me to hang out and I had to cancel or reject plans because I couldn’t be in 3 places at one time yet I still felt alone. Then when I was 15 I fell into depression, went to the hospital, and cut off contact with everyone I was close to because they started to exclude me and eventually I found out it was because they didn’t like me. In fact they would actually flaunt their past and previous plans that I was excluded from right in front of me, the only person present who wasn’t invited and this became a recurring instance (though to a lesser extent) with other friendships I’ve had and now I’ve become untrusting and paranoid. For the next couple years I’ve fallen in &amp; out of relationships and friendships over the course of just a few months that were pursued out of desperation &amp; the want/need to be loved and appreciated. The only things that have been consistent in my life since 2012 are my loneliness, depression, low self-esteem, doubt, and paranoia.

I should also mention that I feel completely incompetent at work and school. I’m the one person at my job that can never seem to figure out the most basic things even though everyone else is younger than me. They’re so nice and accommodating but I know that inside it causes them a lot of frustration (and some of them actually show it, understandably).

At this point I just can’t seem to grasp onto the concept that someone may like me let alone want to be my friend or spend time with me at all, whether it be at school, work, or anywhere else.

Another thing that shouldn’t go unmentioned is that after everything I said about my early teens, I sort of gave up and decided to become a loner. Usually I’m okay being by myself, in fact I often enjoy the peace that comes with being alone, but I’m human and do every now and then have the urge to socialize: To go out with friends, or even just one friend, and just not be by myself.

I think it’s possible that I could make peace with this lifestyle, but I’m only 21 and I hope to get married one day, to have bridesmaids and a maid of honor at my wedding.

This in return has made me isolate myself on top of the pandemic isolation that is going on right now. I have no friends and nobody to talk about my thoughts, this has made think i am a lost cause and that life is useless. I been having suicidal thoughts for years now. From being extremely depressed  and extreme isolation and extreme boredom, I started recently to cut myself, after doing it i fell to the floor crying and thinking to myself why i have done this. The problem is it wasn’t that bad and i’m scared to go back to it but at the same time i want to do it again. There is no one to stop me sadly.

I have also recently tried to call a suicide hotline and chat online but they didn’t even give a damn and that was useless. It’s very difficult to find any type of therapy in this country. I have tried to talk to my parents because of my thoughts and they dismissed it thinking i am faking it to get attention. They have told me there is nothing to be sad about and just read the Quran and pray to god to feel better. But it obviously isn’t working. And a can’t tell them the truth because of fear of getting kicked out or making myself a burden to my parents.

Some final things i want to say to get the thoughts out of my head, i have decided to eat less food and always sleep deprive myself. I am also wishing my death to be accidental because I don’t have the courage to do it myself.

In conclusion to all of this. I know all of you people are on the internet and there is no way to actually help me in real life. I just want to share my thoughts just to feel temporarily better.

I know there's going to be some TLDR but hear me out... This is not a cry for help... This is just a vent.

Yup... 

It's a natural, everyday thing for me... I wake up early, go to work, finish late around the same time in the evening, go home, shower up, eat.... Drink more, and more as the weeks/years pass. Then go to sleep to do it all over again. Than sometimes I sleep around with energies I find comfort in (I am into astrology), as being an empath I am introverted when I don't work... I'm only extroverted when it comes to being with people I can feed my energy off of. That's also hard because the people in my life come, and go. No one asks me to do anything, or go out. Which kind of hurts, but what am I to do? I don't force myself to be in their life. That's their journey, and it's their choice to have me be a part of it. 

Now I don't have a problem with alcohol, I don't go overboard with it either, I don't get mad, or violent, I just tend to open up to stranger on the net... But when I have nothing to drink, because on some days as I always love a big glass of milk.. I feel like I literally have no life, because I did not chase my dreams when I was younger. So to the younger people on here.... Follow your gut, chase those dreams, nothing is impossible if you put work, and intention into it.. I believe in you. I sure wish someone told me this when I was 17-25... 

Now I do have a good job that pays ""okayish"" to me. But the rest of you would think it's a gold mine.... Money is not the cause to happiness.... For some people (like me) it just makes them feel more lonely... Do I want to find my soul mate? Yup! Unfortunately for me it's hard to find a connection, Looks don't really matter to me as much. Sure there has to be an attraction, but not model status.. I go based on how they carry themselves, what their personalities are like.. If I see any red flags that I deem are too big... I'm out!

A rough guess would probably be about a year or year and a half ago being the last time.
Now, I've become so damn quiet and not initiating any conversations with people because what's the point? Not the healthiest perspective but the one I'm currently rolling with I guess.
I hate it, I hate not having friends or anyone I can just call up or text to do something. My phone is essentially just a pocket computer cuz only calls I get are either robo spam calls, work related, or parents.

All I have is my parents and my dog. For many years, all I desired was to love and be loved back (platonically and romantically) but that desire has mostly died out. I don't desire love and affection anymore.

I have no other desires anyway. I don't desire a big house or flashy cars or branded clothes. I don't desires dozens of social contacts or head turning handsome partner. I don't desire fame or popularity.

All I ever wanted was to peacefully live my life wity my loved ones. But it doesn't like that would come true either. But it doesn't matter anymore since most of desires have died out, rest others will follow the suit too.

I often think about ending my life, what prevents me is my parents. They love me a lot and have provided me all sorts of material comforts. My abrupt passing will leave traumatised for rest of their lives. So I hold it out so long as my parents are alive

2558,MikeC337,1596736526,1,"Here’s my story. I used to be a happy person. But now I don’t remember the last time I felt content with life.

Things haven’t worked out for me. In fact for years it seems I’ve just had a long streak of bad luck that has wore me down into a cynical person trying desperately to remain optimistic.

Most of my friends left me or I left them because of one reason or another. When I moved from my home-town I wanted to start fresh. Little did I know how hard it would be to do it. 

I’ve been living up north for a couple years now. Things haven’t really improved. In fact most of my hopes have become disappointments. This is something I’ve almost grown numb to. Maybe it’s my depression. Feeling empty to the point where nothing seems to matter. Because it all leads to the same outcome. So I buried my pain... for a long time. 


Then I met this girl who has suffered on the inside the way I have... 

We connected. We could talk endlessly about everything and nothing. Slowly getting to know each other...It was such a joy to be around her. But she had a wall up... for good reason. Each time I removed a brick she would simply add another. 
Sometimes I felt like it was impossible to truly be close to her.

Then I started to catch feelings for her. I tried to ignore them but I could not... 

We tried to make it work. 

We even briefly became FWB’s and that only made my feelings for her even more intense. 

Things slowly began to crumble after that. I could not let go of it. I wanted her. More than anything. But she just would not reciprocate and to her credit she tried as hard as she possibly could to keep our friendship together... and I tried to compromise by sticking around. 
This wouldn’t last long....

I asked her if she would change her mind one day ... and her answer is what lead to me making my decision to leave her.

 I realized that...  I would never stop wanting her. As something more than a friend. 

To tell you the truth... I was falling in love with her and I couldn’t let that happen. The longer I stayed. The worse it would get.

We had a long goodbye... and tears were shed. She means so much to me and I know she cares deeply about me as well. 

I promised her that if she ever needed me. I would always answer... I just don’t know if that will ever be enough just as I was never quite enough.

She told me that I was like a sunshine with clouds. She asked me to not let this be another “cloud” in my life.
I told her it already was... Leaving her is like cutting off a limb. 
....

I didn’t want this!! I didn’t ask for it! 
But what was I SUPPOSED TO DO? She said she doesn’t deserve me... but she does. She deserves the world. 


My heart aches... I want nothing more than to come back to her and beg for forgiveness. For hurting her... For making her cry.

I can’t do it though... I have to have respect for myself and move forward. If she’s not willing to take a chance and have a relationship with me then I can’t stay because I’ll  just be torturing myself.

It feels like... even though I’m the one waking away. She’s the one leaving.

So I’ll end my sad story by quoting lyrics from a song that reminds me of her

“When you said your last goodbye... I died a little bit inside...”

“If you loved me... Why’d you leave me?”

I'm lonely, yet surrounded by people. All people see is an external projection and not what's inside my head. Externally I'm just a positive, optimistic and fun guy.. Or well that's what I try to show to anyone ive ever met. Internally.. I'm depressed. All I have are negative thoughts. Somedays I wonder what's the point of living. Another day alone where the things I want I won't get, the girl I like won't notice me, and the family I want won't change.

It's a constant uphill climb for me and I wonder whats my breaking point. I hate myself more than anyone else could. If I take too long to hit my stride and love myself I'm pretty sure I won't want to hold onto anything.

I try, I get hurt, I try, I get hurt is my cycle of life. I'm at the point where not getting hurt is like a luxury.

I've come out to people trust me I have. Slowly I've unravelled what I am, what goes on in my head, yet until now... Its only resulted in harm to my mental state as I end up getting hurt.

2579,someb0i,1596706232,1,"in all honesty, this is more like a rant about my mental health fucking up for like three years straight. at the moment i’m halfway through my fourteen year of being alive, so i never really dared to open up because most people would just brush it off saying i’m overreacting because apparently young people don’t have feelings. by the way sorry in advance if my english is bad at certain times it isn’t my primary language 

two years and a half ago, i had to go through a huge heartbreak pretty much all by my own, because i didn’t have any friends i felt like i could trust. it didn’t help that at that time my leg was broken so i was most of the time home. even before then i lived some things but that one fucked me up hard. i hated myself, i didn’t even dare to go to school anymore so i basically skipped a whole ass semester because of it. luckily, i reached out to someone because i was such a broken mess i really needed help. i got over that person but it still left me a scar and kinda traumatized me to a certain level. since then, i just realized a lot and changed a lot, i matured mentally, but not necessarily for the best. i don’t trust everyone fully, death just haunts me daily to the point i can’t even fucking sleep at night (that’s why i’m writing this at 5 am) but the worst part is that i don’t feel true happiness anymore at all. there’s always like something inside that corrupts any good feeling i get. it’s really really hard to explain but i just can’t appreciate life much anymore because of it. i’m always thinking of shit to ruin my day. another thing that doesn’t help is that it’s pretty much impossible for me to reach out for help about this. communication between me and my mom (the only parent i live with, my dad living further north) is just bad. so not only is her help unreachable to me, therapy of any kind is as accessible as her help. i don’t trust much people to talk to them about this these days, only my girlfriend but we both have our troubles, but it’s hard for her to help me (like solving the issue kind of help). so for some reason i trust this place to like get any help i could get. i tried before elsewhere and it never really worked, i just kinda hope it will here. thanks for the read",lonely,don’t know what’s the most fitting title for me,2020-08-06 19:30:32

I've been an introvert and havent been out much to meet new people. I usually didnt have time because of work or busy with all of life's things thrown at me. I figured, why not online? I'm pretty open to about anything and a down to earth person really. I enjoy video games, movies, music and anime. I'm not sure if it matters or if curious but I'm a straight male.

It's not that I don't care about them. I feel rather disconnected? If that makes sense. Like I want to move on with my life. The prominent feeling I've had towards my dependency of friendships has changed. I've stepped back and reevaluated my friendships it helps now as I'm less needy.

I still don't feel like I'm moving forward. As for romance the past four dates I've immediately lost interest. I do feel a form of attraction but I can easily dismiss it. It saddens me a little. I feel like I don't care, but maybe I'm just tired.

2586,Luv2Rock,1596702702,1,"I've been posting on r/ForeverAloneDating for a while, but I only just stumbled across r/lonely. The interesting thing is, people seem WAY more alone here than there. A few people are lonely for other reasons of course, but the vast majority of people on here seem to be lonely primarily because they don't feel attractive/can't get a date. It's WAY WORSE here than on r/ForeverAloneDating...which is kind of shocking, right?

So my question is for both the frequent users of this subreddit and the Moderators. Why do people here not post \[M\] or \[F\] in the subject line of every post and also put a photo link in the body of every post? I know this is not a dating sub, but it seems to me to be common sense that if everyone here did these two things, at least a few of us lonely people might find a fellow lonely person that they are attracted to, romances could blossom, and then there would be less desperately lonely people crying out for help here.

Any thoughts?

The first one, two years ago, began with a foreign exchange student [23F] that I [22M] met at my local college. She came over to my house and watched me play video games and we watched a movie and we really hit it off I would say. I had a lot of anxiety and I couldn’t explain why but I really loved her even though she made me angry at times. We went to Jamba Juice and I would drive her to and pick her up from school at times since she did not have a car. 

We would go swimming in my pool and we both liked each other for the most part. We talked about taking a road trips up to my cabin in the north but since it’s my parents cabin I couldn’t just go whenever I wanted and she had school during the week so I went one week by myself and she got upset. She asked me to come home so I drove home the next day and we hooked up. We smoked a joint together and I went down on her and it was really sexy. Somewhere during the sex there was a really bad smell. She lay motionless with her face down and ass up as the scent of shit filled the room. I looked at her butthole and I couldn’t see any shit on the surface but she was holding in a big one and was waiting for me to leave. I didn’t mind but She was really embarrassed and her roommate came home at the same time so she kicked me out and honestly that was the falling out of our relationship.

This is the first year in three years that I'll be spending it alone because of my breakup, and I honestly I don't think anyone I know will want to be around me or show interest in being with me.

My friend from my previous town that I lived in recently invited me to come with him on my birthday to his other friends birthday party... guess he didn't know my birthday is on that exact day. Kind of stings because I feel like I just don't exist and no one cares. I just sat there awkwardly saying ""maybe"" because I didn't want to bring up the fact that my birthday is on that day.

I moved to a new town for college and I have one old friend from highschool here. My new friend group that my old friend brought me into has someone with birthday 3 days before mine, but I'm new to this group so I don't want to awkwardly force them to do anything on my day since it's so close to someone else's. I'm just so socially awkward that I don't know what to do. I'm thinking of just not telling anyone and letting the day go by, but at the same time I don't know how I'll react when they bring it up if they find out.

I asked my parents if they'll be coming to my town for my birthday (hour and a half away from them) and they just shook their head and said it was too far of a drive. My own parents don't even care enough to make the drive.

Honestly I'm just terrified of my birthday. It's my 21st and I'll be sitting alone in my apartment wondering where the hell I went wrong in my life.

I realize i have a ton of anxiety about men in general and I feel i cannot really find anyone that sees me for who I am and not another face or someone to amuse themselves with for now.

This is gonna be a long one so idk buckle up if you feel like reading it. 

When i was 15 i was a sophomore in high school and i had some friends. Not a lot but i mean.. some. Well i started dating this girl that i had been friends with since my 6th grade year. First relationship so not a lot to go off in terms of reference of what was a red flag. Well not to get too into it but she was extremely manipulative and abusive (in a lot of ways but especially in a social aspect) and before i knew it, it was 2 years later and i had no friends bc i wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone she wasn’t friends or didn’t approve of. (which was literally every damn one. Except her fucking brother who ALWAYS turned a blind eye to how she treated me. Anyways.) But she was allowed to do whatever she wanted and i was never allowed to get mad. So boom i had no friends, or anyone to go to. Well finally i broke up with her bc i got tired of being sad and feeling worthless bc of her. Well that didn’t work too well bc like i said i had no friends to go to. Her and her brother (and one of her friends who was in love with her brother 🙄) were all i had. And obviously if i didn’t speak to my ex they wouldn’t speak to me. Well most ppl would cut their losses and move along but i was 17 about to finish high school and i was severely depressed due to home life, that situation and some other things, so being lonely was literally awful and i couldn’t do it. So i decided to be her friend bc everything was okay when we were friends before. 

plot twist: everything was not okay. 
she continued to control all aspects of my social life. dating life, platonic relationships, family relationships while she got to still do whatever she wanted and at this point of the abuse cycle i honestly just believed her. So that’s really all i really have to say about why i didn’t just drop her 

Fast forward to the present. I no longer speak to her. Idk where tf she is thank god. I now have a gf who treats me well. and actually cares about me. We’ve been together for a little over a year now. She’s great. i only really went into details bc i don’t want someone to just be like “ah nah. no friends?? this dude must be weird as fuck.” 

Anyways I said all that to say this: i still don’t really have any friends. I would like some (specifically guy friends tbh bc a dude needs some damn guy friends 😂. but i’m not gonna ignore you solely if you’re a girl) I have a few friends but only bc they’re my girlfriend’s friends. and i mean they’re cool. But 1. they’re all girls and 2. i would like have some of my own friends to talk to and joke with and chill with if you live around me. Anyways yeah 
So if you wanna be friends hmu. I live in GA at the moment so if you’re close even better 
i’d prefer around my age so like 18-25
uhhh that’s about it.

2607,throwaway68529,1596686258,1,"This is a bit of a ramble session, and I'm sorry for that. I'm 38 this year. This year, I've given up. I knew it was going to happen, but now that it has, it's almost a relief. I don't have to struggle as much, trying to find meaning or wrench myself back onto the tracks. Now it's just a waiting game.  


Failed in life. Got a degree, way too late in life because my loneliness basically killed my first run at academics. Had a series of low-paying, meaningless jobs that were never going to go anywhere. Never seemed like much point to trying to do better. Who was I doing better for? No one to share successes with anyway. As much as people say ""it's what's on the inside that counts,"" if your outside is fat and bald, you'll find it counts for quite a goddamn lot, actually. Didn't date much because of it. Those women who were interested at all, were less interested in me than in my wallet, my friends they could cheat with/leave me for, or the man they thought they could build from my raw materials.   


Made friends. I am, notwithstanding this post, fairly pleasant to be around and personable. Those friends have grown up and on. The ones who didn't cheat with my girlfriends and thus are still around are married now. Children coming out, or here already. They are, rightly, more focused on those families than on their single, fat, ugly friend. I don't let them know the pain. So far as they're aware, I'm funny and kind and caring, if a bit lazy and maybe kinda down lately. It's better this way. If they really knew they'd try to help, in their fumbling, tone-deaf, never-really-understanding way, and only make it worse. I don't need or want their platitudes. They can't help me anyway.  


I don't think I was a bad boyfriend. Hard to tell, bad boyfriends rarely know they're bad. But I was supportive (emotionally and financially), and I was affectionate, and I was loyal, and I'd be willing to even say I was fun. I definitely didn't do any of the really shit things that auto-make you a bad boyfriend. Never cheated, was never abusive, physically or mentally. Tried to always have time for my partners, though I didn't do it perfectly. There are things I think I'd try to do better, if I had a real future.  


Haven't dated in better than a decade now. When I get the courage to try, I get rejected. Most times, I can't duct-tape my self-esteem up enough to even get that far. I'm unattractive, I'm poor, and my health is slowly failing. No woman born wants to hitch her horse to this wagon. If the prospects for me were bad at 30, they're going to be even worse at 40. I'm not so foolish as to think things will get better at this point. I'm going to die alone, untouched and unloved for decades. Remembered only by a handful of people who never remember me *now* unless I contact them first.  


It'll be a while before it happens. My parents are still alive, and it would destroy them. But that won't be forever. They're old, and not getting any younger. It will suck, burying my parents, but that's pretty par for the course in my life. I can at least spare them burying me. I'll leave a note for my friends. They'll hate that it happened, but they'll survive.   


And that will be it. No siblings, no wife or girlfriend, no children. A man reduced to a stone and a hole, and some stories about my younger years that get told less and less often, as those that knew me make new memories with the people they love. The only thing left for me is to mark time until oblivion. Thank you for reading this far. I'm sorry it didn't have much of a point, but I sort of needed to release it from my own mind.

I was talking to my ex for about a year now a couple years after we broke up.

I was lost when we got back in contact and was stuck in the past. I didnt know if I was still in love with her or with what we used to have.

She had completely changed her lifestyle going from a careful and nimble person to full blown party type, driving drunk, partying every weekend, doing things I'd rather not think about. 

I looked past that still thinking that I was still in love with her, but I realized it wasnt healthy. It's like I was addicted to talking to her, I just couldn't get her out of my mind and it drove me crazy, and hurt.

She would tell me these things it just hurt, she wasnt attacking me or anything it was just knowing the things she was doing, I wanted to go back to what we had, I dont why I let it get to me so much but it did.

I finally decided that I should stop, so I am. Or at least working my way to it.

Now shes no longer on my mind 24/7, i can focus on other things, my depression has gotten much better.

2650,cloudy-nightz,1596659168,1,"Hey. So as the title suggests, I kind of don't know where to start?  I've always been a lurker on these sorts of forums, never actually posted myself. But at this point - what else can I do? I'm scared...I'm alone, or at least I feel that way, and I'm falling behind. My dreams and aspirations are fading by the day, overshadowed by life's harsh reality yet here I am, wasting even more time at the expense of a little self assurance. Disclaimer: everything below is sort of me going on a tangent - an ongoing stream of thought. If you hate complaining, whining, excuses etc. feel free to skip this. 

I'm in a pretty predictable position. Just your average loser with my priorities mixed up. For some context, I'm a recent high school grad. 19(F). Still living with my parents and under a lot of recent stress because of it. My whole life I'd been this awkward, introverted, emotionally closed off mess. All of my friendships never last and have never felt truly genuine, but I guess I'm entirely to blame for this. I can smile, and laugh, and hold a decent conversation but I've never really felt heard or understood...in High School I wasted all four years chasing after a boy who wouldn't give me the time of day. All I cared about was how to get him to like me back, and now I'm presently living in the aftershock of that agenda. I applied for the same academic program, developed an eating disorder, knocked out everyday as soon as I got home from school to escape reality. It was horrible. Thinking back, I was pretty silly but I can't regret it forever. Sometimes I resign myself to the mentality that life is better alone - that no one can possibly hurt me and vice versa. Never had a best friend. Never had a boyfriend, lover, or fling. It's just been me this whole time, hoping for something more than what I have...it's funny that I normally want to be left alone, yet I'm the core of all of my problems lol. Don't take this the wrong way though! &gt;-&lt; I hold no resentment towards myself, I'm just disappointed in the person I've become. When I go out in public I feel this overbearing sense of unease. I'm not proud, and I'm not in the proper headspace to face others authentically because my current appearance and pov don't necessarily align with who I am - if that makes sense. There's a whole world out there that I have yet to experience, and there's even more people to meet, but living a sheltered life renders all of the above as a threat. I have a car, I can sort of drive, but I'm horrible and clumsy. My skills are an absolute bust in that department yet everyone seems to be doing it just fine. Whenever I'm trying to park or whatever I'm incredibly embarrassed because my ""practice"" sessions can end up getting in the way of others on the road, and there's a chance I might cause a real accident. Honestly, my anxiety has been through the roof lately because I'm this old already with no license - which is a must if you want to be independent. Anyway, I'm currently in college. Had to quit my fast food job (yeah, I know) due to the pandemic and am slaving away at home to make ends meet to save up and leave. One thing that got in the way of my ""exit plan"" here was my sudden online shopping addiction. Within the span of a few months I bought over 200 manga volumes, several funko pops etc. I mean, it does make me happy and I love collecting but I really need to slow my roll. I live in WA and rent is through the roof so I can't move out this instant - I wouldn't be able to afford it with the pay I got at my previous job so now I'm just trying to create various streams of income to keep my mind off of things...

After writing all of that and venting out my frustrations, I feel a tad better. :) Though I'm a loser, I am in fact trying my best to change. Just really wanted to say something...anything, to fill the void. Maybe I'll take this down haha - hopefully I won't be judged too harshly. \^\^; Thanks for making it this far, I know it's a lot.",lonely,Where to start?,2020-08-06 06:26:08

The girls I liked and got along with were usually taken, and the ones that liked me just didn't really pan out. Couple that with moving to a new city and not really having many IRL friends to begin with, and things were pretty lonely. Once the pandemic started things got very solitary and I could tell I was starting to slip back towards depression.

Then I met someone I'm going to call ""A"".

She was amazing, easy to talk to, interesting, smart, talented, an absolute catch. And she liked me!!! She quickly became the first friend I had made outside of work and after a month of texting, then a month of texting + skype calls, we finally met up. Spending time with her really picked me up and gave me a huge amount of renewed energy and confidence. 

Two months of park visits and walks and she came over to my place. I made her dinner, played some games, and we even cuddled on the couch watching a show, which ended in my first kiss in literally years. I was on cloud 9 and I absolutely couldn't believe my luck.

We hung out a few more times but then she started acting a bit odd. I asked her if she was okay and she explained that she thought she was ready for a relationship but shes not. So okay, I understand, and we put the romantic stuff on pause. I was thinking that give it a few months and maybe things will turn around. We even made plans for her to come over again tomorrow.

Today she texted me and said she wants to only be friends. That she wants to go back to social distancing and wearing masks because the virus case numbers are going up, and that she doesn't know when or if she's going to be ready for a relationship regardless of the pandemic.

I get her and I support her all the way. I'm haunted by my last relationship too so I am behind her decision 100%. But for my subjective position this sucks. I was so close to finding that partner I could call mine. So close to being back to cuddles on the couch and kisses to say hello and goodbye. I look foward to every time I see and talk to her, and for the time being I'm stuck as a friend, which was precisely what I was afraid of.

Now I'm just hoping I can keep the loneliness away without her being around to pull me through it all the time... 😥

2675,Fadedinthesky,1596634658,1,"Hi, here's something you should know about me.

1] I have been a victim of Bullying at School and College, Nepotistic and Corrupt school and college authorities and Assault. Girls never liked me because they would rather stay away from a guy who is a loser with all hatred around him from his parents, awful teachers and bullies as for them the heroes  were the bullies who looked nice, were wealthy, had a loving family and a huge friend circle along with thousands of followers on social media. 




2] I never had a good childhood and my parents never loved me, I have been Mentally and Physicaly assaulted by my Mom, Dad and my 18 year old Awful brother. I'm moving out soon once I get my degree from college because in the country I live in, it's hard to move out of parents house before 22 and nobody gives you a place to work or live when they find out you left your family because in this country, people value family bonding more but my family is so messed up that I wanna leave this house soon once I get my degree soon because this Hatred and Assault is something I have been bearing since the past 21 years I wanna get rid of soon. And I hope you understand after reading the above two points why I don't have friends as well. 



3] I have been through a severe state of dark depression wherein I have attempted suicide a lot of times and was bipolar too until the age of 18 but then I told myself ""Why should I hurt myself? Just because these people hate me and hurt me? Why does everything they say affect me? Because deep down i know what I'm capable of but I have been giving up on me just because of them but well now that has to change and I won't kill myself for them to win because it's my life, I'm living it and they don't get to decide how I should feel  or live as!"" And thus I have been through that phase and emerged stronger to hold onto myself even through all the problems I have been through. 



4] What do I seek in life? A happy life with no pain and no sorrows with the one I wanna spend my whole life with, whose smile would brighten up my my day and whose happibess becomes the warmth and the cool breeze to my heart that calms my soul. Someone with whom every single moment is amazing who understands me in a way nobody else ever did and loves me for who I am. Someone who would always ve by my side during my good and bad and not just be my life partner but also my best friend I could trust on. Someone with whom I could have a beautiful happy life and a future. To me, a peaceful happy and loving life is far more important and worthful than monetary values and wealth. I'm more of a grounded person on earth rather than wanting a life of greed and deprivation from true love.



5] What do I like doing? 



I love reading and writing Stories and Poetry, Writing and Singing my own songs, Laughing at my own jokes to motivate myself at times and pass my time, watching Movies and shows on Netflix etc



6) How do I look like?


I'm Athletic and gym goer, 170cms, 60kgs of weight and this is how I look like

We lost contact but he text me a sms, we talked friendly until I text him again and he did not answer me messages and we lost contact again.
Years later..
He saw me again in a birthday’s friend and when he saw me he looked away quickly, he was elusive and weird with me. He greeted everyone but he greeted me last and he was...uncomfortable? Idk he was just weird with me.

2681,lilbbycakey,1596626656,1,"Hi, I think I'm geniune and honest. I feel like I'm a really great purpose to know and have in life. But I don't know why I have this guard up that I have trouble expressing the ""real"" me so to speak.

I have a lot of fronts that I put on. With acquaintances, work, family etc. Tbh it's really tiring. I can't even post something on FB or Instagram without second thinking that I have some group that shouldn't see the content in that post. 

I do feel like I'm trapped in my own mind sometimes. I'm in a 8yr relationship whom I love and plan to marry soon. So don't get me twisted. I'm not looking for romantic but for those who really understand.....that one person sometimes unfortunately doesn't always make you complete so to speak. 

Before I get haters, (which i did in a previous meetpeople subreddit and had to delete a post because of it...) love comes in many different forms. So good for you that maybe that one person in your life is everything to you.  But for me, I feel that it's nothing wrong having someone intellectually that genuinely cares about you in a no romantic way. Wow yes i know. It does exist. So I really don't want to go there if this makes you upset. I just feel like that kind of mindset is for the young....

But I'm just here to vent I guess. I know I'm good and I care about people if they allow me to be me and give me a little more to go off of other than a basic answer. I don't do small talk very well. I like funny. I don't have any talents. I play league of legends. I like poetry. I'm your best friend ride or die kind of type. I always got along well with guys...idk. Theye funny.

But I'm just human. I wear my heart and feelings on my sleeve. For some quite of time, I stopped caring because it's not fair that people i meet and care about...i give a little piece of me to them. Then they leave me. Throughout all of that...i found myself in a place where I had no more pieces of me to give...i had nothing for myself. So I felt really shitty. Sometimes I can't shake that feeling. I'm just trying to hold on to whatever I can that I have...that is worth holding on to. So right now, it's my mind. I think the words and thoughts that I have are worth putting out there to anyone who would care to talk to me. 

So yeah, I'm blunt. Direct. Funny. People probably think I'm attractive and wouldn't second guess that I've always felt down. For someone who feels so so so lonely in a room full of people...at the end of the night, it just makes me feel like no one really sees me that I'm dying for someone to ask me if I'm really doing okay...and to have them say....you know what I get that....i feel that way too and this is why....",lonely,26F EST - Wholesome [chat] -,2020-08-05 21:24:16
2682,fkadvn,1596626450,1,"Sorry in advance for lengthy post.

I (21F) have a group of close friends, all around the same age and females, that I made during the last school year and I've only seen a whopping two times since the pandemic started in mid March. And we had made all this fuss about being apart before we were officially in pandemic mode.

A huge reason why I've held back on asking them to hang out, social distancing aside, is because I don't want to be a nuisance.  I try to be the one who wants to work around their schedule, because I have an extremely flexible one myself. After all, I'm the one who's free and has money to spend, since I have a part-time job and am not enrolled in any summer classes.

And so I stood back, waiting for them to initiate, well, something. A weekend road trip. A FaceTime call. Or a day even to grab a quick coffee. Whenever I'd throw an idea up in the air, it would all be hypothetical, there would be no date set, and the idea would disappear as quickly as it came. Like nobody actually wanted to make it happen. I didn't want to push it, so I didn't. 

At that point, I felt like (and I still do) if i were the one to ask to meet, they'd turn me down because they were occupied with their own personal priorities, like work or summer classes. Or, they'd say that they were broke. 

For some reason, I started to get the impression that they were busy all the time, 24/7. I'd think, "" i really want to text them right now or ask to hang out, but she's probably working/studying/gymming/applying for jobs/etc.."" You know, stuff for themselves that's more important/productive than socializing for fun. And I found those reasons to be fair, because I know maturing includes putting your own responsibilities first. 

But when i look on social media, I see the one friend who claims to be busy cramming for her classes, or tight on money, is out eating with what I presume are other friends. Another one who works a tiring full-time job still goes for dinner with her other friends. I get that everyone has their own social circles outside the group, and it's not realistic to expect my friends to stay inside all the time working on their own responsibilities, but it still kind of stung. I'm sure that they're aware I'm free, transportation is not an issue, and I have money to spend. 

I'm starting to feel like my attempt to be considerate is just making me feel worse as it goes unnoticed. I feel as if they don't value our time together and instead, want to put effort into everything else while i sit at home waiting for them.

I have another good friend outside of the circle who is extremely booked and busy, but will still make time to come out and spend time with me every other week. So why don't these girls? Is my company not worthwhile? Tbh, i don't even know when the next time i see them will be.

I don't know how to bring it up to them or if I should at all. I also don't know if this is just a huge me problem and I'm struggling with my own independence. 

**TL;DR I thought my really close friends were too occupied for me with their own priorities, so I backed off, hoping that they would come to me once they had the chance. Turns out, they weren't** ***that*** **occupied and have been choosing to spend time with other people instead.**",lonely,"Feeling like our friendship (21-23 F)isn't a priority during the pandemic, don't know if I should shrug it off or if I should try harder",2020-08-05 21:20:50

I don't know, I will try to make this short and simple as mostly, I'm just looking for comfort and certainly don't want to have my first post be an annoying dissertation.

I'm an idiot 30 year old guy. I'm married, but through a combination of a low libido, undiagnosed ADD, and lack of hobby due to the pandemic (I'm in a band. We're awful, it's great!), I feel like I'm letting my wife down due to a looming depression that I can't control.

I should say, that I am \*very\* terrible at expressing my emotions unless drunk or talking with a stranger. A fact that I'm certain is derived from a sense of toxic masculinity that I'm neither proud of nor able to shake, so... Random strangers, have at thee.

I'm posting on r/lonely, because I feel like it's the closest descriptor to how I feel. Granted, reading through the posts, there are plenty others much more deserving of advise/responses.

Essentially, I feel there's distance and maybe even growing resentment as my wife, who struggles with depression and anxiety herself seems to get very defensive each time I try to express that I feel depressed. Indeed, this is part of why I tend to avoid the topic, but with a lack of distractions, I'm stuck and it sucks.

I'm not sure what I'm hoping for, but at least to be able to sit down and concisely spell out my feelings, for now, seems helpful.

2706,Runaway_beauty,1596605752,1,"I lost my mother when I was 16.

My grandfather, who had took me in until I moved out at 18, committed suicide rather than letting cancer run its course. We had an unfinished arguments thorough. His last words to me before I moved across the country, face to face, was that I was ""fucking up my life"". Regardless, he was a good man.

My sisters were unable to keep in touch and I ran out of excuses for them. We all haven't been the same since the death of our mother but it just leads to this point now. One cut ties of all communication. They both have children and lives of their own. Growing up, we were siblings like all others. They were out of the house before middle school and for a long time I resented them for not being there when I needed them. Like this moment in particular.

I've not met my father until a week before my high school graduation. He brought me plane tickets to visit for a few days. Was a lovely visit. He told me that I was a ""victim of circumstances"" while explaining my parents divorce and relocation. It was more of acknowledging rather than what I thought in mind.

I lived in a lot of places. I've seen relationships ended. And all the mental abuse that I've endured on both my mother and my step dad is here to stay within me. Not pointing fingers or placing blames but the cracks could have been avoided in ways that I wished otherwise. It hurts me to say this.

I came out at 14. And I regretted so. My mother came out the same minute with her cancer diagnosis. Then later that night I was beaten by my stepfather. There were following days after until I and my mom moved out of his house for the last time, that he just couldn't accept it. Years after.

I'm not here for pity. Nor for reassurances to believe that things gets better because they do. It's the fact that I HAVE to believe that they do. 

I moved away after high school with a guy I was seeing. He was my first. We only lasted a few years. He fell in love with another after the move.

I've not dated anyone serious after him.

Fast forward to now. 

I was diagnosed with Major Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Panic Disorder the summer of 2019. This is probably what happens when I couldn't let go of the things of the past as I do now. Or get ""too in my head"". Was treated with Lexapro until I stopped after 9 months. 

I've been thinking about leaving for years now. Not a place in mind but rather the longing for that peace of fresh start. As myself and what I were to be. Many people left. Friends, family, coworkers etc. Yet I haven't left. 

I have my trailblazer. About 3K saved. And very few processions. Just not sure where to look.

I knew his past relationship was earlier last year and they hadn't talked since the breakup. He didn't want anything to do with her and I do believe that was true at the time. Suddenly he stopped acting into me. For months I was so hurt, trying to figure out what happened, what changed, what I did wrong, but his responses were always along the lines of ""What?? Nothing happened, I still feel the same way,"" and he basically made me feel crazy. But he really had stopped talking to me, stopped making me feel nice, stopped doing things for me, stopped being there for me, and I knew something happened. I found out around April that his ex reached out and they started talking again, and he slowly won her back. They got back together and she eventually broke up with him again and cut him off. He's single now but we don't talk anymore.

A few months ago I started seeing another guy. He literally hadn't talked to his ex in seven months. He told me a lot about how she treated him so terribly, constantly used him, took advantage of him, drained him of all his love, etc. He even said she was evil. And then he just messaged me tonight asking if we can still be friends if something happened. I immediately knew he did something. He then explained to me that his ex just reached out to him and he's so excited and going to meet up with her and that I can't see him anymore.

2724,MaterialOdd238,1596595480,1,"I turned 18 in June. There were only three people who told me happy birthday- my mom, my brother, and my brother's girlfriend (who i frankly dont like anyways). None of my friends from school. Not even my best friend (who is in college) told me a simple happy birthday, when, on her birthday, i gave her a whole essay on how important she is to me and how amazing she is and such. i didnt get anything like that, and she always acts like she cares about everybody. she knows shes my best friend, she knows that shes important to me. i dont know why this happened. 

and i just saw on snapchat that my group of friends were all hanging out together at one of their houses. that was the first time i heard of it- i wasnt invited (and i would have went if i was). it just... really hurt.

and this guy i liked all year dropped me not too long ago after he got what he wanted from me. im sure you can put the dots together on what i mean by that. i feel used and hurt and it left me feeling lonelier than i ever thought possible. 

my brother leaves to go to college in exactly two weeks from now, and its 3 hours away. hes going to be busy doing college stuff and hes going to find a job as soon as he gets there, so i wont be able to facetime him or anything. hes really been the only thing thats gotten me this far. and hes always gone hanging out with his girlfriend anyways, since he wont be able to see or talk to her a lot either- but i dont think he realizes that I want to spend time with him before he goes, too. i tried telling him but he always gives me the excuse ""ive been here with you all my life."" 

my dad's never mattered much to me because he doesnt treat my mom, my brother and i very well. the only time he ever comes home is to sleep, and during the day hes with his friends doing whatever they do. they never answer calls so i dont know what they get up to, but its been this way for almost 11 years now. but i cant help but to think that maybe things would be easier if i had my dad to comfort me. 

and my friend who i played xbox with all the time overdosed, and i was told the day after my birthday by his brother. if his brother didnt tell me, i would have never known and would have been wondering forever why my friend never got online anymore. he was gone for a week before his brother told me. that week was horrible because, during quarantine, he was the only person who really brightened up my days and stayed with me consistently. we had so much fun. things wouldnt hurt so much if he was still here. every time i told him my problems, he always had something really good and heartfelt to say. he dreamed of patenting some stupid and completely useless product and getting rich off it (and if that didnt work he'd just become a nurse or something, i think). every time he talked about it, i would laugh at how ridiculous it was. he probably never would have gone through with it, but it crushes me to think that he wont be around to make the choice. i totally took him for granted. i never treated him poorly, i just never knew exactly how much he meant to me until he went missing, and his brother told me the news a week later. 

i dont understand it. was it something i did to make this all happen? i was dealt a poor hand, is that just my luck or is it because i'm me? i dont get it. my world is completely upside down, and i dont know when its going to straighten itself back out. i dont even know if i'll be around long enough to see the day.",lonely,Turned 18 in June.,2020-08-05 12:44:40

2726,hellodarkness710,1596594976,1,"I've been alone for most of my life, pretty much ever since I was a kid in school. I was always the quiet one within the grade. I had classmates who let me tag along but they never really included me in anything and anytime I expressed any interest or excitement in anything that they did, or tried to share an interest of my own, I was shut down by weird stares and awkward silence. Basically, I was the definition of a wallflower when I was in school. Ever since then, I've learned to just keep all my interests to myself so that no one can use it against me to call me weird or a tryhard or whatever else. This means that I've never had friends who share common interests of men (or friends in general, really). 

So once in a while, when I get excited about new music or a new musical or whatever, I first look for reaction videos that will inevitably be posted onto YouTube and watch them to feel like I have friends to share my happiness with. And if I see something funny or stupid, I look for commentary videos on that topic so I can feel like I can be as annoyed with stupid things as I want without being clowned on for being a tryhard.",lonely,Sometimes I watch reaction/commentary videos to feel like I have friends to talk to.,2020-08-05 12:36:16

When lockdown started we were both visiting our parents houses and so were then stuck apart and then 2 months ago she stopped talking to me we would go days without talking and when I questioned her about it at the beginning of July she just out of nowhere said she no longer wanted to be with me or live with me, after some discussion (she wouldn't explain herself) I agreed I would move out as she can afford the rent by herself where as I can't... She then blocked my number, my Facebook, everything so I haven't had any contact with her at all since.

I left a note in our flat when I cleared out my stuff saying if I've left anything to call me and that I'm still always there for her if she needs me.

So every day for the past month everything I see and do reminds me of her, she's all I think about, I love her and I still have no answer to why she would do this to me, I feel so lost and alone and I have no idea what to do, it feels like I'm drowning and no one around me even notices never mind cares.

I'm now back living with my parents and younger sister, which after being moved out for 2 years is shit. They are lovely people but I have nothing in common with them at all and we barely talk, just say hi when we pass eachother around the house that's about it. 

I'm so so lonely that I can physically feel it it makes me feel sick and makes me feel unable to breath like my whole chest and throat are being squeezed and I just don't know what to do, I have only 1 friend I can even tell how I feel but she doesn't understand and just says useless things like 'you'll get over her' 'everyone feels like that sometimes', I know she's trying to help but it just doesn't help and I don't know what to do anymore.

It's been going pretty well, and I'm currently pretty content with what I have for the time being... considering Covid has put a little damper on certain aspects of socialization. 

So, here's my problem. I have basically been in some form of a romantic relationship for the past 2 years or so, which isn't all that long, but I am 19, so I consider it to be a pretty decent chunk of my life. Anyways, I mutually broke up with my boyfriend about a month ago now, because it just wasn't a good fit. I vowed that I wanted to improve myself and stay single for a while after that relationship though... so that's what I have been so diligently trying to do for the past month. It's been extremely difficult though. I've been hit with such a strong feeling of loneliness recently. I keep dreaming of my ex's and just constantly thinking about people I was with, or just plain thinking about getting into the dating game again. I keep smacking myself for it though, because I have yet to reach where I want to be for a relationship. I want a healthy relationship, and that requires me to grow and become happy within myself first.

2766,Th3_PC_6am3r117,1596558512,1,"Hello, I’m Brian I am 20 years old and my hobbies are PC Gaming, IT Tech stuff, etc. 

First things first: I have ASD Asperger Syndrome (a type of autism to be short) and feel the need to touch things as a stimulant and hair is the one i like the best. 

I like to touch hair by running my hands through it and feeling its texture. I don’t take hair touching as sexual, unless I’m in a sexual circumstance. However, my dick does get occasionally hard due to me enjoying the sensation. (Sorry, not something I want to happen it just does. I will try to contain that and stop that from happening if that makes you uncomfortable) 

Besides my hair obsession I will play videogames with you. Share funny videos with you. Play around with computer parts and more.

I just want to be 100% honest with you, as I highly value honesty. I would also like you to know that I suffer great discomfort from my parents and everyone else because I have been severely judged me for my hair obsession and they constantly tell me what’s wrong with me. All this stress has turned me into a selfish brat. Which, I want to work on. So, I hope I wont be a burden to you but rather an honest friend with a heart.

2771,StunningSmoke,1596554734,1,"Hello there!

For the past 2 years, I've had no one who I can deeply talk about my feelings too and what I have been going through. It's been tough staying alone that way. It was tough seeing everyone around me finding groups of people to hangout with, had their own inside jokes.

All i had were surface level friends. I had people around me but helping me enough to get through life. But I couldn't talk deeply about myself. Still, those were the friendships I had.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling blue lately and seeking refuge on the internet. Trying to stay away from the reality and myself.

I have been losing interest in playing video games too, so I browse reddit and youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a new computer recently and did not install any adblocker on it. I was constantly seeing this ad of a game 'Second Life'. I ignored it until today when something clicked in my mind.

I'm trying to stay away from reality to avoid hurting myself, and 'Second Life' sounds exactly what I need. So I hopped on r/secondlife, sorted by top all time to see what this game is all about. Scrolling and clicking through I found a long written post (titled ""Long Since Gone"") talking about how a decade ago that person had a life there, he had friends. Online friends. And now a decade later, most of them have left the game and s/he misses them.

&amp;#x200B;

The part that got my attention was,

&gt;...Even if it is true, **that's all the more reason to value every friendship you have in this short, difficult life we're given**; no matter what the medium. It's too easy to simply let a connection die on the vine because of a lack of time or convenience. I miss the friends I've lost, and likely won't ever see again.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I value the ones I can still speak to and see today. ...

It so true that it hurts.

I devalued my friendships with people who were not talking to me (but they talked to me once, some even months ago) because I thought that I'm not valued.

I wanted someone who would listen to me, support me, just be my friend. What if I was over expecting what friends are supposed to do? Maybe, to provide this level of emotional support is what relationships are for. Idk, never have been in a relationship, and also have been so close to one as if being in a relationship.

But what if my friends were also feeling the same way? What if they're also waiting for someone who values them to message them?

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen posts on this sub on how they just want someone to talk to and how people don't ask them how they are, or don't hangout with them.

Heck, this world is such that people won't ask if you're doing okay. They're too busy in their lives. I am too busy in my life. We're all too busy in our lives in some way.

Even if those friends did not hangout with me or I did not hangout with them, they were my friends. Because they were still the only ones I was close with. Maybe my bar of expectations of what friends are supposed to be is too high, that I got lost in the world of what my could-be ideal friends be and I started to down-value my existing friendships.

Even if they are not perfect, they are the ones that I currently have, and maybe I should value them.

And I think, that it is okay. I shouldn't devalue my friendships based on that.

*""Something is better than nothing.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Well, if I'm alone, I have no one to talk to, **I have the power to change that**. Maybe even give a restart to my old friendships.

The world right now is in such a mess, that anyone would be able to relate to what you are going through. And maybe even you can relate to what they are feeling. Chances are they'll turn out to be the person you need, and you'll be the person they need.

&amp;#x200B;

**I say if you are feeling lonely, go out and talk to whoever you are or have been most comfortable with.**

Make the first move, message them and start with some small talks.

Just a simple hi and ask them hows life going. Maybe even be to the point and honest. Say, ""I've had no one to talk, thought I'll check on what's up with you; Life's been really rough...""

Chances are, maybe even they needed a friend to talk to. Just like you need someone to talk to.

If all goes well, maybe you, maybe them or maybe you both will end up opening up and talking deeply about your lives.

If you don't want to talk to your old friends, I will persuade you to give it a shot, cuz, why not just do it if you got nothing to lose?

*""Do it, or don't do it — you will regret both.*""

&amp;#x200B;

I'll even update my post tomorrow to let you know how it went and how I'm feeling. But whatever happens, I won't let that positive connection between my friends die.

&amp;#x200B;

And now he's gone. I recognize that this is some sort of mental illness or breakdown on his part, but I just miss the person I used to know, so, so much. I want him back so, so much. I realize now that wasn't really him. The person I loved doesn't exist. He never meant the things he said to me or the promises he made. He's gone back to the life he claimed he was so happy to have left behind. Obviously, that is what he wants. Not me.

2800,username2J,1596522342,1,"It’s a feeling that’s hard to describe but we have all felt it before. It’s a familiar, good feeling that you have when you connect with someone, whether that be when you met your best friend or your lover. I can’t have this because I have made it my own fate to just not be able to have this. Sure I had my friends in the past, no lovers though and I will never expect any lovers. 

I live life doing what I want, usually listening to music or listening to music I made. Usual porn addictions, and playing video games. But now for years now, it’s being feeling like the only person I’ll ever be comfortable with is myself and it’s the price I have to pay when I get these moments of being/realizing how lonely I actually am, despite how more often than not I’m aching to be alone just so I can think in peace. 

It’s like a need in my mind, like in my head it’s like I’m documenting stuff yet I’m not documenting anything, and the attempts I made when it comes to actual writing I see as unrealistic and not possible. Mainly because of my laziness and how hard it is for me to keep a routine especially in this quarantine. I just do whatever I feel like doing these days and that involves drinking the beautiful poison that is alcohol when it is available. 

Lately though I have been cleaning around and when I’m done doing that it’s a nice feeling that you kinda accomplished something. Like it’s almost that feeling that you finally got out of a rut, you’re at the top of the ladder and things don’t have this unnerving sameness to it. Unnerving comfortableness I should say. Being stuck. 

I’m sure my writing right now is confusing and I should I go to sleep since it is two am as I write this. What I’m trying to explain is that I’m telling myself lately that there are a lot of lives in the world, and despite how I’ve basically made my life into how I can use anything, any little fault, and even people (in some instances) to make 
myself evermore upset, there’s still a surprising amount of scenarios playing out in the real world that I haven’t even imagined. 

Someone younger than me describe me as “self centered” and I love that description. Because I couldn’t figure out what words to use to describe myself and this person figured it out so quickly. 

I guess what I notice sometimes is how when I do try and write about this, there’s an off feeling inside me. A thought that makes me truly think that thinking so goddamn much is terrible. And there are prescription drugs made for you to not think so much (at least that what I think haha). I say it’s terrible because it gets to a point where it is just a realization of how I am just another life in a sea of lives. Because while it feels like I’m going so deep into my head the whole process of doing this is just something only the most self centered pathetic person who avoids people yet feels like he’s special can do.

2814,The-Ass-Assassin,1596513571,1,"I'm currently a student in high school. I don't consider myself appealing or attractive, and many people don't really want to talk to me in the first place.

A long time ago, I had some friends that I was with all the time. But over time, I started to realize that they treated me (and only me) like shit. I used to give them my stuff all the time because I wanted to be nice, to the point where I started giving them my food every day leaving me without anything to eat. I was fine with it, because I eventually adjusted to my new lifestyle of eating one meal per day.

Eventually, I came to a point where I realized that my friends were treating me in a horrible way and weren't actually happy to have me there. They were always using me to do things or get things from me. I wanted an escape, but I was too weak to do it openly because I was afraid things were going to turn out very badly. So, when the pandemic made all of us stay home, I made my escape. I deleted all of their contacts. And for the first week and a half, I was happy. I was finally free of them and actually gained a little confidence.

I even made it a little bit of a game. I would make it so the first person to send me a message (because I always messaged them first, every single time) would win, because that would mean they actually kinda cared about me.

I started all of this in March. It's now August. I've gotten nothing back. And since then, I've felt alone. I've felt alone and upset. I miss talking to people about things, but I don't want to go back to the horrible people I knew before who really didn't care about me.

I still feel happy from time to time. I recently went on a trip with my family around the country I live in, and I had a lot of fun. But I feel isolated. I feel, well, alone. I've gone onto online chat rooms to try and talk to people, but I wasn't very appealed and I was relatively grossed out. I never got to talk about something rich, or ever got to tell a story. And it can make me have short bursts of depression that can, and will, happen daily.

I just want to communicate with somebody. I want to tell them a story. I want to make them laugh. I just want to have friends and have a happy and healthy social life so I can feel better about myself and have the other person feel good too. My dad always told me that this was my prime time, and that I should be going out with friends and fucking around, maybe even getting into trouble. ""Living a little."" But I can't even get a conversation going with the other person interested.

God bless you if you read all this. I appreciate it. And I understand if you just want to move on and not worry about anything else. But I just want to be friends with somebody. I miss it, and I want to actually feel what it should feel like again.",lonely,Too young to be alone.,2020-08-04 13:59:31

A year ago I suffered major trauma. Stigma, shame, and fear kept me from telling anyone. For a year I have been pushing people away, masking my depression, trying to fight it, maybe beat it, alone. 


And I was failing. Majorly. I was on a brink of complete collapse, my mind refusing to take another step forward. I didn't see a way out, I had no one to tell, no one to help me. My mind was overwhelmed, so close to shutting down. I even choose a date in a calendar. I was that close to...just being done with it. 


But..as fate would have it. Few days prior to that date...

I met him. 

I met that one person who will mean a world to you. Who will help you as much as you help him. 
Who will lend you his strength to carry the burden with you, not minding his own baggage. 
Who will read your mind and mood and do the exactly the right thing at every moment. 
Who will take care of you when you are feeling so down you don't see a way back up. 

I know how it sounds. Impossible. 
That's exactly what I tought. But here I am, still with you. I didn't have anything else to lose, so I let one chance in. I let him in, allowing a small glimmer of trust to form... 
And I am so damn glad I did that. 


I know some of you have been struggling for WAY longer than me, but that is not the point. I know some of you may not see this as inspiration.. But some of you, I hope, will. 

The point is...there is someone out there for you.

This is sort of a reach, postiing on Reddit. I thought perhaps someone may be able to help. Who knows!?

I am completely on my own. No friends or family. Nobody that cares at all, or would notice me vanish.

My mum tried to kill herself several times when i was a kid. She'd call me while i was staying with my dad and describe how she was being beaten by her then husband.

I was severly bullied in school, ate lunch in the toilets almost everyday. Was constantly scared.

Moved home so many times, each time losing all contact with any friends.

Ended up moving to America at 15 with my Dad and his wife. For first time ever i had friends and an awesome life. All the time planning on one day avenging my Mom and what happened to her.

\~I would occasionally have these 'weird' moments where i would say to myself ''Im actually here right now''. I would then get the most weird out of mind feeling that i was a forign object and was totally out of place. But would 'zone' back in withing minutes and would all be forgotten.

My first year in america was crazy. I wont go into too much detail, but i was expelled from military school. Got into trouble with the law and had to sspend 2 months in juvenile detentioin facility.

So my dad moved us to another state. I lost my girlfriend, and a friend i was so close to i considered my brother. I had to go to 'Alternative school' for a whole year. Thi9s is a school for criminals to go to before reentering public school systems. For the record, my crime was vandalism.

I meet a new girl and 2 new close friends. For 2 years I have what i describe to be the best time of my life. My mind is constantly in the moment, with no caree for what i was causing my parents. I stopped coming home and started to live moment by moment. Id lie to stay at friends houses, sometimes even attributing it to my Dad and Stepmom. (i loved my dad more than life but never showed him) At this point my parents think i hate them and are getting increasily pissed off with me) But all i could think about was picking up my girlfriend and just letting things move along. Every day was crazy. We were a very close unit. I had my whole life pklanned out with this group of friends. 

I ended up getting into more trouble. This time a bit more serious. But my mind just blocked ou the world constabtly and all i thought about was my girlfriend and friends. It was all about keeping the happiness flowing constantly. We had dated for 3 years and i took my gf to a lovely spot andproposed to her. She said Yes:D   24 hours later im on a plane back to the UK never to return. That was the end of that chapter of my life. I would never see or talk to any of those friends or love again.

&amp;#x200B;

So all of a sudden im back in England. My mum i picking me up from the airport and introducing me to her new bf. I thought this is my time to be there for my mum and never let anything happen to her. 

3 weeks later her bf made her decide between me and him. She picked the boyfriend.  He couldn't deal with me crying everyday and missing america. I moved into my nans caravan. 

My dad tells me i will be back in america in 2 years. Just to work hard and stay out of trouble until then. I thought wow, this is great!

I started to 'hang out' with a neighbobur and his friends. Smoking alot of weed. I started drinking and partying alot. I just could not be in silenmce or on my own. I constantly had to be with friends. It felt good.

Well i told my nan 'I wish you would hurry up and die'. At the time she was an alcoholic and would throw ashtrays at me.  I loved her though, more than words could describe. Alas, i got kicked out and had to move into a flat share with a total stranger.

I lost all contact with my mum and nan. My mum refused to see me due to her bf. Even afeter accidentally cutting myself and needing stiches, she didn't care.

So in the flatshare im now in, I start to talk to my Dad more, who is still in America. He wants me to join the merchant navy and sets up interviews in Glasgow and Isle of Mann. So i travelled to these on my own and handled them. I got accepted but didn't join as i hate the Sea and had no wish to join. Besides i was told Id be home soon (back in America). 

I didn't get aloing with the landladies son. I had leant him money to get to work and he didn't want to pay me back. He had a grduge againt me as i was living with his mom and sleeping in his old room. I just wanted to help, but needed the money back. So we had a non physical argument. I cam home later that day to see all my belonging on the side of a main [road. It](https://road.It) was very stressful. Luckily at the time i had made a good friend named 'Mitchell' who helped me move my belongings via taxci to his moms house.

Mitchells Mum kindly allowed me to sleep on his living room floor for a couple of months. During this time i was looking for work and somewhere to live. My mum actually lived on the same road. I walked to her house and knocked on the door. She came out and i asked if i could move in for a few weeks. She gave me a pillow and sent me on my way.

I finally found somewhere to live. A houseshare with 4 rooms. The first few months were horrible. I hated living on my own. In the back of my mind i was just here waiting until i could go back to my true home in America. So i didnt commit to any sort of future. I didn't work on anything. I was relying on bennefits and money from my Dad. I would literally just wait for the days my friend Mitchel could come over. Sometimes having to bribe him to stay longer. Yes i was very lame.

The next year was a bit better. I made friends with someone in the house share. He was 10 years older than me, but very cool and relatable. I started drinking everyday. Sometimes from when i wake up. 

During this time i was lucky enough to meet a girl. A very special girl. We became bestfriends over night. Doing everything together. I took her to see plays in London. She was super smart and planning to go to university.

Anyway I started selling weed to get off bennefits. This lead to one day waking up to a loud bang. My housemates door was kicked in. At this time this was Mitchell, the good friend i spoke about earlier. I picked up a weight and opned my door. It was 2 guys. Both known for knife crime and stabbings. They took all my belongings and threatned to comeback for the rest. For the next few nights they were huge gangs of people downstairs waiting for the door to open. It was scary. I still went out with my girlfriend but would have to be very careful. It got worse and i ended back at Mitchels Moms house living on the living room floor. 

Back on the floor, i start an online Legal business. Selling wristbands and tshirts. I signed off bennefits and started to support myself. I found making money very easy. Every single day Im still thinking about America and my friends and family there. Still i carry on.

My best friend in America passed away, i found out on Facebook. This was a HUGE blow. I loved him.  Anyway i carried on. 

I deceided to help Mitchell make money too. So offered him to partner with me. I just had to teach him to want to make money etc. Something i could never achieve.

My girlfriend moved to Exeter and i followed with Mitchell, moving into our own flat in Exmouth.  The last chapter was behind me. I had a girlfriend, a best friend i lived with and a future to look forward to. I helped Mitchell for the first few years with bills and rent. He cuold never reallyt get into business, i kept on making money though. I didn't mind as he was a brother to me at this point. Id have taken him with me to the ends of the earth, regardless of my gf.

Well my girlfriends parents gave her an ultimatum. Break up with me or have tuition pulled. So she came over to mine one day, slept with me and left. I haven't seen or spoke to her since. One day we were madly in love, the next she is gone for goood.

I struggled for about a year to get over it. It was horrible.

I managed to get Mitchell a job and things turned into an 8 year long daily routine. 

Wake up around 3pm. Do work on my online business. Wait for Mitchell to get off work. Watch tv go to sleep. REPEAT.

We did everything together. We planned to move abroad. As i have always seen England as just a stop off.  I would have taken him to the end of the world with me. 

I start to create a way for my mind to ignore deeply destressing issues. Id simply build a box in my mind and anything i didnt want to think about would be placed inside.

I still belived Id go home one day. Mitchell would come with me!

I was very depressed the whole time. I started to talk to my Gp about it. But wouldn't progress further than being told to get out more.

after about 7 years, i decided i should call my Dad. He pretended not to know me. I blocked this out. But it killed me. I worship my dad, he just doens't know it. I don't allow anyone to talk porrly about him etc

But i keep my head down and stick to the routine. 

Me and Mitchell make the plan to move to Spain. Start a new life. Run a busisness together..

I get a dog. His name is Khan. I love him to bits. He helpos me to leave the flat every day. 

At this point im about 28. My only social interactions are going to the shops and seeing other dopg walkers. Mitchell is my only friend, the only person i trust. I have noone else. My family have disowned me at this point. They just dont care at all.

It starting to sink in that I wont be returning home to America ever. Depression gets worse. But i cope and stick to the routine. 

All im trying to do the whole time is set Mitchell up to make loads of money on his own online business. Which i actually presented him with business' he could take over and make money from straight away. None of which he cares about. 

Mitchell meets a girl. All of a sudden the ROUTINE is brokken. No longer am i at home waiting for him to get oiff work. I see him abuot 2 days a week, even on those its mostly passing decorum. LLoneliness really starts to hit me, to the point im crying every day, without telling anyone. 

Mitchell tells me that now he has met someone i need to sort myself out as hes moving away from her regardless of me and what ive done for him. I understand thats toitally normal,m but im facing true disconnection from the world.

All plans are out the window for the future and my days become a fight to get to the end and go to bed. I keep my mind busy by gaming and wrking every day all day long.

Im now 30. I don't really have a friendship with Mitchell anymore and hes planning to move out soon. He told me i will get over it. Im now in a black hole sinking fast. 

3 months ago something happened with my eyes while watching tv, I had great pain trying to move them and couldnt stay foccussed on anything. I had a constant numb head and didn't know what was going on. Life all of a sdden became thing about my eyes 24-7. Nothging felt right. Nothing looed right. Everything hurt my eyes. 

I went to AandE 3 days in a row trying to get help. It was very stressful. I had a molar tooth removed as i thought that may be causing it. I went to an optician, an eye doctor and a chiropractor. Even had a CT scan. Nothing helped. Each day im beliveing something else is wrong with me. From brain tumor to eye strain. Even beliveing its all just iin my head. This wholetime its all ive thought about. 

In the last couple of weeks, I'm not sure when exactly Ive disconnected myself from reality. I seems it could be derealisation, not positive as im no doctor. Which lead me to this subreddit. Reading through everyones experiences. I decided I'd post mine.

It started with looking out the wondow. Nothing seemed 'right' Like something was wrong wqith my vision. Mythoughts seems fine. Depressive, but thats just normal. 

It got worse a few days ago. I woke up and stood in my living room staring at a wall for hours, while deep in thought. 'Zoned out'.

I found myslef completely zoning out while doing all tasks and losing myself. Everytime i started to think abuot reality it seems off. Something is really wrong. I feel like Im dreaming, or looking through someones elses eyes. 

The only time i feel normal is when reading, watching tv or scrolling on my phone. 

I can't eat, shop, walk or do anything without feeling this anymore Its taken over 1000% of my life. Even brushing my teeth i feel like im not there. Its like im in a permanent 'zone out'. Its made me consider killing myself, which ive done many times but never so seriously. Which lead me here, sort of like a last stand. Maybe someone can relate and talk to me. Maybe someone can offer some words of advice. Im not too sure. 

All i know is that In a few months im living on my own and will have 0 perople in this world im connected to. Im TERRIFIED. On top of that realisation i have to contend with the derealisation thing im going through. It makes it an even more scary concept to be living on my own.

Im worried i will feel like this for the rest of my life. Which also leads me to thoughts of suicide. Nobody cares at all. I mean you get the small talk, 'feel better bro' 'Dont talk about suicide thats silly'. It kills me. I have absolutely not a single person who cares abuot me anymore. I dont want to force relationships and go out to meet random people. Im 30 now..

Every 5 seconds or so its like my brain just refreshes to the singular thought 'wow im actually here, this is weird. i feel weird'. Ive always got myslef through situations, ive always been quite proud of myself. But i feel like ive lost all that strength. Its just gone.  I don;t know if things will every return to normal again. All i know is that its taking all of my strength just to get out of bed and walk/talk etc.

I can;t walk down the orad, everything is totally weird. I just stop and stare at things. I went out for a few days with Mitchell and his gf but just felt out of it all the time. Even when someone is talking to me im zoned out in my head. Mostily missing whats said to me.

Im sure nobody will want to sit though and read about my silly life. But if anyone does, Thank you! I reall appreciate you from the bottom of my heart.

All i have to give is love. I feel like all i do is help people and care about people, without anyone to do the ssame for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I may have over shared, i just wanted to give the Whole story so to speak. Even though i missed alot out..

&amp;#x200B;

While writing i dont feel the 'zoned out' feeling. But as soon as i stop it hits me like a car.

&amp;#x200B;

I look forward to hearing your opinion. If you;re someone going through something similar, my love and time are yours!

2854,slabcobbey,1596485261,1,"I used to have a lot of friends when I was younger, we would always hang out and stuff like that. I began losing contact with people when I was around 14-15. We wouldn’t hang out after school, only during school. It felt like I was being left out because they would always do stuff without me after school but during school we were always together.
My closest friend began meeting new people then left me as a side friend which then led to us having no contact after going to different highschools.

I made some ”friends” in highschool but I had the same problem as before, they would always do stuff without me outside of school. The only things we did was being together in school and play games outside of school. 
The same ”friends” were always talking shit about me behind my back which I didn’t realize until after 1 year which led me to stick with 1 friend that I really liked. We had really good contact but it slipped away after we graduated, which is my fault which I will come back to later.

The thing that hurt me the most during the years was that people were always doing stuff without me, then seeing how fun they have together and posting it on social media. The thing that hurt me even more was that they would always talk about stuff that they did together to me, like oh we did this we did that, and I didn’t even get asked to go with them. There were times they said that I can come along next time but it never happened, not even once, they just forgot about it and I didn’t want to be annoying to remind them to bring me along.

The friend that I lost contact with after we graduated was skipping most time of the last semester which led to him asking me if I can give him essays and homework that he missed in school because he wasn’t there. He was skipping school and asking me for my essays to give while I was being left alone at school. He would always hit me up to talk about his feelings and only talk to me when he was feeling down.
I had a friend from my last school that also went to my highschool together with me but in a different class but he would also just hit me up when he was feeling down which led to me feeling used.

I am now 20 years old and I have no idea what to do, I really want to reconnect with my friend but I have ghosted him for several months now and it feels like something deep inside me doesn’t let me contact him because I am afraid to be used again like before. The other friend I mentioned from my last school, we have known eachother for around 8 years and we haven´t hung out once during those years, but we would always get along in school. 

I have no idea why I have always been left out, I´m a normal guy and there is nothing wrong with me. I have been depressed for 1-2 years now because I am feeling alone, no no one wants to do anything with me, no one asks me how I am, people only hit me up because they are feeling down. I have no idea how to meet new people, it feels like I want to start over in life or start a new life, I even think about if I could go back in time to keep my friends but I have no idea of what I did or what made them drift away from me.

It feels like I only hung out with people maybe at max 20 times in 5 years.

I used to be very social when I ways younger but after these years it feels like I am a completely different person, I don´t even know who I am anymore. I can´t even hold a normal conversation anymore because I barely have any contact outside of my family.

Until the other day, I literally haven't met up with and talked to another human being since February (outside of conference calls for work). I'm working from home so at least work is keeping me distracted

I've never really had friends. I was homeschooled so I've never been exposed to people socially until my adult years when I started working

It's really starting to get me down. Nobody cares about me. I don't really have family (we're not on good terms) and I definitely don't have any friends or anybody I can speak to. I feel like I've always had this problem, but lockdown has amplified it

The loneliness gets so bad that every Friday and Saturday night, I walk a 5 mile round trip to the town centre, just to walk through town and observe other people having a good time and interacting with their friends... I know it's pathetic

Now, here's the thing: I've attempted every piece of practical advice I can find, and none of it has worked. I'm trying to put myself out there.

Example: the other day I got invited to an awards dinner by the mayor of the town to be awarded a certificate (I've done some volunteering during the pandemic) alongside some other volunteers. I hit it off with a couple other people and we exchanged contact details. I messaged them, and they messaged back. I replied and they saw it and never responded. This was Wednesday. I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong

The crazy thing is, I get on with everybody I meet. I've been told I'm confident and easy to talk to, and I always have a really good time talking to people in passing. But nothing substantial ever comes from it. I've never managed to build a meaningful friendship after meeting someone

I was really patient with my best friend when she was going through a breakup a few months ago. I was on the phone with her for hours and tried my best to be there for her, even though I was dealing with my own depression too. But since my breakup, she has been really busy and stressed with her own life (she is moving into her first apartment). I text her how she’s doing and how the move is going and she doesn’t respond, even though I can see she’s active on other social media. 

I’ve tried to reach out to some other friends, but they’ve been kinda dodgy in their responses (either not responding at all or ending the convo quickly). My friends all know that I am going through a breakup, and they know I struggle with mental health. 

I just wish that at least one of my friends would reach out and ask if I’m ok, or that one of them would just want to talk. It doesn’t have to be about me, in fact it would be better if we talked about them because then it would distract me from my own problems. I am just so lonely. 

I feel like I’m so needy, but also, my instinct is telling me they don’t care about me as much as I care about them. I don’t even know where to start when it comes to making new friends.",lonely,"Am I excessively needy, or do my friends just not care about me? Or both?",2020-08-04 05:24:57
2862,_jkc,1596481460,1,"Hi there. This is one of my first times posting on Reddit so sorry if this is a mess.

I’m a  from Toronto. All my life I’ve always struggled to get along with people well and/or find people who genuinely share the same interests as I do and when I finally do, I’ve pushed them away. I literally only have one person in my life who I’m close with that’s not my family and that’s my partner.

It makes me feel like shit when I scroll through IG and see all these people having fun together, many of which I used to be friends with or just close with in general. And while I don’t really miss being friends with these people, I miss the idea of them and the idea of having a solid group of friends.

I do have social anxiety, and have struggled on and off with depression, but most consistently I’ve always just felt really alone even if there has been points in time where I’ve had a lot of people around me that could be considered my friends.

I’m learning as time goes on that maybe my loneliness does just come down to my mentality, and most definitely I am finally improving and ready to put myself out there again but I’m finding that I have no outlet to do it and just want to genuinely find people who have the same interests as me.

Soooo yeah. Here I am! If you like any of the following please hit me with a message, I’d love to talk: Music (mostly alternative/rock such as: Beastie Boys, RHCP, foo fighters, green day, nirvana, etc. But always open to new music!). Bass. ATLA. Comics (mostly DC specifically anyone under the Batfam, but MCU for life). Art. Fashion. YouTube. Video games. General random facts about the world. Going on adventures at night

I spent the last year gaining self confidence and becoming the person i wanted to be for years (albeit a couple trust issues and anxieties). But recently a couple incidents lead to a falling out with almost all of my friends. Now due to covid changing many things, I’m facing a 6 month period ahead of me where I’m going to be almost completely alone. 

I know it sounds pathetic that I’m so scared of 6 months, but my ego has really taken a hit and my old anxieties are pouring in big time rn and it’s been only a month. So I’m worried that all of the progress I made over the past year to become the person I want to be is unraveling and I don’t know how to stop it. 

So I ask, how do I prevent this... or can I even prevent it? How do I become not ashamed of having no friends? How do I keep all of the old anxieties at bay so I don’t consume myself and go full hermit like I used to be? I mean I know probably no one really has any answers but I thought I’d ask anyways.

I am looking for a man. 
I am looking for someone to take care of me, and in return me take care of them. 
I guess you can say more of a ‘old school’ relationship. 
I am looking for a breadwinner, in a sort. 
Not that I do not like to work and support myself. 
I have been single for a while, and am happy as that. 
But I would love to find someone who has the same views of a relationship as I do. 
I want to fall in love, take care of my man, have dinner on the table when he comes home from work, take care of the house, and whatever my man needs done. 
Think... old school relationship.

2899,OccamsNeedle,1596440672,1,"This is partially to vent and partially a cry for help/advice. My world feels dark and dystopic. I feel this intense amount of loneliness while also experiencing an intense amount of social anxiety. It's like I'm glad when someone talks to me but at the same time I feel like running away as soon as they do. This isn't all though, because I feel heavily disinterested in others. What would I find interesting in someone else? I don't even know. 

I recently lost a 7 year relationship where she was my only friend. She connected with me at a very deep level and I think feeling understood was enough for me. Yes, we shared interests but at other times we didn't necessarily. I adapted my interests to fit her, but I never felt like I was forcing myself. I was happy just enjoying something, anything, together. At the end of the relationship I hadn't realized a lot of that connection had been severed for some time. Now, even taking a step outside of my place gives me a massive amount of anxiety because I feel so alone.

Whenever I've tried talking to anyone, including on here, it's always about liking similar things. I get it, because if you play the same games, watch the same shows, or have the same hobbies then it's something to talk about. Thing is, I don't feel like I have strong interests overall. My only interests have to do with trying to help others and I can only talk a lot more when I'm trying to help another. Whether it's physical or mental. I can play anything, watch anything, or listen to anything. Sometimes it's the opposite and I can't do any of those things at all. 

I'm currently a pre-med student who's also detouring into nursing and as such I've been unbelievably busy. I don't know the latest things, slang, memes, or social media. To be honest, I've never had a strong interest to follow trends, but it also doesn't mean I won't laugh or enjoy them with someone. 

I honestly believe that at this rate I will be completely alone for the rest of my life. I don't just want to try to please people to stave off my loneliness. But, I wouldn't even know what to talk about if it was completely up to me. I feel like I'm only there when I'm ""needed."" Nothing more though. Even my relationship had started due to the fact that she was someone I was trying to help. 

I'm not really asking for DM's, I'm open to them, but I don't know how to truly carry on a conversation. We probably won't share much in common since I feel like I live in a sort of void. Even so, those random conversations about games, music, or whatever seem to be missing something. It just doesn't fill the emptiness I feel and then I can't speak.

Most recently, a girl I liked, and maybe still do (currently trying to kill any feelings) told me that she liked me and wanted a relationship. We went to the cinema together, it was nice, but she didn't see it as a date



That last one hurt the most




I don't have anything against these girls, I genuinely don't have a problem with them. It just hurts, the cycle of pain repeating always




Point is, I've accepted my singleness. Although I desperately crave being with a girl I can hug, hold hands with, run my fingers through her hair, press her against me, be completely open and vulnerable with , kiss, and offer all of this to her, I know that's never going to happen.





I've never held hands with a girl, never kissed a girl before. Any kisses I get will be out of pity or due to alcohol.

I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this so I guess I’ll post it here. For some context im 24, m, and still a virgin/ never had a gf. 

recently my loneliness has been hitting harder than usual, with sporadic bouts of depression (I went to a psychiatrist to get evaluated but they never told me if I was depressed, because “label’s arent important “ or something. so I guess I have it? idk). 

Over the years i’ve had on and off “swings” with females some would last weeks some months and one time a year.inevitably they lose interest because I’m boring and don’t initiate anything (cause ive never had a gf idk what to do). these girls I usually met at or from work.

and now this year I dont even have anyone to hangout with or talk to. well there is one girl(from work) but she is busy with school and probably doesn’t like me anyways. 

so I try online apps, and for 6months - year straight on bumble and tinder I have been:

1. blocked
2. ghosted
3. ignored 

over 50 times. and I get maybe 1 like a month if I leave locations on. and no offense but these girls aren’t my type and im not chad but Im not gonna lower my standards. just recently ive tried to be more open minded with girls who I normally wouldn’t go after and after chatting for a bit, I ask if she uses snapchat to message, and then she ghosts me. so a day later I check up and shes ignores. then I check a day later and she blocks me. mind you a week earlier this happened with another girl...

meeting girls through apps has been a horrible experience for me and has taken a toll on me mentally, especially on my self esteem. ive decided to give up on apps completely.

and now I cant stop thinking about my past mistakes with girls that I actually had a chance with IRL, and I get sad to think of how I messed up and ruined it, and I could have a gf now and be happy.

I feel like i’m never gonna meet anyone. I feel like this world isnt made for me. all I want is a girl to cuddle with and to have a supportive girlfriend who helps you grow into a better person. I want someone to spend time with outside doing things like going to the lake, swimming , going hiking, camping, etc.

and please dont say “work on yourself” I dont want to hear that. Ive been alone 24 years and I have a right to be upset and not be content. and I dont feel complete..I feel exhausted. I’m so exhausted being alone and I just want to feel whole. does anyone have any advice for me to help me get a girlfriend or dates? thanks and sorry for the long post.",lonely,I feel like I’m gonna be alone forever and idk what to do,2020-08-03 16:21:18

I am someone who likes to animate and create 3D models from time time while also creating renders of whatever game series im interested. The problem with that is that i've mostly phased out from those hobbies, and I want to get back to them but I simply struggle to find the motivation to do so.

When I was younger I used to do my hobbies almost 24/7 after school and whenever I had the time because they were one of the few activities at the time that I didn't really need friends for. As I grew up however, it's been very hard to get back into them. These days I don't animate nor create 3D models. I just import whatever model from a game and convert into a blender compatible state to create renders and even then I am left unsatisfied with everything I make.

These days I try to get motivation by looking at posts in Art Station. Problem is that it's only temporary, and I can't seem to really helpy myself out. I've also been going outside and cycle around for a couple of miles to clear my head of things but that's also temporary as I can't get rid of this sense of dread.

Im posting this here because I don't really have anyone to talk to about this.

On top of that, these past weeks have been rather stressful for me.

I won't put in a long post that I normally do but I am looking for people to be prospective friends with. Not just generalized friendships but **only for people in specific backgrounds**, and I'm rolling the hard six to see if I have any prospective success on this one *(which I've had in the past).* I've developed an acute sense of trust in people who have a greater tendency to understand the unspoken dysfunction of my experiences as well as me being very understanding in their own experiences, when most people in the civilian world would be bothered by it or be driven away. And so right now, I only have so few people that I'd consider talking, mostly online. My once partner whom I just broken up with a lot of tears on my end *(we were two different people with differing goals in life)* and another prospective male friend *(former Navy who was an IA)* who has earned my trust. However, I've started the process not long ago of making new connections for friendships... the type where we'd be actively there for each other... nurturing strengths as well as weaknesses. If I have to be honest, I'm trying to emulate it in a manner where my once partner made me a priority in his life... but friendships can't be forced. So I'll see how this goes with other guys.

Those who are **current or former LEOs** ***(law enforcement officers)*****/military,** I hope we can establish some sort of correspondence. **Also to some extent, open to any first responders** ***(EMT's/firefighters)*****.** You can talk to me about the patients which bothered the crap out of you and as a student RN, got a couple of stories too I can share that have made me remember fondly or rather stories of just rude people in general... to just being comfortable around each other and throw out to the wind what it is we want to talk about. If you have any interests that involve shooting, hunting etc. by all means, I am open to making connections with guys with those experiences.

Now, in part due to my law enforcement/military-oriented interests/hobbies, it won't be doing me any favors to have any fellow females try to understand me. I will be honest though in that I have a greater sense of distrust among women than men due to personal experiences so any females interested, sorry.

PM if you might fit the bill and tell me some things about yourself... the more you write other than a ""Hey"", the more likely I get to respond to your message in kind. Ideally and preferably, you are very open-minded and someone who is also willing to do have voice calls as a major part of communication. I am looking for a long-term correspondence and very open to frequent voice calls/messaging which is what I usually prefer.

I have no friends, and even when I try to reach out to people they ignore me or become flakey. I'm an only child, and I'm scared that when my parents pass away, I will be completely alone.

I'm a female in my 20s and I have come to a point in my life where I feel so empty. I see people my same age on social media traveling, partying, getting an amazing job, getting into relationships, having fun with friends etc..

I feel like I have completely wasted my 20s because I haven't done much to look back later and say: ""Damn, I did enjoy my life"". I literally have no friends. Now, I am NOT an introvert. I love to socialize and talk to people and I do talk to a lot of people, but at the end of the day they're just ""acquaintances"". When I try to reach out to them to make plans to hang out, they either ignore my messages or become flakey. Sometimes I feel like I am unlikeable because no one wants to establish a ""hanging out"" type of friend relationship. It confuses me so much because when I talk to people, I get the sense that they like me because they laugh at my jokes and get my humor etc..

Not that I am putting myself up on a pedestal, but I consider myself a REALLY loyal person. Like if someone needs advice, help, or just a hug I will be there because I don't want anyone to feel lonely like I have. I feel like people have taken advantage of me because of that. Like they need me for a little bit, and then when they're done using me, I never hear back from them or hear back from them rarely.

Sometimes I feel so lonely, that I talk to myself because I need to hear someone's voice. I know I sound crazy, but when I am alone at home, I pretend like I have a friend that I'm talking to and I am telling them about my day or about my life. No, I don't have an imaginary friend, I just talk to myself as if someone was there while I am doing stuff around the house.

I see people on social media partying and having fun with tons of friends etc.. I wish I could do that too. Not to show off to other people, but because I want to have fun experiences that I can later remember.

I know social media isn't a representation of real life, but there has to be some truth to what these people are posting. Like I don't think people take pictures with random strangers at parties, if they aren't their friends.

I am just so upset. I want to have fun experiences and have friends I can at least talk to. I still live with my parents, never have had a boyfriend, and never have had someone I can call a ""true"" friend. I have been pretty blessed in my life, I can't complain. I have travelled to 15 countries and speak 4 languages (English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French). I graduated college and I am financially independent, meaning that I contribute with the bills etc.. I also have worked in 2 government-owned departments.

I have only been to a club thrice, and had my first kiss there and my first sex experience, but it was all so awkward. When I look back at those 'fun' moments, I cringe with embarrassment because they were SO incredibly embarrassing. Like when I had sex, the only reason why I did it was because I wanted to say I had done something everybody else my age was doing, but it wasn't fun at all. Yes, some moments were a little fun, and yes, I know I have been blessed with traveling and speaking different languages, but my experiences have been few and far between.

I know my parents love me with all their heart, and I know they worry about me being lonely when they're gone (I'm an only child). I worry about they day they both pass away, because I will literally be alone. Like I have no one, and they are my rock. Although I love them with all of my heart, I want to have a life separate from them. Like if I ever go out, I either go out by myself, or with them. I just wish I could go out with a friend or two. Like I said, I love my parents, and I love their company, but I need to hang out with people my age.

I don't understand how people make friends so quickly. Like I said, I am not an introvert. I have no problem starting up a conversation with someone and having a good connection. It's just that the connection doesn't seem to go any further because even if I try to reach out, they seem to not want to establish a deeper connection.

I'm sorry this post was so long. If anyone reads this and has read up to this point, thank you so much &lt;3",lonely,"I'm in my 20s, have no friends, and haven't done anything with my life",2020-08-03 11:30:11

2949,Godseye009,1596408210,1,"I met this girl a year and a half back when nothing seemed working for me. The first time I saw her, nothing invoked inside.
Maybe that was normal from my part.
She is a classmate who used to belong to a group whom we all hated. That might be one of the reasons why I didn't interested in her on my 1st year of College.
The first time I got to get along with her was during a group project. She turned out to be wholesome, which I didn't really expect.We started to hang around, go for coffee and talk for hours.
I somehow got into a new circle, where my and her friends got along with each other pretty well.
It was going all fine until I started thinking about her 24/7. I didn't know whether it was okay to think like this way.
I started to talking to her more frequently, had deep late night conversations and even bunked classes together to spend time with each other.
I was feeling like she might be the one.Then, I got to know her real face.
I couldn’t hold so many things inside me, so I expressed things about her to my closest friend who is like a brother to me.
Fortunately, he knew her true colors and warned me to not get too close to her.
I didn't listen. I started trying more close to her and despite knowing that I like her she didn't stop me right then.
She made fun of my feelings, joked about my background in her circle.
I was a fool to think that she had something for me. Until the day came, when infront of everyone she introduced me to her boyfriend despite knowing everything. 
It was my mistake to fall for a wrong person.But you don't choose who to fall for. 
Do you?
After that, lot of things good and bad things happened in my life. Still, trying to coping up and getting over her.
Maybe, she could've handled things different. Maybe at least for the sake of friendship she could've avoided me. I was completely okay with she rejecting me but not in that way purposefully in front of people who knew everything.

I’m 18 now and I just feel sad all the time. I’ve always had little to no friends since I was a child. I would spend my lunch time when I was kid playing yugioh or Pokemon with myself, or just watching everyone else play, i spent all of elementary school and high school just being so lost and lonely, and a lot of days with tears. Yeah I got good grades but that doesn’t buy happiness.

I was also obese when I was around 7-15 but I decided to lose all that weight once I turned 16 after the doctor kept telling me I won’t be able to walk by time that I was 20 (ha I proved them wrong I went from 130kg to 79KG)

My dad was my best friend and we would do everything together but i only got to see him over the summer since my mom and my dad did not live together. They aren’t divorced, but they just can’t live together for specific reasons. They are always fighting all the time now and it just makes me feel sad always especially since they are both growing old. 

I look to god for hope. I feel he’s the only one these days I can talk to. I just feel so lonely all the time and isolated all the time. I don’t have social anxiety but I just seem to have this self hatred for myself for some reason. Like I’m not good enough to be around people or to be myself. I also have severe health anxiety because I would go to the doctor almost every month when I was around 8-14 because of my weight 

I haven’t talked to anyone since quarantine. People are catching up with friends since lockdown ended and I’m just here.

I moved to the US back in February and with work and COVID I haven’t been able to meet a lot of people. When I moved I only knew 2 people who are my siblings. Because of the pandemic I’ve had to switch jobs very frequently, making my relationships with people very short-lasting. Then the friends I do have leave me on read or delivered when I ask them about their day or whatever else. 
Went on several dates with a cute girl, who I met on a online dating app, even cuddled and kissed and I got the courage to ask her if she wanted to officially date, she says to me that she wasn’t looking for a relationship and “sorry for leading you on” and then promptly ghosted me. 
I don’t blame her because it’s her decision and her life, but my mental health has declined because of what has happened. The lack of physical interaction, not sex but holding hands, cuddling, kisses, tight hugs has made me touch starved and what happened with that girl broke me down even more. 

Yesterday was a hard day, I was exhausted all day long even though I slept over 8 hours I still took two naps even though I didn’t do really anything during the day, when I push myself to go outside to skateboard around and clear my head, not even getting out of the driveway I hit a pebble making me fall forward and hurting my knee bad enough that it’s bleeding and I can’t apply too much pressure on it because it hurts pretty bad. I go in to watch a movie by myself and when the movie is only 30 minutes to end, my roommates come in with friends and they start talking about the movie and about other things, making it not possible to watch the movie.

2) I never had a good childhood and my parents never loved me, I have been Mentally and Physicaly assaulted by my Mom, Dad and my 18 year old Awful brother. I'm moving out soon once I get my degree from college because in the country I live in, it's hard to move out of parents house before 22 and nobody gives you a place to work or live when they find out you left your family because in this country, people value family bonding more but my family is so messed up that I wanna leave this house soon once I get my degree soon because this Hatred and Assault is something I have been bearing since the past 21 years I wanna get rid of soon. And I hope you understand after reading the above two points why I don't have friends as well. I'm the most hated one in this family. My mom is a narcissist who thinks she and her loving son is a superhero while I'm the bad guy always even when they are the ones who hurt me always.

3) I have been through a severe state of dark depression wherein I have attempted suicide a lot of times and was bipolar too until the age of 18 but then I told myself ""Why should I hurt myself? Just because these peplle ahte me and hurt me? Why does everything they say affect me? Because deep down i know what I'm capable of but I have been giving up on me just because of them but well now that has to change and I won't kill myself for them to win because it's my life, I'm living it and they don't get to decide how I should feel  or live as!""

A happy life with no pain and no sorrows with the one I wanna spend my whole life with, whose smile would brighten up my my day and whose happibess becomes the warmth and the cool breeze to my heart that calms my soul.

Honestly everyone feels lonely, truthfully some more than others. But loneliness can be addicting and turn into self pity which makes it easier to believe that you are the victim. And sometimes you are when you have crippling mental illness, for example, like how I lost a lot of friends due to my social anxiety and depression that I developed. In that case, you should seek help/ go to therapy and go on meds if it’s anything severe but my advice would be to work on the root cause of the issue no matter how difficult rather than just take meds and hope it’ll be alright. And if you can’t see a therapist, pick up healthy coping habits like journaling or find some self help work books online. But also a lot of times it just means that you have to take control of your situation and once you start working on yourself whether it be physically but most importantly, mentally, other things start fall into place. I’m not saying that you’ll become the most popular person or never feel loneliness again but at least you’ll be able to just simply like being with yourself. It fucking sucks being alone all the time and on top of that, constant negative self talk makes it even unbearable. Find a way to befriend yourself and picking up hobbies are so important because it gives you something to focus on and when you see improvement in the hobby you enjoy doing, its kinda like a confidence boost to yourself (I picked up playing the ukulele). Also I know this is easier said than done especially to those who have social anxiety, but it is so fun to take yourself out and go to a park or just go for a bike ride and get something to eat. There’s nothing wrong w being by yourself whiles you’re out or eating alone and trust me most of the time nobody even notices since they’re so wrapped up in themselves. When I felt at my worst and extremely lonely, it felt like me vs them which is further isolating, when in reality it’s just me and other people trying to figure it out in this lifetime.",lonely,Some advice and positivity,2020-08-03 02:19:46

2974,accountjustforreddit,1596384728,1,"I opened my old drafts today and, discovered,
There were a lot of things I never said, which I should have,
I've built emotions in folders,
which I never opened again.
Stories and phrases,
which I never dared to edit.
Which mostly narrates about people in my life and the stories with them,
some just facts, or even numerical.

It just stays there,
As a memory,
Like a block of words,
Some good, some bad.
Wrenching and comforting at the same.
As a pile of phrases,
stacked up in different folders,
Nor hold any meaning or purpose in another person's life anymore,
Once they meant so much to you,
that you took all the time in the entity to gear back reminisce a day you've spent together,
To pen the quality, you've admired the most,
laid it down in less poetic words to treasure it for the future,
Two years later you go back to it,
Just to see how the bond isn't the same anymore.

On the other hand,
It's a beautiful memoir, just like your last favorite song, it stays fresh beyond time,
Which could send you across to the person again,
You could also share the folder with them,
Cherishing, re-read, and re-live the moment.
You talk about how you've grown together with time,
how you've adored every moment,
even the silliest ones and,
It just feels yesterday because nothing has changed.

Tiny bits of papers holding lines about
people and stories from past and present.
Phrases which are unedited potential terrible tiny tale,
I asked myself, ""when I'm gonna use all of them in real-time?""
Probably during the next quarantine?
But NO,
I'm just leaving those stories there, just like people in it.
You don't carry everyone with you throughout your life, even though you would love to.
It should be mutual; they should also be willing to walk along.
The right ones would just be traveling with you,
far or near sometimes even in a parallel universe, which is just a call or text away.
But both the stories are equally beautiful at some point of time in life,

2983,MrKingSimp,1596377173,1,"I’ve never struggled with finding friends in school. I have a large friend group and multiple friend groups. I have a lost a few friends but also gained some solid ones as well. They have helped me on multiple occasions with advice and trying out new life experiences I would have never done otherwise. I’m very grateful for my friends and I’m sure they are grateful of me, but when it comes to romantic relationships is where I’ve struggled my whole life.

Every girl I’ve ever “talked” to has chosen someone else over me or has put me in the friendzone. From when I was young and naive in elementary school telling this girl I liked her to just recently a few days ago getting friendzoned by a girl I’ve been talking to for 2 months I don’t get it anymore. It feels like I’ve never been given the chance by anyone to experience what it’s like to be in a romantic relationship. Last year this girl I fell deeply for led me on for attention after making my feelings to her very clear that I liked her. I still haven’t moved on from her, even though she had moved on from me. The girls I’ve chased have only ever used for me assurance or for attention and would never consider me being their SO. My whole life (19 years old) I have never had a girlfriend, had my first kiss, or held someone’s hand. I fear that I lack experience that when (and if) the time comes, I will be too naive and inexperienced. Since I never been someone’s boyfriend idk if I’d make a good one, most likely not since I lack experience, however it just doesn’t make sense to me how unlucky it feels when it comes to girls with me. I’ve seen several of my friends who we would banter with that would never get with someone, get into relationships and it has left me wondering what am I doing wrong. I’m one of the only people in my friend group who has no “game” and i feel left out when they have discussions about their SO and experiences. At the end of the day, I know I only need myself and I am content with myself, but the times I’ve had with connecting and bonding with someone of the opposite sex felt surreal. I’ve just never made it past the “talking stage” and don’t know if I ever will.

I don't really have many good friends, and the ones that I think I have rarely if ever talk to me. I haven't talked to most of my college friends at all since March when this all started. Nobody seems to want to reach out and talk to me which is fantastic.

My parents don't talk to me at all really. For example my dad didn't say a single word to me today, and my mom talked to a grand total of 3 times, 1) asking about where my dad was, 2) telling me there's donuts, and 3) telling me to check the mail. So I got a solid 20 seconds of someone in my house actually acknowledging my existence today which is better than usual I guess.

A little back story I dont know what I have I've never seen a doctor about it but I'd say at least once every couple of months i have suicidal thoughts i feel such a crushing loneliness that I feel a weight on my chest. 

I dont have a bad life I have a good family albeit flawed and a girlfriend who loves me (for now at least) theres no major problems with the relationship just minor annoyances. Though I cant shake the feeling that no one gets me. 

I put a lot of pressure on myself to do something with my life I'm 25(M) and have a decent paying job though the hours aren't great, though kn no way could I call it fulfilling work. Because of my job I can sometimes get sleep deprived for instance as I'm writing this I've only had 3 hours sleep. 

Today is my best friends birthday and all I feel is lonliness; to the point where I've left his gathering and am now on top a hill in my car writing this shit staring at the sunset. My girlfriend has made no move to try and comfort me while shes still at the gathering while if our roles were reversed I would of tried to cheer her up. My parents dont seem very interested in my problems unless their the ones bringing it up  I tried to have conversation with my dad earlier today and it was like talking to a wall.

3010,CantGetOutOfDepress,1596345558,1,"I went all through my childhood with acquaintances which were basically people that I talked to in school or occasionally hung out with after school. I wasn't close to any person. I can't even say I have a ""best friend"". I'm not close to anybody on that level. It really started to affect me when I got to 11th grade and realized I didn't have a friend group. At that point I realized I messed up my middle school and early junior year by not making friends. At that point people already had established friend groups and I wasn't just randomly going to be accepted in one. Basically, my high school years consisted of me staying in my house on Friday and Saturday nights. Sad life, I know. Hell, the only party I ever attended in high school was when I tagged along with a guy that lives on my street that I kind of knew. I kind of figured things might change when I got to college because I'd take making friends more seriously, and I was mostly right. I made a few friends at university, but it's an out of state school far from home, so I pretty much only see them during the school year. It is definitely harder to form deep friendships with people I'm only seeing half the year, so I guess my friends in college are nothing more than acquaintances too...

It's been 2 years since I graduated high school, and I'm more lonely than ever. Summer 2020 has completely reminded me why High School was rough for me. I work, come home, watch movies, play video games, repeat. This cycle has no end in sight. I have nobody to talk to, nobody to hang out with. I've barely had human interaction other than my parents since March. I wake up in the morning and have zero texts. I go on social media and see people I follow from high school having a blast this summer partying and chilling. That puts me into further depression. I'm 20 and I feel like I don't have the power to do anything but sit in a dark room in front of my television.

Before I even dated him I wasn't even aware of what weed was, so I guess you can say I was pretty naive &amp; innocent. The only reason I agreed to a relationship with this person was because one time we met and I got really wasted and we end up having sex. I don't remember anything except that he threw me on floor ect. U get the picture...I don't want to say anything cause if it was rape I don't remember it. 

However I broke up with this dude after I had a bad trip on LSD. Even with junkies I felt like an outsider. But ya they were attracted to drugs like a moth to the flame... ( You know what I mean) 


So LSD really messed me up I only took it twice but after that I definitely felt like my brain just went a bit to close to the edge of my own sanity. Now love for example terrifies me. Every time I like someone it's like I'm high so therefore my body goes into a state of terror.

This actually not the point of why I was here... I just noticed this story is way to long so I am Gona make it short.

I typed up the email and sent it, what I wrote was along the lines of that I’m interested in welding and wood work and I like the workshop owner’s designs and I also asked if I could have a tour of the workshop and/or get work experience there.
The next day, I got a reply back and the guy was fine with it and asked what time and date would suit me to meet him at the workshop as well as if it was a school or independent work experience thing due to insurance.
My dumbass read through it and then immediately deleted it and went to the ‘trash bin’ and permanently deleted it. I did this since I felt that I wouldn’t do that work experience and my mental health problems were affecting me heavily at that time. 
After I deleted the email, the weeks passed and my parents kept asking me if I’ve received a email back yet, I kept lying and saying I haven’t got one yet. It happened again today, but after I said the same lie again, they said that I should go to the workshop after school which I replied that the amount of school work I get would make my school life hard if balancing work experience. My parents got that but then they said I should go during the next school holidays, I couldn’t come up with anything to reply with and now I’m here.
To sum this up, I feel awkward about going to the workshop as I’ve deleted the email from the owner and kept lying to my parents about not receiving a email back. Thanks for taking the time to read this rambling.

TL:DR, I deleted an email from a workshop about me going there for work experience, mainly since of my mental health problems. And I lied to my parents about not receiving a email back when they asked me about it and now they want me to go to the workshop during the next school holidays (I’m in my last year of high school).

My first boyfriend broke up with me after a fight despite me wanting to work things out together 

I was almost kicked out twice of my college theatre program due to my professors being ableist

I've been stuck at home all day every day with my emotionally abusive and neglectful parents who are also stealing money from me. I'm stuck living with them because I have a bunch of chronic illnesses so I can't go out in public due to the pandemic, which has also left me jobless.

My friends are all busy with work or their own relationships with their partners.

My pain management program that I waited almost a year for turned out to be a total rip off.

I was always told that after high school my life would get so much better but it seems like it's only gotten worse. When I finally got into my first relationship, I thought things are finally about to start falling into place and that good things would start to happen. Only for my heart to get completely broken.

No one.
Graduated high school at what cost? Lots but I done it anyway but I also feel empty in this accomplishment.
Days go on with irregularities nothing really changes like a prison cell or a new game start up in a campaign just the same things go on.
Couldn't keep close relationships even if I tried.
I got asked what's wrong with myself to be honest sadly I wouldn't know where to start.
Showers feel good but only for a short time like a good night's sleep but it gets monotonous.
I observe others quietly like a animal in a cage in the pet store curious on real human interaction but I'm stuck in a internal cage.
Purchased meaningless items to fill the void I don't consume I just try to find a filler for the black void of emptiness.
I was a young Chad but I broke like a 2x4 plank I thought I was made of iron but I was wrong.

How do I tell you that I still dream of you after after almost 30 years?  That when I saw your framed by the sun, my heart leapt.  That you looked beautiful in the dress you wanted to wear to homecoming with me, but I was too stupid and scared to act.  That I should have kissed you in the rain.

You have a family now, and a husband, and I have a son and a wife who will never know about this hidden room in my memory where I love you still.

We would laugh together, and talk about a life in a world we could scarcely imagine.  We watched a day full of movies at the theater for a buck a ticket, laughing at the ones that sucked, or just walking right out and into the next one.

I don't want to die.  I'm scared it's going to hurt so much more soon.  Some of these days have been the worst pain I've ever had to endure.  I don't want anyone to see me break.  I don't want sympathy.  I want to run screaming out of this accursed body.

I want to be young and beautiful like I was when we met.  I want to feel healthy.

I want to feel both desire and desirable one last time.

I want to be in the pool with you, feel your body intertwined around mine, the heat of your mons pressed against my thigh in the water, growing with intensity as we held each other close and looked into each other's eyes, our breath coming quick as we felt each other's desire.

3041,uniqueorange227,1596325237,1,"I feel like I’m throwing a pity party by writing this, but I feel so empty and alone that I don’t know what to do. 

I’m 16 years old, male, blah blah. I’ll write more about myself at the end of this.

I guess I should just begin with whatever comes to mind first. My dad was recently diagnosed with cancer, or what they’re calling an aggressive, metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. It has invaded his lymph nodes and his spine and spine areas. The oncologist said traditional chemotherapy or radiation won’t help what he has, and that he probably doesn’t have much longer to live. If he does live very long, it’ll be because of a life support machine (assuming it continues to grow and spread, which will inhibit his ability to breathe on his own eventually). His diagnosis has been hard on my entire family, but I feel like I have a responsibility to keep putting on a brave face for them, because me showing that I’m not ok would just be another stress on them. I’ve already had a few breakdowns that they have seen and it just always makes things worse. 

His diagnosis came long after COVID-19 became an issue here in the US. It has made hospital and other health visits difficult and hectic, but that’s out of my control obviously. 

But on another topic, the virus will prevent me from going back to school for the autumn semester this August. That means I definitely won’t be able to have any social interaction. For some context, I’m an early-college student, so I take classes on a college campus full time. But now, I’ll be taking all my classes online in my bedroom. 

The previous issue with my school situation wouldn’t bother me so much if it weren’t for the fact that I don’t have any friends. I’m single, I don’t have anyone really to speak to. My phone will pretty much have no notifications from here on out which weirdly hurts. 

Me not having friends is probably my own fault, just by the way. I’ve had pretty bad general anxiety and social anxiety for quite some time, and I truly feel like I don’t understand how to talk to people in public. But now that I felt some tiny amount of courage to do it, the pandemic says no!!!

There was a time when I used to find refuge from the loneliness in my sleep. But these days my sleep only leads me to nightmares or frequent sleep paralysis. The nightmares feel so targeted at all of my soft spots and issues, and they’re only getting worse. 

I’m losing hope in life honestly. I spend most days trying to busy myself with chores or errands, or just staring at the ceiling fan above my bed. I know it sounds dramatic, but I’m losing motivation honestly. There’s no good enough distraction for the loneliness honestly. Even during times I’m busy, I sometimes check my phone stupidly hoping I have a notification from someone, honestly I don’t even know who, it’s not like I have contacts in my phone anymore. And every time I see a blank screen I feel like my heart cracks a bit more. 

I don’t know why I’m writing this, I guess I just needed to get the words out. And maybe I’m stupidly hoping another set of eyes will read it and I can at least feel heard. 

At the beginning of this I said I’d put more info about myself, so here it is: I’m 16 years old, male, and truthfully just lonely and empty. I’m a pretty average person I guess, as for the outwards stuff I’m pretty normal I think. Skinny, brown hair and brown eyes. Sometimes I feel like I’m OK looking at the very least, but other times the self-loathing tells me I’m ugly and gross, so I’m not a good judge of myself anymore. I truly do feel ugly and gross. 

Honestly I don’t think I have much to offer anyone besides dedication and heart. But even at that, I don’t think my heart is worth a whole lot anyway. I wish I had something to give, but I really don’t think I do anymore. To be fully honest, if I had money I think I’d be paying people to be my friends. Maybe one day that can be what I have to give.

There was always some sound, because I had quite a few roommates, some of which were energetic people who produced noise and blasted music all day. Here, there's barely any sound. All I'll hear is people passing by my door to get to and from their own apartments, about 4 times a day or so.

3051,RSD_2001,1596318035,1,"I am 19, I’ve been going to college for 3 years and I’m going back in September. I’ve been called attractive a couple of times so I’m not bad looking and I get called smart often. But my personality comes across as boring to other people. I only have one close friend and maybe two others who are ok. I have social anxiety (although I’ve not been diagnosed). I have a massive problem with socialising, I can’t keep a conversation going AT ALL, even with my closest friend(it’s just me saying one or two words every now and then while she does all the talking). I haven’t seen her in two years so we talk on FaceTime mostly. It’s basically the only time anyone talks to me and the only time I have a conversation with someone my age. I hate messaging people, I just feel nothing when I have text conversations, it bores me and I can never think of what to say. My main problem is that along with my social anxiety, I also can’t think of anything to say ever. In college I am constantly looking down at my phone as an escape from the anxiety. I try to look up from my phone at times to see if I can join in on conversation or if anyone starts talking to me, but it ends in me just staring around at people awkwardly, so I look back at my phone; and whenever someone actually tries to talk to me, I either give a really boring reply or just end up making myself look like an idiot. 

A lot of people have messaged me in the past (people from college) possibly to get closer to me, and I can have a conversation most of the time when they initiate it, but because of my hate of texting, and poor conversation skills, I never messaged any of them first, which I feel really bad about, but I have no interest in messaging at all, which has led to nobody messaging me at all. There’s people I wish i was closer with, but I can’t talk. 
I’m not a bad looking person, I’ve been called attractive by a couple of people, and I’ve had girls interested in me. But I also feel like maybe my standards are too high :/ I have rejected people because I felt nothing towards them, it’s like all the people that like me I have no interest in, and the people I like, I couldn’t talk to. I’ve tried tinder and bumble but it just made me feel worse about myself, I couldn’t make a conversation and ended up getting blanked or not many matches. I have two more years left in college and I’m dreading it, the last 3 years have felt overwhelming and lonely, and I feel like the next two won’t be any different, unless I end up meeting someone who understands me, which is unlikely to happen. 

I have a part time job at a cafe, which I guess is helping my anxiety a bit but it’s mainly older people as customers and nobody my age, I am doing well with college work but my social life is non existent. My life is work college and listening to music 24/7, I just want someone to hang out with and talk to on a close level. 

On top of all this I feel like I am wasting my life. I haven’t done anything very fun my whole life, I’ve only ever had family days out (which is great, but not what I need at this age). I want to travel, hang out with people, go to concerts etc (I have tickets to two concerts but nobody wants to go with me, except my family out of sympathy). I also don’t even know why I’m on the college course I’m on, I like it but it’s not really what I want to do job-wise. I don’t have many options as I have not many qualifications, I’d like to do something in music, photography or writing but all of that seems out of reach at this point in time.

This is going to be a long post because i am asking kindly for inputs, maybe I will figure out what to do. Sorry :/

Story time:

So my situation is about learning  what I actually am. I changed the town a year and a half ago because I would've regret not to try to be with a guy (we've met in some student organisation that had multiple locations in the country). A year later we've separated, to be more specific this early January. I was in a pretty domestic relationship, I did nothing relevant while we were together, just come home from work then gaming and/or netflix - which he did the same (apparently i stopped him from doing things, I was actually trying to spend time with him). I asked multiple times to go out and have a beer, or go together to boardgame nights and meet people, he just didn't want to. That was his lifestyle. One of the reasons he broke up with me is because he thought I couldn't live on my own but I actually had no friends and i was pretty depressed and became really insecure. I also didn't feel ok with the idea of going alone downtown in the bars and try to meet people because i was with him and in my mind it would've been nice to be together and socialize. He tried somehow to introduce me to his friends Him considering that I have an issue didn't help at all,and in the end  I became what he thought I was. His friends we're not into controversial discussions about life, they just talked about how to get money and what else they currently own. In my hometown I have multiple friends and acquaintancesand currently I am in an ok state of mind because I've visited my hometown for two weeks recently and still didn't have the chance to see everybody. They helped me get my sh\*t together for now.

I finally settled in January somehow, moved out, paying rent somewhere else, bought a TV, a bike, planned to go to concerts and festivals with friends from my hometown. If I could just bring everybody where I live, I would and most of them they would too. The town I live in has massive potential but at the end of the day I do not enjoy any of the things that has to offer. Or actually had to offer, corona time.

In March a lock down happened in the country and there are still restrictions. The one way I've met everybody I know, I figured,  it was through friends and in bars mostly, which are currently closed.

Since March I've been working from home in a 32mp\^2 flat with since recently no human contact, just an insecure hi at the store and that's it. Solitude can be helpful, it makes you live with yourself and question yourself. I am a software developer for a living (occasionally have to be present at the office here lately) and I realized that what keeps me here currently is the job, that's it. I Or maybe not? I do still have the hopes to get better, I guess, somehow, because I refuse to remind myself of this place this way, if I move back. And yet again move back and do what? 

I figured i enjoy what I do but i am not passionate about it. I hardly find things interesting anymore and actually i don't know if I ever did. I was just surrounded by people doing totally different stuff, and I lived through them, finding out how this world works, reading a bunch of stuff and go talk about it by night. From that talkative person I've become this really insecure person.

I imagined the situation where everybody from my hometown would die, what is there left to do? Do we really need people around us? We are just a bunch of mammals that get depressed because we are programmed to get depressed if we are not surrounded by other humans. What goals do you guys have in life, if any? What you guys do about the fact that this Earth has a bunch of stuff to offer?",lonely,Hey,2020-08-02 07:25:22

At one point i used all that pinned up energy to transform myself, to work harder on myself and to become who i want to be - physically and mentally. I push myself harder than i ever have before and i never felt this powerful. Why am i telling you this? because this could very well be your story. always remember: if someone - whether that's a friend or a partner - treats you like an option, they don't deserve to be your choice. Don't let short-term feelings of sadness and disappointment get in the way of reaching long-term targets. Don't let people bring you down, you're so much better than what they - and you - see in yourself. 

People are intimidated by the prospect of your success and they'll doubt you along the way... so what? Don't let that negativity hold you down and surround yourself with positive energy only. If that means cutting everyone out of your life that fails to value and appreciate you for who you are, do it.

i still have no friends, really - not anybody that i can really hang out with and confide into, really. dating is so hard for me, i think, because i invest all of my social and emotional headspace into this single person - and i’m sure that for more well-adjusted people, that sort of attention can be pretty overwhelming. scary, even. sometimes it just feels like people are dancing around what they really feel, trying to keep quiet the riskier parts of their own psyche. but i don’t have the time or the willpower to wait for that.

i want someone who tells me exactly what he feels. i want someone willing to go as fast as our powder-keg romance could take us, and who wouldn’t be so scared to burn with me. i want someone who’ll ache for me with every bone in his body, and who’ll spend his days counting the minutes until he can see me again. i want someone just as sad, lonely, needy, and bat-shit insane as me, and with whom i could find a mutual comfort and reliance and admiration. i want someone who’ll lean on me as his shelter from the world, when the rest of society has done him so wrongly. i want someone that i can truly, unquestionably, unconditionally MEAN SOMETHING to.

We went back to my car and they kissed me goodbye and they said what they wanted to do next time we hung out, but its been 24 hours and they havent text me back.

Knowing myself, I’ll probably crack eventually and contact them again. The person who I thought was my truest friend didn’t respond anymore after I stopped replying to them even though we used to talk all the time, every day.

Prior to COVID-19, my social calendar consisted mostly of large-scale events, such as mixers and happy hours that were open to all. I would also occasionally attend house-parties where I was one out of 100+ guests on the invite list. And while even then I struggled with not being able to move past the superficial degree of my social interactions, it was still better than nothing.

Now, I see a lot of people being able to maintain healthy and busy social lives by doing activities in small groups with only their more ""intimate"" friends. And I realize that I don't have anyone I can reach out to or make such plans with. Any attempts I've made have been met with awkward, tepid, and noncommittal responses. People are fine being friendly and making small talk in a large group environment like a party or a popular bar, but asking for someone's individualized time and effort during a pandemic seems to be too great of an ask. I also live in a big city where people are generally noncommittal anyway.

Never decided to get a job and was completely shut in for a while....  didn't even go outside or anything for a few months.  

My mental health kept getting worst and about a month or 2 ago I decided to get a bit better.. started going out a bit more, started walking into mom and pop shops, gas stations, ordered food... I even went to a mental helath clinic and found out I don't have psychosis but they diagnosed me with MDD (Major Depression Disorder).

But this is coming during a time were my family doesn't love me anymore because I am someone different. I walk different, talk different. I hold my madness in my mind and never let it out. Its all self hatred anyways .  

But the worst part I did something I wasn't suppose to do and my perception of life is so much different now and the meds are helping me out a bit.. but it just wont be the same... my family loves me. But they all say its better for me to leave because im old and I abandoned everyone.. even life itself.

I’m feeling more alone than ever right now. But I did it to myself. I couldn’t stay with her because I wasn’t happy and it showed. I still care for her tho so what was i supposed to do? I ended it and tried to stay friends but that didn’t work. I don’t think I explained why I was doing it well enough. I think she hates me now. She left me on read a week ago. 

I didn’t go on the trip with my family because I didn’t want to be stuck in a car with them for hours. I would’ve lost my patience before we left the state.

I know I sound like a dick but I’ve just been chasing happiness and love at any cost. No matter who it hurt, i cut out anyone i didn’t feel comfortable with. Now everyone’s gone and I’m still not happy. It’s a shitty cycle. I’m alone for too long, I find someone who I romanticize in my head and then they don’t live up to it and I can’t let go of the ways they wronged me or the times they’ve made me feel bad so I just let them go. It’s not anyone’s fault but my own. I should’ve just gotten over it and stayed with her, at least then I wouldn’t be so alone. But I didn’t and now I’m in the lonely part of the cycle again.

whenever i see posts of people asking for someone to talk to and feeling alone i want to message them so bad because i feel their pain but i simply cant. i cant message them first, i usually cant comment and i just end up scrolling past and feeling horrible about myself. i just want to be there for others and make sure they dont feel the way i do but anxiety stops me from doing so and i hate it so much. my mind is just full with thoughts of me being a bother, a burden or just simply annoying. thats why i prefer it when people message me first because i feel like they actually want to talk to me. at least i hope so.

and what do girls want from guys? a nice personality? charming ? successfull? or they just want someone that makes them happy?

its like figuring out a jigsaw puzzle when i try to talk to a girl. feels a bit easier when i talk to guys. but i struggle with that too.

they end up ignoring me so its me ignoring all the human race or i have to chase other people.

I’ve had selective mutism since I was little, basically a rare disorder in which I am mute in places I’m not comfortable, but talk fine with people like my parents. I had this all the way up to fifth grade (I had a few friends here and there but they would disappear easily). So I thought that magically I would gain the skills to make friends in middle school. I was proven wrong lol. I didn’t realize how essential elementary school was to making friends and groups and stuff like that. 

So middle school was boring and I got by with one friend, who would hang out with me every couple months. Then we sort of fell out by the end of middle school. Gained friends in the end of eighth grade, but lost them because I realized I was boring. Like really, I don’t talk at all and I’m just so awkward and I hate it. Cut to me in highschool now, and I don’t hang out with anybody, and I’m beginning to think I’m just going to be stuck this way.

Friendship is a relation you choose for yourself with a person. A friend don't abandon you. They stick through all times, good and bad alike.

While a friend maybe someone you have fun with but above this a friend is someone who is there for you when you are sad and feel like there's no tomorrow.

A friend maybe someone who likes to spend time with you but also when you don't feel like it and still they respect your decision.

A friend gives you compliments and say good stuffs that you want to hear but also gives criticism about you and speak to you about your bad things you don't want to hear.

A friend helps you to get to the top but also pulls you out from the depths of your loneliness.

A friend is someone who makes you feel wanted not only physically but also emotionally.

A friend maybe reserved infront of you and everyone else but protects you when everyone else is against you.

A friend may not talk to you for months but thinks about you everyday, And your memories together.

A friend is not someone who is with you for his gain but someone who is there with you even in your losses.

A friend is someone who puts you at ease not only physically but also your mind. 

A friend is someone with whom you can discuss your deepest fears and stupidest fear. Your life long journey as well as your next day. Your strengths and your weakness. 

A friend is someone who doesn't walk out on you with for a single mistake or imperfection but helps you get it fixed. 

A friend may not be the guy/girl sitting beside you but maybe that old guy/lady who lives in the neighborhood who talks about your day and your life and shares with you their days, experience. 

If you can't find that friend then try being that friend. A friendship can arise of a situation that you would have never expected in your whole life. Be strong, be hopeful. There is someone out for you.

3108,Gozii55,1596289404,1,"This basically sums up my love hate relationship with being an introvert. When I know I can block a night off and do absolutely nothing but what I want to do, it's incredible. I can make whatever dinner I want, have some beers, put my chair super close to my tv, play some video games, stay awake till 3am, sleep in till 10. It's literally better than drugs for me. I think I love it because i don't have to do anything to impress or deal with another person. I don't have to worry if they're having a good time, if they like me, if I'm being funny or upbeat enough. If I'm tired, I can go take a nap. If I'm hungry I can go eat. And if I want to stare at my wall and just think, no one's going to barge in my room asking me what I'm doing with my life or make me go out and do something I don't want to do.

The problem is I've been in a few relationships and this side of me has crept in and it's not attractive. Even if you're dating an introvert, this selfish side of never wanting to do anything but what you want to do is not a good look. With that being said, I hunger for a partner just like everyone in this subreddit. It burns inside of me and I know it's greater than my want to be alone. I just haven't faced the reality of how to get past this. 

I was raised in a fairly sheltered house. I was able to make time by myself fun. I would make up stories in my head, or sometimes pretend to play guitar in front of a fake audience. I'd talk out my philosophies with myself and have arguments about decisions I had made or things other people did to me. I became my own support system in a strange way and it's now unravelling as I've not only passed childhood, but I'm going into my 30's in 2 years. 

I feel like I haven't grown up enough. I played golf with two 24-25ish guys the other day and they were so cool and well spoken. They played without a care in the world, and I felt completely overwhelmed by this. It hit me how immature I was compared to them and honestly it's made me want to be better for real for the first time. It's very hard when you have to face an example of where you should be in life and realize that you aren't even close. 

I've been through lots of opportunities to improve, but the realization that I'm 28 and still get giddy over a night of pizza and video games is embarrassing. I know my change needs to begin with improving myself before I can get over my fear of being lonely. I can never have a successful relationship until this happens and I'd highly suggest others take this advice as well because I know it to be true.

Go find someone who represents the place you want to be in and find a way to get there. We are creatures of observation, it's the best way for us to learn.

3122,M2KKA,1596274598,1,"Hello,

I need to get this out.

I'm a 19 year old guy in Australia, and I am alone. I have some friends that I have no real common bond with and family who like arguing. Sometimes we hang out, sometimes they shout, most of the time we are separated and I hate it.

I work at McDonald's as a supervisor and I am the ""world's best customer service crewmember"". People tend to like my bubbly personality however most of the time I am the complete opposite, I am quite reserved and depperessed. 

I have friends I hang out with sometimes however they tend to throw me under the bus quite alot. It's banter but also personal. I'm usually picked on for being the only virgin with no friends that are girls and I have been told that I am... well... the title of this post.

My family don't like me alot eather, they tend to argue over what my mum did in the past. I have nothing to do with what they argue and yet somewhat I am in the middle of this conflict and therefore makes me the root of all evil (Or a big fuckin part of it). I send my brothers money every now and then since they think my mum extorted my father. I d only argue that fact but They still don't talk to me eather.

I also am held back from progressing with jobs, I want to do something more impactful but my back (shermans and scoliosis at a severe form) and self of steam hold me back.

Currently while writing this I am contemplating about my life at a park. 

I feel so alone.

3128,Derfper,1596262818,1,"I remember being 8 years old and walking into my moms room at night, and telling her i wanted to kill myself. Not only did mom and dads divorce upset me, but i had absolutely no friends, bullied and picked on a lot. Before the divorce i saw my father beaten half to death in front of me. If anybody remembers the scene from 8 mile where hes junped in a trailer park, it was kinda like that. In a trailer park, jumped by several dudes, and i wasnt but 6 feet away when it happened. Mom had already separated and moved somewhere else while i finished school there. He was laying in a pool of blood and i swore to god he was dead. But he wasnt, but he did become addicted to spice for 6 years, smoked it in front of me with his friends when i tried to visit. He was diagnosed with drug induced schizophrenia and epilepsy. He has delusions hes one of the four horsemen from the book of revelations. And has committed crimes according to that belief. Mom mentally abused me. I was often gas lighted and manipulated. We often got into huge fights (nothing physical ever)just words like r*t*rd or f*gg*t cuz im bisexual. I had tons of fights at school. I graduated from ""alternative school"" i was sent there for busting a dudes head open after he was messing with me. My fiance just cheated on me. Was with her for 4 years. I made her my entire world. Really only wanted to keep livong to be with her. Im 21 years old. But i just dont see a good reason to try anymore. Maybe im just a little bitch and other people have had it worse off. But to live for myself? Thats a concept i cant grasp. Im always told im nice, smart, funny and thats not me bragging. In fact, i dont believe it. Im no better than anyone else in this world. I make mistakes and im human. What would i have to offer anybody? Especially when the girl i thought i loved cheated on me, and all i ever did was be the man she wanted and needed. She really made me feel like i was special to her. Like i actually mattered to someone. But now i know i didn't matter enough. After all the gifts, the proposal, the memories. How could i ever do anything for anybody ever again if they are just gonna betray me. I dont have the will to do anything.

3144,justanother0077,1596255972,1,"I’ve been incredibly lonely for the last 4 years. I’ve felt like I’ve had no friends at all because 3 years ago, I had just come out of about a year in a severe state of depression where I isolated myself from all of my friends. When I came out of that really bad place, I discovered that pretty much all my friends had moved on without me and that they were no longer my friends. I’ve felt so lonely ever since. I’ve genuinely been worried I will never have a friend again as I’ve had no luck making new friends. Over the past 3 years I’ve also tried reaching out to my old friends multiple times and never had any luck making a lasting connection, which was so upsetting to me because I missed those relationships so much. 

I’m making this post because it is so critical that you do not give up. I’ve given up so many times, but then I reached such a severe low where I was so so lonely during this pandemic and tried again to reach out to my old friends as basically a last-ditch effort. I did this one month ago and at first had a lot of phony text conversations that were awkward and went no where. However, I did actually start to make a real connection with 3(!!!) of my old friends and now have been talking to them regularly. Two of them even asked me to hang out this past weekend and it was so much fun.  I feel infinitely better than I have in years because I genuinely don’t feel alone anymore. Keep in mind these 3 friends that I’ve reconnected with - I’ve tried reaching out before over the past few years and it just never worked before now.

I think what’s been really helpful in reconnecting is that everyone is doing really shitty because of this pandemic. No one is happy, a lot of people are having seriously hard times dealing with work or issues with their family as well as trying to not get sick, and it’s just a stressful time in general. I think part of the reason I’ve had a hard time reconnecting up until now is I always felt this need to be “fake happy” just to present a nice face to the world because that’s what I expected everyone wanted. This pandemic has made me feel much freer to actually talk about how I’m doing (which is not great) bc I feel like I will be less judged, and I think I’m being a lot more authentic and act less phony because of it. Acting less phony or fake happy definitely makes you more relatable especially when everyone else around you is having a hard time as well. 

Anyways, please just keep trying to make connections with people. This is a great time to message your old friends and just say “hey, hope you’re doing alright during this crazy time, would love to catch up.” It could be awkward and it might be for most of the situations, and honestly most of them might not go anywhere, but all you really need is to make a real connection with one person to not feel so alone anymore.

I called my boyfriend to let him know I was being followed and he was unbothered to say the least; almost like he didn’t believe me.

Some of them even close acquaintances. But not really “friends.” And that's because in my mind, the definition of a “friend” is somebody who not only connects with you &amp; trusts you, but also takes time out of their schedule to meet up &amp; do things with you often. Obviously, during this Covid-19 pandemic, meet-up's are not really all that possible without putting yourself at risk with contracting the virus.

Just for some perspective:  
I am an international student who is studying in a University abroad, and the place I am living in is in a countryside and not in a city. Majority of the students in my cohort are also locals, and I feel like I'm left out as being an international student there and I am unable to click with anyone, plus living in a countryside, it's the same concept where the locals here are those farmer-type of people, and the nearest city is 2 hours away.  
Here it goes:  
Not sure how to go about on this, but every time I am alone by myself, I just can't stop thinking about how lonely I am and that I have no friends. Over the past few months, things that have interested me just doesn't seem to be exciting to me anymore. I used to enjoy music, playing the piano, photography, going hiking or trekking outdoors, watching movies, Netflix, Youtube etc. But these days I just can't find the motivation to do any of these. Every day I wake up in the morning, I just lie in bed for hours on end not doing anything productive, and by night time, the same thing happens, I just lie in bed for hours and hours thinking about life. I still would like to go out and meet people and walk in the park and stuff but because of the current COVID-19 restrictions that just makes life harder for me. I tried playing games or reading books, especially those where you get to roleplay, but even then I feel bored after about 1 or 2 hours because it is just repetitive. In terms of music, I stop listening to them because the songs I like are the emotional ones and it just makes me feel like crying everytime I hear them. Even in terms of food, I have no appetite at all and constantly feeling nauseous, and even my favourite foods does not interest me anymore.

I do have friends that will occasionally ask me to hang out with them, and we all have fun and such. But at the end of the day, I when I am home again by myself, I just sulk back down to my old depressing self, and still feel like the world is against me? I have no idea why? Maybe it's because my friends all have their own social life, and they all have their special ones they call their own, and I feel envious or jealous of them? They have other friends that they get to hang out with, and I am just one of those people, but to me they are my everything. I also feel scared sometimes that I will lose them because I may be too clingy or needy, that's why I don't initiate much of the chats with them, I actually limit myself and tell myself that I can only text them once every few days so that I don't seem clingy or needy. I appreciate that sometimes they do initiate the chat with me and starts a conversation, but most of the time, if I do not initiate a conversation, I will literally have zero messages in my inbox, and this just makes me feel like no-one cares about me. There is one time where I did a trial experiment and not start a conversation with anyone for a month, and that whole month I have not gotten a single text, and that was really heart breaking for me to the point I almost commited suicide.

In terms of family, I never had a supporting family, everything I do my family will always be against it. Even if I talk with my cousins they will most likely not be interested and just ignore my messages all the time. I desperately want to have a pet but I do not have the money to own one, because if anything happens to them I don't think I will be able to pay for their veterinary fees.

It’s like, the things I want most I’m not able to attain, community, a partner, friends. I always am the one to initiate or ask others questions, but they don’t ask me questions if I don’t ask them, like they don’t want to understand me better. And there’s people who barely get around to talking to me, only after days if not weeks if ever at all. People who sometimes will just respond with one word. But that’s not just a single person who has only responded with single digit word count, but a lot. No one is willing to know and understand me let alone build a strong connection. Are there any lonely people here? People who are that lonely? Who live life at the end of a rope if not close to the end of the rope, discouraged and disappointed with no end in sight? 

Will anyone see this? Yet again I make myself vulnerable because I’ve tried chitchat and found myself getting nowhere the countless times I’ve gone for that approach. Is anyone out there?",lonely,A question,2020-08-01 12:10:11

A couple hours later, i felt like i wasn't breathing and I was very very scared. I decided to tell my dad what actually happened since he also smokes weed. 

For the next couple nights, I would wake up shaking, not knowing where I was and feeling like i was having that experience again. Then, one night I decided to call my grandma because she's been through this, and my aunt heard, got jealous, and took away my phone (still taken away). Then a day later, I snook my tablet to my dad's house, and she asked if I had it, and I lied because I wanted to do my streaks, and then my dad got pissed and told my aunt the truth. Then suddenly he was mad at my best friend and said I'm not allowed to hang out with her and shit, like fuck you you can't choose who i like and who I have a fucking connection with. And they think shes a fucking drug addict, when weed isn't that fucking bad, and she barely even does it, that was our first time doing it together smfh. 

Then a week or two later, my other friend figured out what happened and told her fucking MOM. Then my aunt, her mom, her and I had to go to dinner and talk about what fucking happened. Like fuck you guys for tricking me into coming to dinner just to set me up like that. I had to tell them what happened, just for her mom not to believe that I have depersonalization. God. Then my friend decided to bring up another fucking friend, who was my other best friend, who smokes weed, so now im not allowed to hang out with her either. Great. Fuck my fucking life.",lonely,i feel so hopeless,2020-08-01 04:37:02
3197,lovedeleted,1596220149,1,"I feel as though the people who do like me are a bit disingenuous to this very scenario. It's like they know where to be to create something but at the point to where they are there at the right time and right place, as soon as I want to say something they speed off. But these same people ask me why I don't talk. They only want me to talk in high pressure scenarios within crowds of people who may not like me and who would try to sabotage any relationship I try to build. I understand that people want that high profile relationship that many people envy but that relationship has to start somewhere. It needs private, personal time to build before it is present to a crowd of people who **will** try to destroy it. If you present it to them too quickly or before it even begins you risk the relationship falling apart before it can even build itself properly.....

-work 12 hrs every day and don't ask for payment bcs it's your fathers shop and it's not making any profit

-go to bed and fantasize about my dreams until i fall sleep
-no friends to go out with(don't even have the time to go out anyway)
-watch my depressed family die inside little by little everyday
-talk to my only friend that's 900km away from me, mostly about our fked up lives

3200,what-thehell,1596216013,1,"I recently broke it off with my *only* best friend of 9 years because of the way she treated me and her continuous indifference and maltreatment. I am left with only two people who aren’t actually friends, but theyre somewhat present once a month. My boyfriend is in a very bad financial state, so we havent been able to even hang out anymore and he is in a bad mood all the time because of it. He refuses to try changing the situation he’s in, so that makes me very angry and then I feel like an awful person afterwards. 

Now I am stuck inside, crying, wondering where did I go SO wrong...to end up in the lowest pit of hell. And the worst part is that, its actually my only life...and I’m breathing...and this isn’t a dream. This is me, wasting my life away, being treated like shit, watching my only values getting overshadowed from the pessimism and negativity inside of me that probably radiates on the outside and drives people away. 

I’ve had enough of this life. If there was a less painful way to do it, I’d do it today. Not even breathe a moment more. I don’t see anything ahead of me but misery. I want out, I need out.

3202,lapiselisabeth,1596215536,1,"I'm 35 now, no partner, no kids and I used to feel lonely sometimes before, missing having more friends/like minded people around and after this year I feel so foolish since I was so rich before without knowing it. 

My best friend was my soulmate, we got each other like I never thought it was possible with a human being. She got diagnosed with cancer in February and died on May 6. My world has totally crumbled since then as she was my best friend, everything, the person I would have talked to right now. I've lost quite a few friendships before this happened over the years, I still have a few ""friends"", well, nice people who reach out now or then but I don't feel connected to them, we have not much in common and I can't talk to them in a more deeply manner. 

My best friend was more rock, my last hope in life, the one I lived for when I felt giving up everything. No worries, I won't ever commit suicide because I promised her but during days like today I just can't bear the hurt and having no one to talk to, no one I feel close to. Since she passed I rarely go out because it also makes me sad that I have no one anymore to share the good stuff with either. 

I've already lost other people I dearly loved and I often wonder why this has to happen to me again and again and how someone like me who's actually talkative, wants to enjoy life and share happiness can cope with seemingly being alone forever. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm just done today, I can only cry. Her family has even gotten over this loss quite well meanwhile because they still have partners or a best friend. I just feel totally alone in this world, doing my nightly walks to distract myself of watching telly and movies to distract myself I sometimes feel like an alien.",lonely,I lost my best friend almost 3 months ago and I feel more lonely than ever before...,2020-08-01 03:12:16

**Mud Runs** \- they come in all difficulty levels and really emphasize community and team work!

**Fitness Classes** \- the more niche, the better! 

**Group Hikes** \- nothing like looking at some dope ass nature to make friends.

**Game Dev Showcases** \- You don't even need to be a dev! Indie devs are always looking for people to test their games!

**Conventions** \- Being a Canadian gamer, I met lots of interesting people at EGLX!

**Niche Interest Groups** \- I found both an Archery Club and HEMA club that I didn't know existed. Met some really cool folks there.
